<h3 id="prologue-plan">Prologue &amp; Plan</h3>
<p>All the members have own perspectives, the narrator keeps switching between them easily, camera follows one character, and then glides with another one, always smooth, just randomly start following a character based on the cash, and where it goes, at what time.
The pricetag of the store.</p>
<p>This story HEIST, will be contrasted with another, the deep and saddening romance one. The chapters may alternate. And so many characetrs are in each story, write them out separately, then copy &amp; paste them alternately between chapters.</p>
<p>So hi guys, this is a new story. It's not supposed to be very philosphical, and I want to make it more coherent and not as random as my last one. With more of a simple heist in it. ETC.
It's about a simple heist, the characters steal something of extreme value. I've wanted to do one of these for a long time, and so here goes. Hopefully it turns out alright aye?</p>
<p>Haha, thanks</p>

<h3 id="one-a-homogeneous-uniform">one: A Homogeneous Uniform</h3>
<p>The Across The Country bus made its way down the slopes and into tourist territory. There was only one of these buses a day, it departed from the neighbouring city and drove three hours through sheep country and farmland towards a hotel called the Management. Every morning for twenty two years the bus left at 7:15 and arrived at the Management at 1:25 with five minutes to spare, for mistakes. </p>
<p>At 1:27, sitting in an office on the second floor, the Human Resources Manager had a slight sweat running down her left cheek when she glanced at her watch, she had five minutes to finish this set of paperwork before the visitors would need her attention.</p>
<p>Greece Marlian who had been working here just under a year as a porter, saw each second ticking by; a minute ago he was in front of the hotel and clearing the last belongings from a room, now he stood waiting as the giant head of a bus turned into view. It was the only bus leading to this isolated part of the country. It drove straight to the hotel and back. It covered the long hours from here to the closest city day after day, it took the same path and parked in the same place every single day. He aligned the sign to indicate where the luggage should be placed, there had been issues in the past.</p>
<p>With the movement of the bus, several processes were put into action, the new restaurant staff in training, Sieg, had a list that he used to help him memorize the locations and where to put the food for each working member who couldn't come to staff dining.</p>
<pre><code>Sieg's List:

- The Porters (2) move all of the luggage first and organize it to move to the rooms. They will have their meals after they finish this,(one hour)
- One receptionist goes to check in the arrivals and provide room keys, he will do all of the talking (thirty minutes)
- The big boss watching the security cameras can't relax and eat until the bus is unloaded, and everything is finished. (one hour) They will be watching every movement of the porters as well.
- The chefs who are on standby for these guests who have just arrived and might order room service at any time.
- Put one meal aside for the day audit who goes through and checks that everything has been done properly and payment has been made accordingly.
</code></pre>

<p>Thirty seconds later Bliss arrived. He received a dirty look from Greece telling him to come earlier. when he put the trolley he was pushing aside and unloaded a sign on the maroon tiles in front of the entrance. The bus came to a halt just as he got there.</p>
<p>“Stop rushing, try to do things on time” Christian said, “It's a bad look, the guests notice it”</p>
<p>The alarms in both porters' back pockets went off simultaneously. They both reached to their butts in black pants with their right hand and switched them off with their index finger. They were dressed exactly the same, black shirt, black pants, and their shoes were the same brand. Only a different size. When they walked together, customers had difficulty telling them apart, all they knew was that they were the same porters in the same place.</p>
<p>Black was the boss of the souvenir shop on the ground floor, he had been the boss here for his second and a half year now; he always had everything proceeding smoothly. He served a customer and glanced at the clock hanging on the wall in front of him, it was tilted a bit, he would fix that. The hands read fifteen past one, that would also be fixed, it was actually 1:29. He politely excused himself in front of his employees and made his way to the back of the hotel. </p>
<p>On the ninth floor, Nina walked to the elevator and pressed the button to go down, it was wet from someone earlier and she wiped her finger on the wall in annoyance. She saw from the window closest to her that below, a bus glided around a roundabout and came to a halt in front of grand doors. Sleek men wearing black immediately rushed out to unload the bags from the new arrivals. They made an organized pile behind them. The passengers got off the bus as soon as the doors opened, they walked down the steps and gathered around in the hotel lobby, it was like the guts of the bus were leaking out. The automatic doors of the hotel stayed open as the sea of people kept passing. 'Ping' the elevator arrived politely and she stepped in.</p>
<p>On the eighth floor she was thinking about the colour of the bus.</p>
<p>On the seventh floor she thought of the porter with blonde hair, he was kind of cute, his butt was nice, but he could be her type. His blonde hair reminded her of Keith. She always regretted Keith.</p>
<p>On the sixth floor she was thinking of Keith, again.</p>
<p>On the fifth floor she realized she wasn't wearing a watch and didn't know if she was late.</p>
<p>On the fourth floor and third floor she tried to remember where she was supposed to go.</p>
<p>On the second floor she thought about the porter again. </p>
<p>Then when the doors opened she looked completely normal.</p>
<p>The lobby was packed with people, these were mostly older people who held all their belongings closely. Outside, the bus was parked, and the blonde haired porter was arranging bags. He was taller than she expected now that she stood level with him. Nina glanced the other way to look for the restaurant, her parents were still waiting for her. She was going to get scolded for arriving late.</p>
<p>Inside the bus the sleep deprived driver turned around to see one passenger remaining. He looked at the bus clock, it was still broken, the red digits were incomprehensible !#@$^!:0h.</p>
<p>“Now, are you getting off or do you want to go back to Christchurch?”</p>
<p>The passenger crawled out of the chair silently, that was what it looked like, crawling. His shoes sparkled in the mid-afternoon sun, his laces were both tied exactly the same way. It didnt take an observant eye to discern. The driver stood aside as the man passed, the man was cleanly shaven as well. The driver checked all of the seats and under them for leftover belongings.</p>
<p>“Thank you” the man said, the bus tilted back when he stepped off, like something far heavier had passed.</p>
<p>1:31pm, most of the luggage had been taken away to the guests' rooms. The man picked his bag up and walked through the doorway all in four steps. He saw the same people from the bus here, they were talking incessantly, excited</p>
<p>Then he saw a man who looked like a Buick rounding the corner, he had straight posture and shoes as bright as stars in the night sky on a clear unpolluted day. He knew it was his boss.</p>
<p>Black rounded the corner, he saw William, a new employee, shouldering a bag and looking at him like a movie. He went up to him and shook his hand.</p>
<p>“I'm glad you're here William” he said. “How was the trip?”</p>
<p>“It was interesting” William said. </p>
<p>“Oh, you enjoyed it? Over time you learn to sleep through the commentary, once you've gone on the bus a few times it all becomes second nature.” Black looked him over, “So I take it you have everything. Shall we get going?”</p>
<p>Black pressed the elevator button and checked his watch, then he checked it again when the doors opened for other passengers at a different floor. He smiled and moved out of their way and stopped smiling when they were unable to see him. </p>
<p>They walked through the lobby and down the corridors, there were people everywhere moving back and forth, a few staff members nodded to Black as they passed, they wore name badges and a uniform which said where they were from. They kept turning corridors and walking along them, then at the end was an elevator which seemed to go somewhere else all together.</p>
<p>“Don't worry, everyone feels lost when they first get here, it's just part of the process, you'll get used to it in no time. I'm just going to take you to Lianna, our Human resources manager, then she'll update you on what to happen?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay, that sounds great”</p>
<p>Black checked his watch again, he had been away from the store for 2 minutes and a few seconds, he knew that they would be getting busy soon and needed his assistance.</p>
<p>They came to an area above reception, Black held it there so that William would get a taste of all the uniforms and types of staff, as well as just how busy it could get in the summer. But William wasn't watching, he looked at the elevator and at the roof.</p>
<p>“This is our administration area” Black raised his hand and moved over a few buttons, the door swung open silently. “Our Human Resources Manager Lianna is in here”</p>
<p>They walked in and stopped at the first door on the left. It was a normal office area with white walls and wooden barriers up to chest high. There were dividers in the inner section but William didn't know about them yet.</p>
<p>Black knocked on the door. </p>
<p>“Come in” Lianna saw that Black was on time, and she still hadn't finished the paperwork, Black was really always on time. She wiped the sweat off her brow again, she might be staying late today to finish all of this. And she still had to do this tour for the new staff every second day.</p>
<p>The door opened and Black came in with his usual smooth stride. Behind him with a short delay was a smaller man, he was clean shaven like a sheep that had sold its wool, and his shoes were sparkling. He looked to be about thirty something, but you never knew someone's real age once they hit thirty. He could be twenty, or he could be forty. She smiled at both men, it was a level two smile, level three was for casuals, and level one was reserved for the big bosses.</p>
<p>“Good morning Lianna, this is William, our new staff member.”</p>
<p>He was a timid person, dressing exactly as Black wanted him to, and following him around obediently. She knew the tour of the workplace would be easy to conduct, maybe she would knock off early. He was quiet and unlikely to complain, she knew why Black hired him.</p>
<p>Black explained to William about the paperwork Lianna would give him, and the tour she would do of the basic places, then he said to send William through to him later.</p>
<p>She gave another level two smile as Black left. It was only her and William here, “How are you doing? Adjusting well?” She gave him a level three smile. They both knew this was smalltalk. </p>
<p>William answered appropriately and she handed him the necessary paperwork, about five forms and a contract sheet. It was 1:40, which meant that she could still catch lunch at two if everything went easily and he didn't ask many questions.</p>
<p>“Okay, let me show you around the area” she was using another level three smile and wiping another bead of sweat, it was really hot today. William nodded and followed along</p>
<p>The time was 1:41:23</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="two-tour">two: tour</h3>
<p>Lianna held out the forms, they were drooping with knowledge and were heavy. She put them down in the corner where things were. Her office had a desk and a chair in it. William stood as she explained the forms, flipping through them, then she took him around the office. They walked past desks, there were six in the main area. One for the executive manager, and two in the middle for accountants. Each accountant had a slightly different job, but Lianna told William that he didn't need to know them. And in the corner behind a blinder was Grace. William saw a younger woman who was slim, she wore glasses and removed her eyes from the computer to greet him.</p>
<p>Behind her, in a cramped area were four people sitting and looking at a computer screen. They were asian and of a completely different culture, they saw William and bowed, “Nice to meet you” a man wearing a vest said, he wore long orange sleeves under a black vest. The others also bowed, and William bowed back. </p>
<p>Lianna led him out through the back door to the administration area and down some steps, she had watched as he bowed to them, he was capable with different cultures. “Now we're at staff dining” she said, there was a small dining area on the edge of the kitchen. Chefs in white hats were running around inside, like they were all looking for a headless chicken. A few people sat at the tables eating quietly, talking normally.</p>
<p>Lianna tried to remember the times for staff dining, she didn't eat here much anymore, the food was  as foul as lipstick. “Breakfast is from 7 to 9, lunch is from...11 to 13.00, and dinner is from 5 to 7.” William got it instantly, they moved through the staff accomodation, he saw one girl sitting outside on the floor, she was trying to use the Wifi, but she could only use it from outside the doorway, so was lying on the ground and trying to use it.</p>
<p>Paua watched Lianna walk past with a new staff member, she had her phone out, and her hair wasn't done. The new person was handsome, and he looked about her age as well. She wondered where he would be working.</p>
<p>Everyone watched each other all the time, people came and went from everywhere. William would soon learn that.</p>
<p>They walked through more, “This is staff area one, and that is staff area three, your room is here, in room four staff area two.”</p>
<p>She gave William the key and he unlocked the door, it was a single room, with a small closet and a single bed. There was a sink in the corner. Public bathrooms were outside. “Thank you” he said, “I can't believe I finally get to have my own room”</p>
<p>Lianna led him to the washing machines next to the lounge, and then to the lounge itself, this was where free internet could be used, a connection to the outside world. Any other internet had to be paid for. She saw that William was happy with it, it seemed like he was easily pleased. Which probably meant that he wouldn't come to her with much trouble. He was an easy employee, they were the best.</p>
<p>“So after you've finished everything, could you go back to Black?”</p>
<p>“Where is he?”</p>
<p>“Oh, didn't I tell you, sorry, I'll show you to him” Lianna led him back past the staff dining, through the back entrance of the hotel and into the staff area. They pushed open a door and suddenly everything changed, there were guests and customers everywhere, everyone was doing their own things, every person in uniform was busy and walking back and forth. Name tags riffled everywhere.</p>
<p>“Through there” Lianna pointed to a sign that hung on the far end, over the tops of about a hundred heads, “That's the souvenir shop over there.” </p>
<p>William looked back at the door that Lianna was standing in, she smiled and waved good luck and walked back, the door shut behind her. It had the words Staff Only written across in clear white letters. It was the boundary between the front and back of the hotel. William had a piece of paper that had his name printed on it, and that was why he was allowed into the hotel, and to be recognized by everyone.</p>
<p>He walked to the store and Black greeted him. “Welcome, how was the tour?”</p>
<p>It was great fun. He nodded. Black was standing behind the counter warmly, watching for customers and for people doing things, and for his staff. There were two other women here, both were busy with things right now, but Black told William to wait for them, eventually they would be able to help him. He went to the back to write some emails.</p>
<p>William stood around as things started to change, and he began to feel the world of the store, customers coming and going, and all of the items here, their prices. One of the women freed herself and introduced herself, she was a quiet fragile lady with black pants. Her name was Jeena, and she was one of the supervisors. “Let me get you your uniform” she led him to the back, there was another code here which she thumbed in, the door opened and William was overwhelmed by the smell of fresh stock for the store. It was plastics, polyestyrene, and all sorts of rubber jammed into this room, row by row. </p>
<p>Jeena was from overseas, William couldn't pinpoint from where, but he knew that for her, this place probably felt like home, She scouted through the rows and found a rack of clothing, she handed him one with a vest. “Bring it tomorrow” she said, “And you have black pants with you?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“How about black shoes, with no patterns on them?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“Okay, bring them tomorrow to work, Black told me that you're coming in tomorrow at seven thirty, but maybe seven fifteen is better”</p>
<p>William was overwhelmed, because he had never woken up at seven fifteen before, he had woken up at seven thirty, or at seven, but not at seven fifteen. This was a whole new experience. And he was excited, he loved new experiences.</p>
<p>“All good?” Jeena said, “You're fine for tomorrow?”</p>
<p>After William left, the other woman had also freed herself from customers, she was the other supervisor, Emilie, and wanted to know what was happening. She was actually the one who would be training him tomorrow and didn't want to miss out on anything.</p>
<p>“He's quiet, but polite, the opposite of you” Jeena said, “He speaks three languages, that's why he was hired”</p>
<p>Emilie spoke three as well, but two of them were deemed useless here. She felt a tinge of jealousy soak her heart, but squeezed it out by organizing more paperwork. She was curious to know what kind of person this William would be, and it made her a bit nervous to be training him tomorrow. What if they didn't get along, or what if she couldn't explain things to him properly. She mentally went over all the things she would teach him tomorrow.</p>
<p>No one recognized it yet, but here was the one who would be bringing a whole lot of trouble with him soon.</p>
<p>Thanks:</p>
<p>What do you feel about Emilie, the supervisor, do you like her or dislike her? Or do you think the whole part about the jealousy is unneccessary and better left out? Would it be better if she were a more positive character?
And what do you think is going to happen next? Can you see what kind of story it is going to become?
Does the writing have enough character, like is there a drive pushing it dforward, or does it feel stagnant and a bit boring?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="three-getting-a-feed">three: getting a feed</h3>
<p>The staff dining was packed full when William walked in. He tried out the food and put it back, it didn't taste good, he pushed his plate to the side and tried out the dessert, it tasted like sugar. He looked around and ate some cereal. Then he looked around and noticed all the different uniforms. There were those members wearing grey uniforms for housekeeping. They were boring like wallpaper that strapped onto them.There were no buttons, it was a simple slip on and off affair. The restaurant staff were all sitting together, they had a dark red striped shirt with long sleeves, they all joked about something that happened at work.</p>
<p>The door swung open and the housekeepers all went out, chattering about something. They had a short dinner break. Then Jeena walked in, she smiled and sat opposite William.</p>
<p>“How are you adjusting?” she smiled and started eating. It seemed like she was a vegetarian, there was no meat there and everything was bushy. </p>
<p>“I'm just enjoying it” he said, “I've never been in a hotel before, like this at the back watching everything unfold”</p>
<p>She shrugged, “Oh, you'll get used to it, and all the people here, soon you will know everyone” When she said it her eyes glowed, as if it was some surprise waiting to be unwrapped.</p>
<p>He noticed she was wearing a light blue uniform with a black vest over top. A few ladies walked in and sat around us, like they were filling a box. They wore suits with striped white shirts on the inside. “Hello are you new?” they said to William. And Jeena filled them in on who he was and what he was going to be doing.</p>
<p>Jeena didnt' say so, but she wondered why she had to do all the talking for him, he could speak for  himself right? She looked at him, he watched her as she talked, and she tried to stop, but then the reception girls wanted to know more, and she had to say more about him.</p>
<p>But she didn't know much more.</p>
<p>William wasn't embarrassed, all these girls were pretty in their suits. He looked at one woman more than a little, she noticed and stopped looking back. He wanted these women. </p>
<p>He didn't say anything, and the women found him mysterious. “What are you here for?” one of them asked. Her fingernails were trimmed beautifully, she was typing and on the phone all day. And her lipstick was the colour of the silver moon.</p>
<p>Dina leaned forward, putting her fork down horizontally across the plate. “What languages do you know, are you fluent? I heard you know quite a few”</p>
<p>“He knows Chinese and Japanese and English and Python” Jeena said. </p>
<p>“I was asking him” Dina said, “Sorry, I don't mean to be rude Jeena, it's just that I want to hear him speak. You can speak right?”</p>
<p>William had his hands clenched into fists, he rested his chin against them, smiling. The receptionists looked at each other, this man was strange, he didn't speak, and he had quite a history that they had all heard about. Dina didn't like him, she changed the topic to something else, but her friend Annalise was fascinated by him, She found him mysterious and uncanny. Why didn't he speak? Where did he come from? What did he do? And what did his voice sound like?”</p>
<p>And he didn't even look at her, no matter how hard she stared. After a while he got up and emptied his plate. He had hardly touched it either, she tried to be discreet but watched as he walked past and pushed the door open and walked out.</p>
<p>“Pshht, what're you looking at, you've got a boyfriend” Dina caught sight of her friend watching, “He's weird, he was acting like he was better than us, like we're not worth talking to or something.”</p>
<p>Jeena looked at her friends, helpless, “I'm sure he's not that bad, he's just shy because there's so many new people” She didn't want her department to look bad, besides they should give him a chance, it was just a first impression gone wrong, he was probably actually a really sweet guy...although she couldn't imagine it herself.</p>
<p>Dina looked like she was from India or Pakistan, but it turned out she was from a Pacific Island. Her skintone was like that. And Annalise wondered if William cared, did he care where they were from, or what their jobs were like, or that she had a busy day today and this was the first break she had since the morning. What was going through his head?</p>
<p>The reception girls stood up, as they stood up a porter sat down, and a new group of Food &amp; Bev staff came to sit down in their wake.</p>
<p>Most of the people wearing the same uniform sat together, work was an integral part of how they bonded, they spent a lot of time working, so this was how topics of commonalities arose. Since the same faces were always seen, familiarity was a guarantee. Like this a small community developed in this isolated location, the staff of the Management became a whole unit that moved as one. They worked coherently backstage to organize events smoothly, so that the front of the hotel looked flawless and without any problems. Everyone knew what they were doing. After everyone had left, the table had lively scraps of food, the spoons still sank into the mashed potatoes and meat that had been dinner, and beside a stack of plates with brown steak sauce smeared over them was a tray soaked in bubble water with the ends of forks and knives poking out. Beyond this, a chef laid had pots and pans in line for the washer, his sleeves were rolled up and he wore a hat to hide his head that had gone bald from chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Posters hung around the room, the chairs were misaligned, all sorts of leaving marks. One poster was two months old, about the upcoming big rugby event that they would all see, and there was a clock on the wall, collaged with all of the other clocks in the hotel. It had a plastic frame, and the seconds hand trembled at the end of every movement like it had Parkinson's. A single light shone down on everything, it was surprisingly bright, and no one ever noticed it.</p>
<p>The door opened and William walked in, he pushed past a row of chairs and walked to the end, he had forgotten to get a cup of water, He heated it in the microwave and sat down in a far chair facing the door, with his arms around it, sitting still.</p>
<p>The kitchen side door opened, a Nero entered. he wore a white uniform with a hat, and was one of the commis chefs. He came out for a ten minute break and noticed a new guy sitting there, in the seat he usually took. Nero loaded his cup with the goods and sat down on the other side, also hugging the cup and staring into space.</p>
<p>Two minutes later William got up and went to work. He went back to his room and dressed in his uniform. He looked in the mirror and fiddled with things until he looked amazing, then he went to work.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="four-store">four: store</h3>
<p>The store clock was still slanted, Black had to slant his head to read it properly, but William was definitely late, four minutes so. Black was planning the reprimand to offer his employee when William walked in, he wasn't in a rush, which made Black cringe, and he didn't look sorry, which made him want to vomit.</p>
<p>“So, glad to see you made it” Black smiled, then stopped “You're four minutes late”</p>
<p>“I'm not” William uncovered his watch in Black's face. Black leaned back, “Your time is wrong, you could have changed it just now to fool me, so I can't look at that time, that's why I look at this time here. When I say you arrive at 8, you need to be here by eight, understood, William?”</p>
<p>William nodded, he had suddenly become timid again. He didn't know what he was feeling, was it rebelliousness, a passive protest; or was it dissatisfaction?</p>
<p>Black had to put a firm foot down on employees with lazy attitudes, the earlier the better. “Don't you dare be late tomorrow, when you come in tomorrow, I've got a lot of things planned for you to do.”</p>
<p>William didn't want to think it, but he didn't like Black. Just a bit, but he just hoped that this feeling woudln't grow. He tried to see the best of it, how his boss was actually very punctual, which was a quality to be respected, and how he was very organized, and things got done because of it.</p>
<p>“Do you have any questions?” Black said, he indicated for Emilie to come, and she came promptly, she had been watching carefully from her job the whole time. “Because Emilie is one of the supervisors with Jeena, she's going to train you for these two weeks, and then you'll start to get the hang of things around here.</p>
<p>William just nodded, he adjusted his collar and his shirt. His vest had his namebadge, it reflected the bright tube lights from the store, his name was printed in small friendly black letters. William thought his whole appearance looked like a cuddly teddy bear or something, it wasn't how he wanted to be.</p>
<p>Of course, Black was there to judge him, he stood approachably, in case a customer came over at any time, and he spoke loud enough to be heard, but not too loud for customers to hear.</p>
<p>“You look good, I now know that you've obviously read the handbook, you've shaved, and your hair is cut short, that's good, but I need you to know that it's not enough, you have to have a good attitude in front of the customers, they are our first priority”</p>
<p>His talking sounded like a shower, William already knew what he was going to be told, just like he knew where the water would go in a shower. He was clean now, there was no need to talk to him like he was a bad person or a person who was only causing problems.</p>
<p>Black retreated to the back of the store and did management work. Emilie spent the rest of the time with William going through the basic procedures of the store, and the little nitpicky things that he shouldn't do because Black didn't like them. William was a fast learner and grasped everything quickly, Emilie only needed to say it once.</p>
<p>She asked him if he had any questions, she had been talking for half the day, she was sure she hadn't explained some things properly, or maybe had missed out something vital. But William asked about the size of the store and how many things they had in it. He even asked the size of the store room at the back, and she was dumbfounded for an answer.</p>
<p>No one had ever asked her these questions. Were they in the manual? Had she missed them? Did he get the things he told her and was bored? Or had he not gotten anything at all...she was at an impasse. She went to do some supervisor work, a stock take sheet, Then when she looked back she saw William asking Jeena some more questions. </p>
<p>He was like a child, as soon as she turned her head she saw him asking questions to anyone in the store. When he had first come in he was a quiet and shy person, but now she saw him talking to everyone. He said anything and asked anything, and it could be a question about anything, something completely random, or something entirely related. Something that she had repeated many times, or something that she hadn't even thought of herself. </p>
<p>As Emilie counted the items in the store and recorded them on a sheet, customers walked past. They  only saw a normal woman in a retail store, boredly writing numbers in her sheet. It was a scene they had seen many times, nothing special. But as so many others are thinking of different things while doing mundane activities, Emilie was thinking about William, she found him really different, and her first impression of him was different as well. Was he a shy person? Or was he just disinterested? She had never quite met anyone like him before.</p>
<p>And then she wondered what he thought of her, had he met anyone like her before?</p>
<p>An elderly Indian couple walked past the rack selling new clothing, they were all souvenir items for the hotel, the woman had curly white hair, and she upturned a lot of clothing as she passed, like a strong wind was making everything flutter out of place. Her husband felt bad and walked behind her rearranging everything.</p>
<p>Then his wife found an item she liked, she went to the closest employee to ask for the price. It was a woman writing and filling out a form. “Excuse me” she leaned over and tapped the woman on the shoulder “How much is this?”</p>
<p>The woman stood up and put the paper away neatly, folding it into quarters. Her namebadge said 'Emilie' “Emilie, how much does this cost, and is it new? Will I be able to take it back to my home country?”</p>
<p>the store person answered every question and met every expectation, she even went beyond and told that lady which one would suit her better and which one worse.Then the Indian lady's husband came oevr and inspected the garment, then inspected this woman, 'Emilie'. She was a nice person, were all other people with this name also nice people?</p>
<p>“How much do you get paid?” the Indian woman said, “In my country, you cannot pay a person enough money to make them talk so politely, and be so friendly, it's a wonderful thing you're doing here.” She raised the garment, “Would you ever be able to buy this?”</p>
<p>“Don't ask the lady that, this is a rude question” Her husband interjected.</p>
<p>“I would have to work a very long time to be able to buy that and still do the other things I want to do” she said. </p>
<p>The Indian woman turned to her husband, “See, I told you that it's expensive here, you should ask for a bargain, this friendly lady can't afford it too.”</p>
<p>William, as usual, was curious and watching. The Indian lady brought the garment to the counter where he folded it. </p>
<p>“Nah uh” she pointed to Emilie, “She can do it, for us, she knows what we want, we told her already” she nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>Emilie rushed over and politely helped the couple out, they left feeling satisfied and that the store had exceeded their expectations. They were sure to tell everyone else about their experience here. Emilie wasn't doing it to set an example, and she didn't want to upstage her colleagues, she only did it because it was the right thing to do. To treat other human beings as proper people, and not as commoditied and wallets. </p>
<p>Usually in stores, people were wallets. In bars, people became sexual objects; and then on telephones people became voices. Lecturers were walking blocks of knowledge, the young and old people became records of time. </p>
<p>Emilie checked the time, it was 10:01, and it wasn't busy now, so she sent William for a ten minute break. He would return when there were more customers.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="five-charlotte">five: charlotte</h3>
<p>Charlotte was polishing the utensils, she had a short break and went out into staff dining for a coffee. She untied her apron and let it hang off her shoulders. She forgot to tie her hair this morning, so was going to do it out there. Anyway coffee was the most urgent. She drew open the kitchen and walked into the staff dining area. She was wearing the maroon restaurant uniform, and she was so tired of watching forks and knives and different shaped spoons pass through her fingers, from one side to another</p>
<p>In staff dining there was one other person, he sat still and stared out of the window. She didn't recognize him, which meant that he was probably new staff. He was quiet, wearing the uniform of the store. She talked to him and things, but didn't respond very warmly.</p>
<p>She sat two seats over from him, far enough not to make it a big deal, but close enough to keep a conversation going. His name badge said William, but she wanted him to tell her his name. So she thought about what to say. She wanted him to know who she was, to remember her.</p>
<p>But she didn't need to, he spoke up first, his voice was quiet and withdrawn, like he was telling her a secret that only she was supposed to hear. “Hi, nice to meet you, my name is William” he said, “I just started working in the store”</p>
<p>He spoke like it wasn't a big deal, like he was used to doing it. Not many guys were as straightforward about it as he was. And then he started asking her questions, before she even introduced herself.</p>
<p>“So, Charlotte, what time did you start working today?”</p>
<p>Charlotte started her spiel, “I started work at five am, and now I've got just three more hours until I finish.”</p>
<p>“And what are you going to do after you finish?” he said. </p>
<p>“I'm going to watch a movie” she said, “And sleep, then when I wake up my boyfriend's going to call me” The detail about her boyfriend was exaggerated, actually he was a boy she had met a week ago out of town who had asked for her number, but she wasn't interested in him. She was surprised at what she was saying as well.</p>
<p>But William wasn't surprised, he nodded, seriously listening to what she had to say. Charlotte wondered if she lied more would he still listen as attentively?</p>
<p>“How do you enjoy work, any guys you like?” he said, and she got upset, not visibly so, but she felt like it was too sudden. Especially after she had been lying.</p>
<p>“I just met you” she said, “I don't know if I can be telling you all about my personal life, I think you need to back off a bit”</p>
<p>William's eyebrows raised, he sat straight, “Oh sorry, I never meant it like that, I swear. I was just curious”</p>
<p>His innocence made her laugh. And William wondered why this girl was suddenly laughing about everything he had to say. He noticed the reception girl looking this way, eyeing the both of them talking, she looked like she wanted to say something.  And he noticed the time running on the clock. It was almost ten minutes, and he knew that over here the time never waited for anyone.</p>
<p>He stood up because he had to go, Charlotte and William promised to talk to each other again. </p>
<p>Charlotte found herself becoming curious about him. She watched as he walked out. He had been asking her questions, but she never asked him anything. Did that mean that he didn't care what she thought of him? But she was happy to make another friend.</p>
<p>Suddenly William came walking back in, she was still sitting in the same position, with her legs crossed, still facing where he had been. Then he walked in and straight to her, he was in a rush and left no time to guessing.</p>
<p>“Charlotte” he said, he was smiling now. “Do you want to meet up tonight?”</p>
<p>It was all so sudden, what did he mean by 'meet up'? The phrase had so many connotations that she couldnt' be sure, was it something casual, or was it something really serious? If it was something serious then could she handle it?</p>
<p>“I live in Staff number one, room five” his eyes were sparkling like the plates she had been polishing for the past two hours, “Come over and knock any time, and we can talk or something, I feel like we might get along”</p>
<p>Charlotte was blinking like an idiot, and she told herself to stop blinking in front of William like a broken traffic light. </p>
<p>“Sure” she said, “I'll come over” She couldn't believe the words coming out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it, I'll see you later then” William looked glad, and he was genuinely glad.</p>
<p>She couldn't believe it, how come she was doing something so rash and uncalculated, she wasn't like this. She had only met him for ten minutes and had agreed to go to his room. Charlotte, you're too boy hungry, you need to calm down, you've been with many guys before, you should know not to dive at the first guy you see. Besides, you can get better meals.</p>
<p>When William got back from his ten minute break Emilie was upset, in those ten minutes a hectic-whole-lot had happened, but of course William didn't know about it. He had messed up the register, put the wrong amount of money through, and even talked to others about things happening. He wasn't doing a good job, she could tell from the moment he walked in that he wasn't doing a very good job. She just couldn't tell if it was because he didn't enjoy it, or because he just didn't know how.</p>
<p>Now Emilie was confused, because she had trained many others before, but all of them seemed a lot more capable than this new person. She asked William to go and do the vacuuming of the store, she pointed out to him where all of the power plugs were, and she told him how it should look afterwards. While he did that she would plan a strategy of attack to help him learn the technical things on how to book trips for people and how to talk to customers.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, William went to the edge of the store and it started beeping, the vacuum was not allowed to be taken out of the store. Emilie looked over, her face was apinted with rage, but she pulled it apart and reassembled a concerned and happy face. William looked up to see her caring face. “You can use that plug” Emilie pointed to one other plug, she even physically went over to the stall to show him where it was. Then the vacuum won't go through the gates and it won't beep. Okay?” She smiled, and he nodded and thanked her. It was the plug where everything in the store was powered from.</p>
<p>There was security on all of the items worth more than $10, and the items not worth $10 were a few lollipops and a napkin with the pattern of the New Zealand Kiwi on it. So everything else would beep if it was taken through. It had to be deactivated at the counter.</p>
<p>William was taught how to count the money at the counter, it was checked twice a day. In the morning a float of either $150 or $300 dollars was placed inside and the total cash was counted back to front. At the end of the day they counted everything, the extra cash and the float, and took it to reception to be double counted. </p>
<p>William stood with the bag of money in front of reception, the receptionists counted it. Up came a sophisticated looking man who had shaved every last hair off the front of his face to the forefront. His chest hair was out of control, it looked like a wrestling match. His shirt was ironed smooth and white like cream cheese, and his pants were black with subtle vertical stripes. His fingers moved the exact amount to let the cash slip, he didn't miss a single one. He finished counting it and wrote the number of notes down. He didn't see William, he didn't see anything happening around him, only the money, his fingers, and the cumulative result.</p>
<p>Emilie stood beside him, she was tapping her fingers on the reception desk impatiently. They still had to get a lot done before the day finished. Especially with the innate talent of this genius next to her, they would be lucky if they were done by midnight.</p>
<p>Gerry finished counting the money and looked up for the first time at these two. Emilie was here, as usual she was eager to leave, he already felt sorry for the new guy who had to be trained by her. It was just his theory, but whoever was trained by Emilie became a little crooked, some part of them just became messed up, he didn't know if it was her, or if it was the job, but it became like that. It was one of those facts of life, like most women were insecure about appearances, and most men were egoistic jerks, and most children observed the world like it was SKY TV or some sh** like that, or that people who sang while they showered were avid talkers. This was just another one of those stupid meaningless facts that he had realized in life, just like a lump sticking out of the side of  your body, this was just like that.</p>
<p>The money was right, Gerry signed the form and Emilie signed her portion. “Thank you Gerry” Emilie said, she spoke more out of formality than anything else. Then she disappeared, as if suddenly upset by something, she needed time alone to sort out everything.</p>
<p>“What's up with her?” Gerry looked over the counter to where Emilie was walking off. “She suddenly is in a bad mood”</p>
<p>“It's a woman thing” A receptionist came from behind Gerry, she was also wearing the same white shirt, and a smooth looking suit. William recognized her as Dina, her hair was settled neatly, and her  eyes looked at the computer screen. She put three folders down on the table and started typing.</p>
<p>“What's a woman thing?” William said, </p>
<p>“Sometimes you just feel so much stress, you don't want to talk to anyone, just need to get a few minutes to yourself” Behind Dina, Annalise walked out. She wasn't carrying any folders, her hands were free. She bent over the desk, leaning over close enough to smell the money.</p>
<p>“How's your first day?” she said. “Meeting many people?”</p>
<p>“You know” Gerry said it emotionlessly, “If just now the forms I gave her were marriage papers, she would have signed them the same way, quickly and peacelessly”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?” Gerry was always thinking about marrying one of these girls around him. Then he could have as much sex and talk as much smack as he liked, and it was allowed, because they were married. He once had a girlfriend who begged him to give it to her, and they were long distance, but he still drove three hours across the country to go and service her. He thought about her whenever he felt like no one needed him.</p>
<p>Annalisa rolled her eyes, “You're hitting on the new guys again” </p>
<p>Gerry looked at William to see how he was reacting, “She does this to everyone” </p>
<p>“No, you're hitting on the new guys” If Annalise was offended she didn't show it, but she ignored Gerry and spoke while looking at William. “No, I do this all the time, I'm curious of what people think of us...”</p>
<p>“Us...as in, we're weird?”</p>
<p>“No, no, I'm just curious about new people all the time” she said. “Besides, I'm protecting you from this baldie over here”</p>
<p>“Okay, stop talking” Gerry laughed, “You're just digging yourself deeper, it's so obvious you're hitting on William, even Gandhi knows it”</p>
<p>“The last time Gerry said anything productive was in 1962, and it was a life changing event” Dina said. She looked like she was focused on the computer screen, but was talking to us, her cheeks and nose had the pale light of the screen reflected on them like a full moon. It was near the end of the day and all of them were nearly able to rest. Then all the casual talk came out. Annalise and Dina could go on forever about work. And William didn't mind watching them because they were attractive.
    Gerry was surrounded mostly by women in reception, and most of the time it was good. But sometimes he didn't enjoy it, and this was one of those times. They ganged up and said things about him that made him uncomfortable, it was gender harrassment. So he just counted the floats, it initially began like that, and now he was doing it every night. The work was easy, yet important because everyone relied on him to do it. Also, he found that he was good at it, genuinely good, so that he had found some small passion to fill his big life. He counted the floats from the store, as well as from the restaurant, for the breakfast and lunch and dinner. And then for the cafe upstairs, and then for the bar as well. And when he was done counting them others appreciated his efforts. </p>
<p>On the other hand, he had five fingers. He knew what people said about him, he was antisocial and difficult to talk to, he had the type body odour that didn't exactly make the ladies run towards him. And they probably didn't like him much. So when he counted floats he was able to ignore their inquisitions. </p>
<p>After William left, he knew there would be some tension between all of them, because everyone was doing different things, and everyone had different ways of doing the same thing. Some employees did it faster, some did it slower, some did it freely with distractions, some were completely focused and finished it perfectly. </p>
<p>William was still standing around watching while Gerry put the money away into the safe. He was strangely curious. Dina and Annalise were finishing up the day's duties, and William was finished as well, but he stayed to persistently ask questions. “Where do you put the money?”</p>
<p>“In the safe” Gerry said. Dina and Annalise were quietly starting a conversation about the length of their hair, and whether short hair looked better with lighter colors or not. There was nothing new there. “There are five security cameras, and they all link to the head of security, and the boss as well.” Gerry explained it matter of factly, like he had thought about it a lot.And he liked explaining things in the presence of Annalise and Dina.</p>
<p>“So if anything happens to the money...”</p>
<p>“You won't even get out the door.” Gerry looked over, he knew the girls were going to hear every word he said, he didn't care about looking good in front of them. “Are you thinking of taking it?” But he wanted them to admire him at least. “It's a one way street for forty five minutes out, and then it's a two way street out. It's practially a dead end to get out of here.”</p>
<p>The girls looked over, why was this new guy asking about the safe? Was he weird or was he just plain stupid. It wasn't the first time someone thought about William in this way, and he was used to it. He knew the stares he was getting weren't attractions.</p>
<p>“I'm just curious” he didn't tell them he had never seen such a big safe. But he knew the combination was stored somewhere, maybe inside another safe. That was how it usually worked.</p>
<p>Gerry made William sign a form about the money, confirming how much he brought in and how much of it was the float. Once the numbers on both sides were complete they signed it off to store it away. “Now go back, I bet Emilie's waiting on you”</p>
<p>As soon as William was gone, Dina and Annalise started talking about him, as if the back of his head had sparked their conversation. They talked about his asian heritage and about his lifestyle, about his height, and about his accent. They talked about everything but him. Then Gerry knew everything, even about what kind of food William may like, and what kind of food he probably won't touch, and by food, it meant girls. And by girls, it meant everything.</p>
<p>As soon as Annalise was gone, Dina went up to Gerry. “You were so quiet just now” she said, “Why?” As if it was in her right for him to reply to every question she asked.</p>
<p>The way she asked 'why' really demanded an answer, “I wasn't quiet” Gerry put the money in, making sure to lock it back up. The safe was so thick that even a criminal couldn't open it with a drill. And if criminals were to assault them, it would be safer to personally hide in the safe than anywhere else. He had heard of criminals who had stolen whole safes before and then realized while they were running away that there was a person inside the safe, and not money. Then he started to imagine what that person inside the safe must have felt like. </p>
<p>Like money probably. </p>
<p>And the joke was that people were supposed to be priceless, more important than money.</p>
<p>“You were so quiet, like you were shy, or offended” Dina went on. “Why don't you talk?”</p>
<p>Gerry sighed, here they started again, Dina tried to talk about everything and make it an argument and he was sick of it. How did she manage to see so much negativity in everything? “I was just counting the float, okay?”</p>
<p>Dina crossed her arms and came even closer, they had the same job and had been here for about the same amount of time, yet she had more authority than him. “Every time you think you're so perfect at your job, and then one of us, Annalise or I has to do something that shows you you're wrong, then you suddenly become quiet and shut up like a clam. I guess that's just you. Always making us retract your tail.”</p>
<p>Gerry was upset, but he didn't show it, it wasn't worth it. He just nodded silently and passive-agressively.</p>
<p>Back at the shop, fifteen metres away, Emilie was waiting, she had counted up three more things to go through to train William on. “You really enjoy talking to people don't you?” she said, her arms were crossed, she meant that he had taken longer than she expected him to. </p>
<p>“Oh, was I supposed to come back here right away?”</p>
<p>She heaved out her chest and sighed, William thought she looked really attractive for a second but shook that thought out of his conscience. “No, not really, just that we have a lot to get done.” By the time she had moved around to write something, the moment had gone and she had become someone else. When he finished with the money, he wrote his sign out sheet. Then he said bye to his supervisor Emilie. She waved bye and said that she had something to finish, she just had to check the rest of the money.</p>
<p>William walked out of the store, a chain had been drawn across to indicate closure. He went past reception and through the 'staff only' doors. It was a heavy door, always comfortable to swing. Then he turned a corner and was outside. The air was cold and piercing. A refreshing change from inside the shop. It was interesting how one door with one label stopped all of the hotel guests from going through, just a few words to filter out the employees from the guests.</p>
<p>“You're not going to say hi to me?”</p>
<p>He saw a figure in the shadows, she was sitting on the bench smoking. She saw him and threw the smoke down and quenched it with her feet, smudging a minute diagonal trail on the bricks underfoot. He saw the glare of the cigarette fall onto the ground.</p>
<p>“It's a great night for pregnant women” he said.</p>
<p>“What?” Charlotte gaped with her mouth, “What have you been smoking, are you trying to be funny, or are you trying to creep me out? I was waiting for you okay?” Charlotte had been waiting here for a while and she wasn't one to wait, it was usually the other way around.  Her face was dark against the sky, the cigarette she held in her fingers looked like a dagger, her legs were in the shape of the Southern Cross. She didn't know why she had been waiting for him, but time had passed quickly.</p>
<p>William walked off, he took a few steps and turned around to see Charlotte unmoving. “Are you coming?” </p>
<p>Charlotte scowled and made an eagle sound. He didn't greet her or show any awareness of her presence, he didn't have any basic manners. And he didn't care that she was here waiting. Why did he want her to follow him? She didn't know why she followed him.</p>
<p>William led this girl to his room, he stood in front of the door, the two of them were talking in the corridor and waking everyone up. Charlotte kept complaining about how his hair looked like her ex boyfriend that she hated. “You need to cut it” she had become a monster through the night, she wasn't smiling and cheery anymore. She liked to think it was the cigarettes. </p>
<p>“Get lost, it's none of your business” William was looking for his key. “you don't even know me, why are you acting like this, you're insane” They were in the hallway, William digging through his pockets for they key, and Charlotte leaning over his shoulders and the door handle, saying rude things about him loud enough for the whole village to hear. William knew he needed to release her stress, she was complaining because she wanted it.</p>
<p>William finally found his key and unlocked the door. Then Charlotte stole it out of his hands and slipped it into her chest, her fingers dug around until she slipped the key into her bra. “I bet you can't find it now” she grinned.</p>
<p>William laughed, he didn't care, the door was open. He pulled Charlotte's hand and threw her in the room. “Do you want your key back?” she said. “It's mine now” she laughed and shook her hair loose. She had showered up and had perfume in strategic spots on her body. Her jeans were tight fitting, and her shirt was tiny, her belly button said hi whenever she leaned back.</p>
<p>“So...what do you want me here for?” William had sat down on the bed next to her and was staring at her intently. She looked around the room, the desk was empty except for a few pieces of paper, there was a computer and a sink. A backpack was in the cupboard, tied to the floor, and all of the clothes were folded like dominoes. She knew if she pulled one of them they would all come loose. She knew William was a tidy guy, a rare breed in the hospitality industry. But then she noticed all of the water bottles lined against the window. There were seventeen bottles all equidistant, and his two pairs of shoes sat perfectly side by side, facing West, towards the big scenic reserve outside.</p>
<p>“Do you have OCD?” she said as a joke.</p>
<p>William didn't answer, then it became awkward, so she changed the topic, she learned more about him. “So, what did you invite me here for? You want to discuss the nature or what?”</p>
<p>They had sex, it lasted about four and a half minutes, William was probably more satisfied than she was. In four and a half minutes he could have served three customers at the desk and still completed a till check.</p>
<p>They were both in bed, William ran his hands up and down her body, she felt smooth like an apple from a tree. Charlotte had been so talkative the whole time, but after they finished, she fell silent. She didn't know why either, but after a while it became apparent that she wasn't talking. She felt like she didn't know much about William. </p>
<p>But they had done it now. She turned in the bed and looked at William, he had his arms under his head and was looking up at the ceiling. She turned to look, but got bored of staring at nothing, then she turned back to him. What did he feel about all of this, she was crazy to go this far with someone she hardly knew.</p>
<p>“You can f*** off now” William said. </p>
<p>Charlotte gaped again, “Are you serious right now?”</p>
<p>“Nah, whatever” William sat up, “I've got work to do”</p>
<p>Charlotte slapped William, his head twisted back and she recoiled off the bed. She stood up and found her clothes. The key was on the floor and she put it back in her bra. Then she slid her underwear on and more and more clothes. William was staring at her. “Was I good?” he sounded sad, and she was angry, so she ignored him. “I'm taking your key, next time you can come and apologize to me”</p>
<p>William stood up and got dressed, he smoothed out the covers where she had been. They were still warm and he was smoothing her over. “You don't care about me do you?” she said. She left, because he was becoming so cold and difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>As she walked back to her room, she looked at the time on her mobile phone, the screen shone bright and ate up the darkness. 10:15 it glowed. Then she rustled her hair like it was the leaves of a tree. She stopped in her steps and leaned against the corridor wall. Five minutes ago everything would have been different and they would still be in there, things happened so suddenly. Just a few pumps from William and he was finished. It wasn't even good, but more than that, she was hurt that he didn't care. She was just another walking vagina to him.</p>
<p>She shivered in disgust, her hand moved to her bra, she felt the cold metal of the key impressed on her chest like a tattoo. Then she went on back to her room. She bet that William had never seen her Tattoos, she had one on her back, of a knife piercing into her body, and another one by her</p>
<p>Then next moment she heard knocking on her door. She opened it and saw William, full of expression again. His hand was still in the knocking motion, </p>
<p>“I don't like my job” he said.</p>
<p>And they both stared at each other.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="six-misty">six: misty</h3>
<p>Misty stood against her window, there was loud music next to her and it was keeping her awake. Now, more and more often, she found herself dreaming of home. She was twenty two this year, and twenty two times more likely to be homesick. Her work started at night, but she spent the past two and a half hours lying in bed. This wasn't like her because all through school she had been working hard and furthering herself, and then she went to University, and there she made a lot of friends and furthered herself even more with never a moment to spare in bed staring into space. </p>
<p>Maybe she was making up for it all now. Like they say, if you smell all of the flowers in the world you're bound to run out of flowers of that smell. The reason why there were no more petals was because everyone had been making so many decisions recently.</p>
<p>She brought the covers over her head, drowning out the music. How could people be so inconsiderate, it wasn't just them living here. She decided to think about herself. Her legs snuggled closely together like a pair of twins who only knew each other. What was wrong with her? How come she felt so tired all the time, she couldn't do anything productive, everyday she had to sleep for twelve hours to feel rejuvenated. She had no friends here, no one who she really enjoyed talking to. Then by habit she checked her watch and groaned, in an hour she would have to go to work. It was three p.m. Tonight she would be finishing at midnight.</p>
<p>“Where did you put my money?”</p>
<p>Her roommate Annalise came in. She had a towel wrapped around her head and some fragrances diffusing off her body. She wasn't wearing much, only a towel, but her earrings were planned.</p>
<p>“Do you like them?” she said, half to the mirror and half to her roommate.</p>
<p>Misty didn't bother groaning, “Okay, before we pretend any more tell me who it is. Ms. Misty, who do you have a crush on this time?</p>
<p>Annalise pretended not to hear her, but it was so obvious that it made Misty laugh. “Come on, you know you're going to tell me sooner or later, so you better tell me now!”</p>
<p>“But there's this new guy in the shop” Annalise seemed embarrassed to say this, “He's really quiet, but he's got this weird aura around him, like mysterious, I have no idea what he's thinking. Dina thinks he's gay.”</p>
<p>Misty was still under the covers, she poked her head out like a tortoise, and Annalise saw her and laughed. “I'm going to pull you out of bed, let's go for a hike or something, then I can tell you all the juicy details.”</p>
<p>“A hike?” They both laughed now, because that was the only outdoor activity they could do here. There were no shops, no social activities, and no people saying anything different. Whenever Annalise came back, Misty felt a lot more energetic and got out of bed. She stared in the mirror and started to feel depressed at how old and tired she looked, Mary Antoinette who had been in her deathbed for two hundred years would still look better than her, and she had gone through the revolution. But Annalise saw this and pulled her friend away from the mirror and spun her around to look outside.</p>
<p>“Juicy details?” They laughed again, because Misty was such a pervert.</p>
<p>“Remember the rule?” she said, “No mirror in the morning, or until you can smile” It was a stupid rule the two of them had made together on a drunk night, but they always repeated it, partly as an inside joke. Partly as a sealing of their friendship, and partly to tell each other that they were both going through the same things in life.</p>
<p>“I have to go to work” Misty said, “Let me check on him for you” </p>
<p>“He's been training for three or four days now” Annalise grinned, “Come back here and tell me everything, what you think of him, and those things.”</p>
<p>“Does he have a girlfriend”</p>
<p>“Oh, and ask him that too” Annalise said, “Thanks sweetie”</p>
<p>Misty sighed, Annalise was so spontaneous, she never liked one guy for longer than her friends were jealous. And every time, she said this was the man for her. She didn't even know the guy's age, he could be seriously messed up and she wouldn't see it. She felt sorry for her friend, she started liking any guy who was new and who treated her like trash. </p>
<p>Then Misty examined her own history, she went through the dates that she had, and the people that she fell for. She started thinking hard. Annalise sat down on her bed and noticed it instantly. “Misty, you need to relax, stop thinking so hard, it doesn't bring anything, that's why you're always lying in bed tired, because you think too much, just live life a little.”</p>
<p>“I know, you don't need to tell me”</p>
<p>“I have told you right? The way you're acting makes me think you never listen.” Annalise was happy to judge her friend until the cows came home, but she couldn't see herself at all. No mirror would do that for her. She was one of those people who gave and gave and never took.</p>
<p>“I just want you to be careful around guys” Misty said, “Especially the ones who are new and dark and tall and handsome, who are also well equipped.” She finally put on her uniform, it took a while because she couldn't talk and dress at the same time. At work she was quiet, not because she wanted to be, but because she was so preoccupied with working. She moved at her own pace, but everyone told her she was fast, and that slowing down would only be good for her.</p>
<p>Annalise sat down on Misty's bed. “What are you saying?” For a while now she had been getting increasingly annoyed at Misty's attitude, she always just went to work and came home, she didnt' live, she just lounged around, then complained about not getting guys, and gave advice to be careful. “You need to get out and see thing some time, right now you're just sitting on your butt, like a refrigerator.”</p>
<p>Misty looked at Annalise, then she went back to her life, she was always like that, she never listened. Both girls had tensions growing about this, they both tried to ride it off, but it was twitching in the background like a tectonic plate curved and ready to snap any second.</p>
<p>“I'm going to work” Misty said, “If you want to, we can talk later” </p>
<p>“I'm asleep at midnight” Annalise said, “But I would like to talk tomorrow” She didn't just want to talk about guy things, and she hoped Misty knew that. She had so much to share, about this new guy that she found interesting, and about work, and about the things that happened in her life. Besides, she wanted to know more about Misty as well.</p>
<p>They used to be closer, when they first moved in. They came a few days apart from each other, and they instantly began talking. But over time Misty had become more quiet and reserved, and it made her uncomfortable to have a roommate who was so quiet about everything. She felt like her friends who had other roommates were a lot better off.</p>
<p>Misty was a thoughtful girl, she thought deeply about things, and later she would find the answer. That was probably her talent. Annalise had not met many people before, but she had also not met anyone who was like Misty. If anything went wrong, she could rely on Misty to solve it.</p>
<p>Misty adjusted her namebadge, then she looked over at Annalise who was sitting on the bed with her legs outstretched. “Okay, I'm going to go now” she nodded, and Annalise smiled back.</p>
<p>When the door was closed, Annalise collapsed on the bed, exhausted. Her head lay in Misty's sheets, they were neatly laid out and smelled of washing powder. Annalise felt a bit lonely, and she wanted to be closer to her roommate. She was such a nice person, and wasn't involved in all the nonsensical chit chat that everyone else seemed to dance to. But she felt so different, her bed was a scrambled mess on her side, and Misty's bed was perfect, it looked like it had been ironed because there wasn't a crease in the fabric.</p>
<p>Outside, Misty walked along the corridor and turned through the staff area into the open, she went past reception by the front of the hotel and into the store. She saw the new staff member there, he was doing a till check. First she saw his appearance, and introduced herself. Emilie waved hi to her.</p>
<p>He hardly looked up, and just nodded. This was a first meeting, he was pretty rude. Misty ignored him and went on to do her work. As she served her first customer, William was still doing the same till check, he was taking a long time. </p>
<p>“Did you know that he doesn't have a degree or anything?” Jeena leaned over and whispered. Everyone knew that Jeena had a postgraduate degree in computer science, but with it she was now working retail. Her dissatisfaction came through in her actions, she wanted to be doing something more important. And hopefully by doing a good job she would be noticed and promoted.</p>
<p>But once she learned that William didn't have a degree or anything, and that he just got the job easily, she got upset. Why did he get to do all of these things without working for it.</p>
<p>Besides, when she greeted him he didn't even respond, what kind of attitude did he have? She went to the back of the store and brought out the rubbish, it was on a trolley, she asked if there was anything more to place on it, Emilie and Jeena both shook their heads. William took some rubbish out of his pocket and reached over and put it in the trolley.</p>
<p>Misty was livid. She was so upset at him, and she didn't know why. But she left it like that and took out the rubbish, to the end she didn't show her real emotion. Misty walked through the entrance and the anti-theft security machines beeped. There were tags that hadnt been cleared yet. But that was okay. William looked up and noticed all of this happening.</p>
<p>“The trolley is okay when Misty does it, she sometimes doesn't clear security tags, it's because she's been here the longest.” Emilie said, then she leaned over to see how William was doing with the till check. </p>
<p>Misty came back and there was no trace of anger on her, she had taken the few minutes to herself and recovered completely. She smiled at all of them and immediately started serving customers. Everyone else was completely oblivious to what she had been thinking about for the past ten minutes.</p>
<p>When William left for the day, he saw how the store was a post office, they sent letters and parcels. They were a store selling goods as well as an acitivty desk, booking the various tourist activities for the hotel.  In the back they had to sort through the mail, as well as run the theatre shows in the museum section at the back. It was a very diverse place to be working.</p>
<p>But William wasn't satisfied, he didn't know why and felt strange about it. Everyone else around him seemed to be in high spirits and doing what they were passionate about. They worked hard and were kind to customers. But William found it harder and harder to keep that facade up.</p>
<p>He kicked a rock on his way home. His legs were tired from working all day, he was paid for it, but he didn't know why he did it. Why did he have to work so hard just to be able to support himself in this life? Why did he have to come to this beautiful place in the world to stay indoors and sell customers things that he didn't care about, at all.</p>
<p>Was this how the world survived? Was this what people in the world did? He wanted something more, but the more he thought about it the more guilty he felt.</p>
<p>He kicked another rock off to the side, everyone was asleep here, some had early morning shifts. And now he felt lonely, he wanted a woman to comfort him.</p>
<p>He pulled his phone out of his pocket and started scrolling through contacts. Who could he ask to meet up with?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="seven-the-lounge">seven: the lounge</h3>
<p>In the staff lounge, after dark, people started talking about different things. Everything became more private and entertaining. Most people were asleep, those who worked late shift or those who had something to say stayed awake. The sun dimmed outside and the lights slowly came on, one by one, the electrical wires conntecting the whole system were malfunctional or lazy, but in the end they came on. A dfew staff members came along and turned on the TV to watch, the volume was far too loud and they browsed Facebook on their phone to get updated with what was happening in the outside world. That was what it felt like, that the rest of the world was somehow disonnected and progressing in a different line, And if they stayed here too long, then they wouldn't be able to get back easily. A lot of the newer staff felt this way, and never really adapted to the location because of it. In general, it probably derived itself from human's need for interconnectivity. William felt this way, although he didn't know why, and a lot of other staff felt this way. It was, because of its naturality, a difficult place to survive.</p>
<p>The first people left, the last person left the TV switched on. One guy was still in the corner with his shoes on the table. He was semi-sleeping, but his senses scoured the room. He sat here every night and peopld didn't bother to greet him.</p>
<p>After about nine o clock, it was late and the first people who had to work early the next morning had gone to bed already. Then footsteps grew closer down the hall and William entered, he was carrying a bag of notebooks. He saw the guy in the corner and sat in the opposite corner, leaning down to read through his books and study.</p>
<p>William felt like talking to someone, about his current lifestyle, his change. It welcomed a conversational mood in him. Only the TV was on, and nobody was watching it, so he got up and turned it off.</p>
<p>Then in five minutes another guy came in and collapsed on the couch, he put his feet up, and his eyes were staring down at his phone. He had a strong presence around him that shouldn't be disturbed. He breathed hard, tired from work, as if he had been running for the past twenty years. His body was toned down and slim, but his eyes were hostile. When William looked at him he suddenly looked away. William shrugged and went back to his corner to do work, this was when things quieted down. He flipped through pages of his computer programmign books, he really wanted to study it. After about twenty minutes he looked up, the guy on the other side was staring at him, he didnt' nod or indicate any interest, he just was staring. His eyes were small and narrowed, as if he were too tired to keep them open. He didn't move his eyes away and got up and started walking over. His steps were salty, and his shoes were shiny. </p>
<p>William looke dup from his shoes to the man in front of him, up close he looked a little older, maybe in his late twenties or early thirties. His lips were dry, he didn't talk much.</p>
<p>“You new here?” He collapsed on the couch. William didn't notice his uniform, it was a normal boring grey.</p>
<p>He didn't budge, he had his fingers fiddling with each other, and his shoes were facing the window. But his eyes kept staring, shamelessly. He looked William up and down, then at his cheeks, and at the books he was reading. “I asked you if you're new here?”</p>
<p>“Yes I am” William was trying not to feel threatened by this guy. Why did he have to come over here and disturb him.</p>
<p>“And you work in the store?” His tone was lackluster.</p>
<p>“Yes” William smiled, “I'm just learning the ropes”</p>
<p>“Do you enjoy it?” What was with all of these questions?</p>
<p>“I don't know, I just started”</p>
<p>The man leaned forward, he removed his legs off the tables and leaned over. Now William could even smell him, he smelled like cleaning product, a can of fish, was this some unique perfume?</p>
<p>“Even if you just started, you can tell if you like a job in two minutes”</p>
<p>“Not really, it takes about a week”</p>
<p>“If you know what you're doing, then you will know, just ask yourself. If you really ask yourself then two minutes is enough, in fact you could have a lot less than that and it would be sufficient. So two minutes is enough, right?”</p>
<p>William sighed, this man was right, he wanted a first impression of the job, not a general overview. “Fine, I don't like it, okay? But it's not so bad, I don't mind doing it.”</p>
<p>The man didnt' look satisfied, he didn't look bored, he just looked like William did in the store, just fulfilling a methodical procedure to come to a planned result.  </p>
<p>“What do you do?”</p>
<p>The man turned around and spoke out loud, “Somebody, please, tell this guy who I am?”</p>
<p>The other guy sitting at his computer responded, as if an alarm had been triggered. “He's Daniel, he works in housekeeping, and he's been there for five years now”</p>
<p>Daniel stared back at William as the guy answered for him. “Thank you” he said when it was finished. “This is my f<strong><em>* housekeeping uniform, and the money I make won't even buy me a pair of sh</em></strong> Louis Vuittons with the red underneath. (He is obsessed about his shoes) You know the ones I'm talking about?”</p>
<p>William was stunned, he didn't know at all. But he realized the smell was housekeeping, and they got paid minimum wage and worked up to ten or twelve hours a day making beds. He felt sorry for them, the grey uniform was more boring than wallpaper, it was supposed to make you blend in, not stand out. But he didn't want to feel pity for this man, he looked too aggressive to deserve pity. He looked cocky as a desk.</p>
<p>“It's the way the world works, I'm another pawn in the whole system, do you know how the system works? Huh, do you?”</p>
<p>It took William a while to realize that Daniel was asking a serious question, he felt the hairs on his chest rise, was Daniel getting angry? “It means we're all a gear in the machine, and the machine has no ghost, right? I got that from a famous thing I watched.”</p>
<p>“We all watch famous things” Daniel said, “It means that at work I can't be myself, I can't say or do what I think, if I kick the bed then my supervisor gets angry at me, because the customer will complain, and then the big boss will hear it and ask questions, there's a whole chain of authority watching over every gear in the system. That's the kind of machine we live in.”</p>
<p>Daniel's face was unchanging, but the way he spoke harbored hatred much bigger than the space he occupied. And he understood it all, he went on to speak all about William's job, the boss, the places he went, and the time he had, it was almost as if he had done the job himself. </p>
<p>“But you're a housekeeper” William said, “How do you know all these things?”</p>
<p>He put two fingers to his eyes and pointed around, “I watch, while I'm working I watch everything around me, while I'm eating I watch as people speak, and when I go to the toilet I think about what people said. My life is a big voyeur, like a reporter, except that I can't write for sh**, and no one is going to listen to a perky dick wearing a wallpaper uniform.” He clenched his fists and moved his legs to the side, his shoes reflected circles of light, they were the color of the lightbulb above them. A dark yellow that had not yet turned orange. His legs were hairy, his pants rolled up and the hairs his thighs looked like a hairdresser had made a big mistake.</p>
<p>“So, the world's not fair” he said, “Big news huh? Housekeeping has so many females, all the females are catty and talk about everything that everyone has said and hasn't said. No one talks more than the housekeepers, because we're bored, we're just a whole lumped up ball of sh<strong>ty boredness that keeps rolling and rolling until it finds something to slam into” He punched his hands together in fists and explode mid-air. “Our boss sits back and reads Women's Weekly while we shove a disgusting sponge up and down a f</strong>*ing disgusting toilet. Sometimes people decide to miss a toilet. That all of the civilization in the world who just happen to have never seen a toilet or used one before get clumped up together in this hotel I will have no idea. While we make bed after bed, guests come in and rip the bed apart and complain that it isn't made properly. Then the boss gets up from her Women's Weekly, she puts on her shoes, because she hardly ever wears them, she shakes her fat butt, and balances it all the way to the complaint. If you take away her Women's Weekly, then she'll have nothing to do, everyone needs breaks of course, so you give them a break here and a break there. So she is at work, reading the magazine, then she goes and takes her break, and goes ot the break room and reads the magazine. If a crime ever occurs and she is involved, then you should just go and get a magazine and check her fingerprints on that. I bet you that if she gets married, she'll be reading a Women's Weekly while putting the bronze ring on.”</p>
<p>“So can't you find something else?” William was both impressed and disgusted by this outburst of from Daniel. He was impressed by the eloquence of it, but disgusted by the message and the negativity involved.</p>
<p>Then Daniel smiled, like he had been waiting for William to ask him this, “Don;t get me wrong, I love my job. There's huge potential in it.” </p>
<p>“Potential? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Daniel leaned in to say something privately, “It's all ears around here, I'll tell you later, I'm assembling a team. Are you interested in making some money?”</p>
<p>“How much are we talking?” William said. “I'm working long hours but maybe I can fit it in”</p>
<p>Daniel was serious, “No, this is the one night stand of jobs, it's a one hit wonder, we're talking a million dollars, each. But it has the chance to go really sour, as well as really well.”</p>
<p>William laughed, before he noticed, the room was quiet and only he was laughing. Daniel wasn't supet, he waited for William to finish, “So now you know what I'm talking about, are you in or not?”</p>
<p>“Give me five minutes to think about it”</p>
<p>“You have two”</p>
<p>William dropped his fist from his chin to the table, and in that time he had made up his mind. “I've worked all my life in low dead end jobs going nowhere, kissing and giving half my money that I earn to bosses who smile and treat me like their equal. I'm in, I'm in, I'm in”</p>
<p>“Great” Daniel stood up. He slanted his eyes away around the room, his attitude had suddenly become more cautious, “It's high risk, and dangerous”</p>
<p>“I'm in, I'm in, I'm in”</p>
<p>“The next time we meet is on the 16th of September, and everyone will be gathered there. Your name will be Mr. Melancholy” Daniel nodded to make sure William understood.</p>
<p>“And you are?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Angry”</p>
<p>“Okay” William stood up as well, and they walked out of the suddenly small staff lounge from different doors. They didn't wave bye because there was no need to.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="eight-a-little-more-development-of-relationships">eight: A little more development of relationships</h3>
<p>After night fell, the hotel belonged to the night porter, they were the person who managed all customer complaints of those few who couldn't fall asleep. She drove aroudn the village to look for suspicious activity; for tourists doing a little more than touring, and for tourists doing a little more than reproducing.</p>
<p>The night porter on the weekdays was Melanie, she was a forty six year old woman who had graduated from an obscure college with a degree in philosophy specialising in metaphysics. Every night she roamed through the corridors of the hotel checking the doors were locked, looking in dark places, and watching movies. She cleaned for three hours, the floor and bathrooms, but afterwards apart from regular security checks, she could do what she liked.</p>
<p>On this night Gerry, the receptionist, went in to count money, he called the night porter to take him from his hotel room down below, all the way to behind reception. The night porter drove around and smelled the air. Looking for fire, and the guy next to her who was supposed to light her primitive fire.</p>
<p>When Melanie was gone, the staff door opened and Charlotte came through. She was wearing a dark blue nightgown that made her shoulders look small, and she walked like a sparrow seeing everything instantly. When she got to the bar there was another woman waiting for her. She was wearing casual clothes, with small shoes, and her eyes were excited to see Charlotte. The two women met here frequently in the early hours of the morning and talked, Charlotte sometimes finished work at eleven, and by the time she was relaxed enough to chat it was past midnight. </p>
<p>The other woman was 'Angela'</p>
<p>They shared everything that happened and compared and contrasted what they heard and said with others. When it was all done people from all over the world came around to ask them how they were doing. Or that's what they believed. It was lucky for them to both have each other to share stories to. Angela shared a story of how when she was eleven she was kissed underneath a table, it was her first.</p>
<p>Charlotte laughed, she found the story lucrative, but left it at that. Many people came past and looked around and did things, but they kept talking; their conversation had no chance of being overheard and understood. “Why don't you write a book about it?” </p>
<p>The way she said it though, was sarcastic, but in a friendly way. What Charlotte meant was that everyone wanted to write a book, and not everyone should. Everyone amplified their own views and did their own things.</p>
<p>When Charlotte said this, Angela understood and nodded. They both knew they were lucky to have someone who could understand them so easily and follow all the small nuances that they smoothed through together.</p>
<p>“When I talk to you like this I feel like I remember who I am supposed to be, it's a weird thing, but when I'm doing work, or talking, or joking with people for too long, then I forget who and what I am supposed to do. Thank you, you really helped me this time.” This was said by Charlotte, but it could have been said by Angela as well with no change, in the end everyone would be satisfied with it.</p>
<p>As a few more hours passed people came and went more frequently, and then the lounge was empty. Angela and Charlotte both got up to leave the space, and then everyone was saying things to them.</p>
<p>Angela stood and looked out towards the city one thousand kilometres away. She couldn't believe that Charlotte had come from the same place as her, they had lived in the same neighbourhood and knew all the same streets. Charlotte frequently went to a busy cafe in the middle of town, and Angela said that she was doing the same. But they had never seen each other. Maybe they had, but they hadn't known that they would become such close friends.</p>
<p>Angela didn't know anything about the people around her, so she just made sure to tell everyone a bit of news that she could share, something they might enjoy, but nothing too spicy that they wouldn't be able to resist telling everyone about it, because that meant trouble.</p>
<p>Then after Charlotte left, Angela undid her bag and opened up the flap concealing all fo the pleasure, this was what she did late into the night when there was no one around to distract her. The conversations she had were fun and interesting, but she still had to keep moving forward with her life. The books she had were long overdue library books that she had decided not to return, and they would never be able to trace her address. The information inside was too valuable, and the people who put their things into these books were saying things that no one around her had ever said.</p>
<p>As she sat there highlighting passages, important words, sentences, meanings; she remembered how  she used to do this in the library in her hometown, when it seemed a lot more natural to do so, and being surrounded by other people her age also studying things. It was a small library that she frequented whenever she felt the need for learning arise. Back then the library had been her only interaction with the outside world, and now it was once again.</p>
<p>She had been in the library on the weekend, it was a slow day outside. On this day the library was almost empty, books were all neatly in place. She was studying something new, after a few minutes she checked how much time had passed, and how many pages she had seen, and how many more to go. After the studying finished she could do whatever she liked, but it seemed so arduous, the end wasn't in sight, and every five minutes she started daydreaming about work, or about a romantic man who would come and sweep her off her feet. Each page dragged on like it was stuck to viscous oil, and dry Chinese superglue that felt like plastic.</p>
<p>On her right, her friend was playing computer games, and at the other end of the library her colleague from the cafe was half asleep and half doing things. Angela felt like the freedom of being able to do what you like also felt so far away. She had to finish these pages before she could do anything that she wanted to. All the time, she found herself studying at home, developing complex crafts and skills while the voices of her friends shouting and laughing outside grew closer and further away. She didn't know why at the time, but she naturally wanted to be there with them.</p>
<p>She kept the study up, because it was what would pull her out of her monotonous life, unlike a lot of the others here, she had dreams and things that she wanted to uphold and fulfill. She never talked about her dreams with people too easily, because the more she talked about it, it made her less motivated to do it. It was like even just talking about something made it more real and less precious. So the fewer words she said about it, the more special it felt. Only a significant few knew what she did every night, and they always supported her, but none of them had dreams or ideas, or a place to go, they just lived their life everyday working and doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Angela sighed and leaned back on the couch, she glanced around the room resitng her head against the back of the couch. She was beginning to feel tired and weary, but she knew that if she slept, the next day she would wake up to a full eight more hours of work. </p>
<p>She glanced down her body, it was slim for someone who ate a lot and sat inside all day. Her legs were also really slim, in University she had been proud of them, but after she earned her degree and entered the workforce they seemed to matter less and less.</p>
<p>She glanced up at the ceiling, the light twitched and a moth slapped itself against the bulb. She saw the dim shadow of it flutter across the room and sit still on her nose.</p>
<p>Angela had always been lonely, but she didn't realize it until now. She wanted to further herself, she wanted to make herself someone special who would be remembered, a Cleopatra in a world of swine.</p>
<p>Her solution was this, these dirty library pages that she perused through were what kept her heart beating. At least they were supposed to, but when she actually tried to, they seemed dead and stagnant as well.</p>
<p>She shook her head and leaned forward, at this time of night she always started to find reasons to hate herself. She pulled out another book, a slim book on how to learn Korean. She flipped through the pages, earnestly trying to understand it, wanting to finish the daily quota. This was her expression of volition in life.</p>
<p>People all came around and said things to her. But now one man stepped in, he flowed in smoothly like the water from a tap that stops it from splashing everywhere. Then he pulled up a chair and sat opposite her. He was wearingz a housekeeping uniform and a mysterious stare. Angela looked up breifly, but then looked back down at her study, his gaze was powerful and she knew he wanted her to be looking.</p>
<p>“I know you're interested in me” he said. </p>
<p>“No I'm not” she didn't look up and turned a page with force. “I'm studying, I don't mean to be rude...but...”</p>
<p>“You know, when you look up into the sky, there's pictures everywhere in the stars, human meaning that people have drawn into constellations. No questions asked about the sky”</p>
<p>She looked up, “Why are you telling me this?”</p>
<p>“Mars was the goddess of war goddess of war. There is no human meaning in jewellery, and gold, but we place it there, and it's only valuable because we trust that everyone else will also place the same value on gold that we have. And the value of it is changing all of the time. If we could buy and sell stars and constellations, we would.”</p>
<p>“Once again” Angela crossed her arms, “Why are you telling me this?” He was becoming annoying.</p>
<p>“If you steal a few dollars here and there you're pitiable and forgiveable, if you steal a lot fo money, then you're a thief. But if you steal so much money that it can't be counted, you're a hero, doing a great service for the world. It's a strange way that the world thinks.”</p>
<p>“What are you here for, you're going arounding extorting all the girls again? I know that's what you do”</p>
<p>“No I don't, I want to ask you something, about your dating history” he said.</p>
<p>“It's none of your business”</p>
<p>“If you tell me” Daniel leaned forward, his jeans stretched aroundhis groin like a spider web with tension. Either he was really excited or really big. “I'll pay you”</p>
<p>“You're going to pay me to tell you my dating history? If that's the case I can just tell you without any money, you're like a housekeeper right? Are you sure you can be spending your limited resources so easily?” She tested him, but he didn't mind.</p>
<p>“If you tell me” he said, “Then I'll tell you what I'm thinking”</p>
<p>Angela didn't know why she was going along with this, he was crazy, but she was lonely, and she did want some company. “I am twenty seven” she said, “Don't tell anyone, but that's my real age, some people think I'm thirty two, some think I'm eighteen, but my real age is twenty seven”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded. “So what?”</p>
<p>And that made her smile, because he genuinely didn't care about her age, it made her relax and feel foolish for caring. :When I was twenty three I met a man, we dated for three years and I was engaged to him, the ring wasn't very big, and it wasn't very small, it was just another ring, but I didn't mind because I loved him.” She sighed, this was where it got complicated, this was where she would be judged. “Then one day I wanted to go overseas, and I asked him if he wanted to come along, and he said no he wouldn't that I should stay with him. Well, things happened and I called it off, and he was depressed and could hardly smile, only force one or two a week. But I was surprised at how little I cared, I genuinely didn't mind it, and if I listen to my heart, I must have not liked him that much.”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, “I notice that in romance there are three figures, the two people and the heart itself, if your heart isn't in it, then it just isn't and no amount of tweaking or hoping is going to change that. It's something beyond our control and power.”</p>
<p>“How do you notice something like that?' Angela said, “That's not something that you just notice, you feel it and trudge through it before finally feeling it, right? I mean I always wonder if I really loved him in the first place. Or maybe he just wasn't the right person, and that's why it didn't work out between us. Or was the timing just wrong? I believe that if you get with the right person, there's a sixth sense, something special that tells you that it's the right man. But the more I think about it the more I don't know if that is just huge tanks of oxytocin emptying themselves out in my bloodstream. Who knows.”</p>
<p>“On the surface it's love, but deep inside it's a complax web of thoughts and motivations and interactions and comparisons and hormones isn't it?” Daniel said. And Angela felt weird that he was saying all these things. Particularly so, because she didn't know anythign about him,</p>
<p>“Is marriage just a matter of convenient timing? Or is it actually something special between people that can't be replaced by any other two people?”</p>
<p>“Who knows” Angela shrugged. “I go to the cafe and sometimes a certain cup of coffee tastes like bliss with milo on top. But then next time I go back to reaffirm the taste, it's not bliss anymore. SO you know, who knows?”</p>
<p>“It's something gets done in the middle of chaos, that's what it feels like to me” Daniel said. “Sometimes a cup of coffee tastes like childhood to me, although it takes five minutes to make and uses the same ingredients as my coffee at home, for one time it tastes like childhood”</p>
<p>Then Daniel picked up, “You know why I'm asking this, don't feel weird okay, but I talked ot another woman.”</p>
<p>“So you're going to tell someone else what I just told you?”</p>
<p>“No, but I'll tell you what she said, she is about the same age as you, and she was dating a man, but things got complicated, actualy not really, she wanted to go overseas, to come to this country, and that was the thing she wanted to do most of all in her life. And that's why it woudln't work out. And then she came here and met someone else, and stuck with him. She didn't think about what if the other man had come with her, or if she had never left, or who was more important, she just falls in love with each one who she comes across with. Love requires patience, more than anything else, it takes time to grow and develop, and through time a lot of pain flows. But she met the next person and fell in love with him and forgot about all her previous romances, because they were a thing of the past, she whoelheartedly accepts whatever comes her way and bleeds with them. ” Daniel uncrossed his legs and crossed his arms, “I was her lover, and I asked her if I meant more to her than the other guys she dated and planned to marry. Then she said yes, because she is in so much pain, and woudln't be able to if she didn't care for me, but I had a hard time thinking our relationship was special, because if we broke up there and then, then all fo the conversations we had, everything we shared with each other, it is alsmot like it doesn't mean anything anymore, because they're forgotten by her and only rememebred by me. And a conversation is something that doesn't thrive in memory, but in interaction.” </p>
<p>“Wow, that's deep” Angela said. Now her book was completely shut, and she was scratching her nails and listening to Daniel talk, his story was fascinating, she had heard similar stories many times, but the way he said it was just out of this world. And the things he thought about, she thought he was just a plain housekeeper, but he was so much more.</p>
<p>“So even though she could accept me, I coudln't accept her, because I didn't feel special enough to her” he said, “I felt like just another guy in the factory line there to entertain her, and she is sitting there with toys going past allfor the purpose of entertaining her.”</p>
<p>“So did you break it off as well?” Angela said.</p>
<p>“No” Daniel shook his head, “It's the opposite, I can't give up on her, she's the woman of my life, I know that because I can't think about anything else except her, and she is in everything. We have different core morals, and different ways of living. And those are difficult to overcome, unless there's something else.”</p>
<p>“She sounds really amazing” Angela said, “I want to meet her”</p>
<p>“You'll be amazed, she's the most perfect woman in the world”</p>
<p>Hearing Daniel describe her made Angela a bit jealous of this woman she had never met, who she could only picture from the corner of her eyes, the edges of a picture frame. What kind of man talked about someone they loved with this much praise? She had never heard anything this romantic. She wished a man would say that about her, and thought about her ex boyfriends, none of them would say something like that, they were too self obsessed and piggish to.</p>
<p>Then she wondered, if Daniel fell for me instead, then would that mean that I am better than this woman? More valuable. These thoughts went through her mind while she smiled and acted acceptable and generous. People always said she was nice, but these thoughts always ran through her head.</p>
<p>“So what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“I'm going to find the ultimate entertainment” Daniel said, something that will keep her coming back all the time for more and more, something that will make her think that I am special and different from all others. I don't just want to be another lover, I don't even want to be a normal married couple, I want to stand out with her as something original and unique.”</p>
<p>“Gosh, you've got a big ego, stop saying that” she said, but she was attracted to him even more.</p>
<p>“So I'm going to take something” she said, “Something that is going to wring her heart and make her devoted to me above everyone else”</p>
<p>“But she already said you're special to her right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but so is everyone else” Daniel said, “You get it? She's slept with so many men already, and she's in lvoe with eahc of them.”</p>
<p>“I think you're over extending yourself, just be grateful that she likes you. Anyway, so what is this thing you're going to take?”</p>
<p>“One day” he said, “You will see, everyone will know what it is, you won't know until it's missing. But one day you can look at the empty hole left behind and say, That's what Daniel took, that's what he was talking about” ”</p>
<p>“You're delusional, is that what you wanted to tell me?”</p>
<p>The wave of laughter from him has started. He is going to laugh for a while now, about everything and anything that goes on. And he laughed for a while. Deep into the night the two of them talked, about something so deep to them that it was affecting them both.</p>
<p>“You're still studying?” Daniel said, looking at Angela's closed books.</p>
<p>“What's that got to do with anything?” Angela said, “That's a random change of topic”</p>
<p>“Your study isn't going to get you anywhere, seriously, I went to University and now I'm cleaning toilets and making beds everyday.”</p>
<p>“Well I'm not you okay? I actually have a purpose and direction in my life” Then she changed her tact, her study didn't seem very important anymore. “If I was this woman, and you were in love with me, then would you also do the same for me?”</p>
<p>Daniel nodded, “Yes of course, but you're not are you?”</p>
<p>Angela stomped her foot, the shoelaces wobbled up and down like jelly. “How do you know what I'm studying is useless?”</p>
<p>“Because everyone studies” he said, “And everyone studies the same thing, and everyone becomes the same, that's why I'm not studying.”</p>
<p>“Who is this woman you're in love with, do I know her?”</p>
<p>He shook his head, “She's not in magazines, and she's not rich, and she doesn't wear a uniform or a label, she's just a woman”</p>
<p>“I'm going to find out” Angela said.</p>
<p>“One day” Daniel stood up and put his hand on the edge of the chair, “You're going to see something big disappear, then you can try and figure it out okay?”</p>
<p>And after Daniel was gone Angela still didn't know what just happened, and why Daniel came here to talk to her about this. She looked down at her books, they seemed pointless now, and she kept forgetting what was written in them, she felt like something important was left behind. She lay back and then packed up.</p>
<p>That was enough study for today.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="nine-where-they-all-meet-and-its-like-a-real-proper-symposium">nine: Where they all meet and it's like a real proper Symposium</h3>
<p>Daniel stood in the female bathroom. It was deep into the night and the clock struck three am. With the twelfth ring the door swung open and Gerry walked in. He looked up at Daniel and couldn't help smiling. </p>
<p>“You're looking smart” Gerry was wearing a grey merino cardigan. Inside was a black striped tie. Daniel was wearing his Housekeeping uniform, short sleeved and with a bleach stain above the right hip.</p>
<p>“Stop your gay attitude and sit down” Daniel was annoyed, his alarm had gone off two minutes late and now he had to reorganize this place.</p>
<p>Moments later two more guys walked in, it was Jason, one of the porters. He was wearing his pyjamas, brown fluffy teddy bears and Hello Kitty bottoms. He held the door open for William who came in behind him.</p>
<p>William looked around, </p>
<p>“Sit down all of you”</p>
<p>“Sit where?” Gerry demanded, “We're in a bathroom, there's no seats anywhere”</p>
<p>“Sit in the cubicles then, I don't want to see your face” Daniel pushed Gerry aside and sat on the floor with his legs crossed, the others all sat down gradually and faced him. </p>
<p>William kept looking around, “What is this place?” He glanced up at the ceiling and the sparkling faucets. The sink was an elaborate diagonal panel that had the water deceptively stream away neatly.</p>
<p>“It's our meeting spot, you're new right? Nice to meet you” Jason held out his hand to William and they shook. William's hand was warm with excitement. </p>
<p>“Are you sure no one's going to come here?” All William had been told was this was a million dollar venture, it was risky, and to meet in the Female bathrooms at 3am on this day October. When he walked in to see all these men here he was surprised. He kept asking questions and no one answered, they stared back at him.</p>
<p>“Is it something to do with sexuality? Is that why we're gathered here? Are we going to do something perverted?”</p>
<p>Jason looked at Daniel. His look said Why'd you hire this guy to come along, he's going to put us all in</p>
<p>“We're waiting for two more” Daniel said, his watch was two minutes past, which meant that they were two minutes more likely to attract unwanted attention. He told them that they couldn't be late, but they weren't coming through.</p>
<p>The boys heard tip tapping coming closer, the taps stopped in front of the door and it swung open. A woman all in black came in, her hair was black and straightened down like string brushes, her blazer was ironed to a metallic smoothness, and when she breathed her chest came out like mountains. She wore a short pencil dress that wrapped around her thighs like a sushi roll. Her stockings were a transparent darkness that disappeared into her shoes. Her shoes had sparks of red, William didn't want to know what that was.</p>
<p>She nodded to Daniel and walked past the men, taking a lean against the sink in the far corner. </p>
<p>“One more” The men kept staring at this new woman, none of them had seen her around the hotel, and that by itself welcomed attention.</p>
<p>The door opened and Annalise walked in. She was wearing a nice cardigan with all sorts of colours on it. Everyone looked at her and saw that she was serious. </p>
<p>Gerry's frown was visible, but his surprise was greater. “What's she doing here?” He pointed to her like she was a place, and looked at Daniel.</p>
<p>“She's, a valuable part of the team” Annalise grinend and crossed her arms. “You never expected me did you, I'm going to make your life a living pain”</p>
<p>Gerry groaned. </p>
<p>“Okay, since we're all here, let's start.” Daniel made evryone sit on the floor and face him. The woman with the pencil skirt stood tall without a word. Daniel looked up at her annoyed, then laughed to himself and began.</p>
<p>“None of you know each other, you may know each other, but from here on we dont' know each other as our names. Now that you've all agreed to join this job, I'm going to be setting up procedure, and if any one of you at any point disagrees...”He twisted his fists, “Well, there's going to be consequences” He pointed to William, “You're Mr. Melancholy” Jason was Mr. Lazy, Annalise was Mr. Chatterbox, and The woman standing in the corner was Mr. Purple, and Gerry was Mr. Dangerous. </p>
<p>Finally Daniel pointed to himself, “And from here henceforth you will know me as Mr. Angry” He smiled, “Is that clear?”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. The woman in the pencil skirt shuffled uncomfortably, moving her legs. Gerry kept glancing up at her, he wanted to know where she was from and what she was doing here. What was her name?</p>
<p>Daniel stole the attention of the room, everyone was a little nervous around him. “This is your last chance to leave” Daniel said, “I'm going to explain what's going to happen and each of your roles, but if you're posessing even a small amount of uncertainty, then you must leave now. I don't want any unsteady hands in this job. And if you leave after I tell you whjat I'm about to say, I'm going to have to kill you”</p>
<p>Outside, a female guest from the hotel needed to go to the bathroom urgently, her man was occupying the bathroom in their room, so she walked out into the hall to use the public one. But this one next to reception had a sign out that said “Cleaning in Progress”</p>
<p>She hesitated there, she was desperate, but should she go in or not? 
Then when she put her ear  next to the door she heard laughing inside, and some deep talking.</p>
<p>She decided not to go in and went to look for a different bathroom. What could be happening in the hotel at this hour?</p>
<p>Moments after she was gone the bathroom door opened and a scary man poked his neck out, with nothing in sight he went back in and the spring on the door slowly let the door shut.</p>
<p>Inside the bathroom the tension had risen so much that you could sell it for a profit. The woman against the counter was shuffling uncomfortably, and Jason's legs had become uncrossed. Everyone was itching to move. Everyone in the room had become uncertain, was this somehting that they could really do? William stared at his hands, could he really do this? If he left now then everything would be fine, he wouldn't be in trouble, and he wouldn't lose anything.</p>
<p>He looked around, what were the others thinking? He didn't want to be left out if they went, but he also didn't want to join this and fail. Then what would others think?</p>
<p>Gerry was in it, he was sure, he wanted to take this risk, make something come. He had enough of standing at reception. Besides, he looked at Annalise sitting quietly next to him, looking up at the ceiling with her slim neck. She was in the same boat as him right? He didn't know why she had been approached by Daniel, did she have something more than he did? But they had the same job and had come to this hotel at about the same time, that made him feel a little more secure.</p>
<p>“I'm staying” he said. And so did everyone else. The door didn't open again, and the nervous breathing in the room slowly wound down and became quiet.</p>
<p>Then, after everyone shook their legs, leaned back in their seats. </p>
<p>Angela just walked past and into the bar, she sat down and leaned back in her chair, thinking of how she should study. But her mind kept filling with thoughts of Daniel and the conversations that she had with him, she felt a little guilty and exposed for telling him everything, but happy that she could tell someone that. </p>
<p>When one of the guests outside walked past, he saw a girl sitting who was his daughter's age. She had some books spread out and was studying diligently, her hair was blocking her vision from him. But he knew that if she looked his way she was prettier than his daughter. His own daughter didn't amount to much, she hadn't had a boyfriend and she just listened to what her mother told her.</p>
<p>Because of some reason or another, he went over to the bar and sat down in a seat where he could watch her. She looked from the corner of her eye to see someone approaching, then looked back down to her books. The man was excited, for some reason.</p>
<p>And now he was embarrassed. She was far too young for him, what was he doing? But being here and attracting her attention also made him feel younger, and that he could still pull female gaze.</p>
<p>If his wife and daughter saw him now they would be so upset. But they were always upset.</p>
<p>He went to his daughter's school shows, High school shows and saw young girls in white uniform talking excitedly about things and hugging each other. They had so much energy/</p>
<p>One of the older girls, he thought was the most beautiful person he had ever seen, she had sly eyes and dressed like it didn't matter. And she was always talking to her friend./</p>
<p>Anyway, he stood up and walked back to his room, to where his wife was snoring, the room key was in his pocket. He felt like a pretty random fool who wanted to be young again. No one would accept these strange values that he had.</p>
<p>Angela looked up as the man walked away, she had no idea why he had walked in, and what he was doing. But now that he was gone she would turn her music on full.</p>
<p>The man walked past reception, and turned right. If he had turned left, he might walked past the female bathrooms where the meeting was being held, but he didn't he walked in the opposite direction from it.</p>
<p>Back in the bathroom, Daniel was starting to portray his strategy. “The only reason we're meeting in a bathroom like this one is because of the complicated hotel life during the day, we're going to be meeting now, but during the day we will work normally as well.”</p>
<p>Daniel was sitting cross-legged and facing everyone, “We have a team of six of us, each of us will specialize in our own jobs, but in the end it will all fall together. Just don't ask any questions and trust me okay? I have everything planned out”</p>
<p>Mrs. Purple raised her hand. She still was standing, and she still looked bored. “What is the job? Daniel, if you don't tell us...”</p>
<p>Daniel flamed, he didn't say a word but he didn't need to and Mrs. Purple stopped midsentence. “I'm Mr. Angry, this is a security measure that you must not f<strong>*</strong> breach”</p>
<p>Mrs. Purple sat down, she dropped her smoke in the sink. “Okay, okay chill”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked around the room, “You all came to this job agreeing to a million dollars, but as you've been informed, the methods of obtaining this substantial sum has come under question y a few of our members. If you think the job is risky, you're right. If you think you might die, you're right. If you think I care for your well being, you're wrong. I don't give a f<strong><em>* sh</em>* f</strong>* what happens to any of you, I'm the same as all of you, I'm in it for the money” Mr. Angry smiled and looked around the room, “And I'm sure you're all the same, we're here for the money. You know what a million dollars will get you? Have you thought about it?”</p>
<p>“Half a house, with our modern real estate prices” Mr. Lazy said, but he shut his mouth when Mr. Angry gave him the skinny asian eyes.</p>
<p>William didn't know if Daniel was faking this facade to make himself look scary to gain everyone's respect and attention, or if this was the real Daniel and the friendly inquisitive Daniel he had known up until now had been the facade. Anyway it was too late for him to back out, he was involved. Besides, Daniel looked cool when he was angry, he wished he could be like him.</p>
<p>“If you're wondering what it is we're going to do, then this is where we get serious, I want no objections, no one is to say a word until I drop my fist” He held his fist up and looked around the room, not for questions, but for mouths to shut up. No one dared say a word, they just stared silently back. William was excited to hear what came next.</p>
<p>“We're going to steal the most valuable thing in this hotel, and it's in General Manager's room in the Penthouse.”</p>
<p>Annalise gasped, Daniel rolled his eyes like a gay fashion designer and threw a fist at her. It hit her in the cheek and she collapsed, there was a big red mark.</p>
<p>“I don't care what you say, you have to listen to me, I told you that already, I don't care if you're a f**** woman or a man or a horny lizard.” Annalise was scroleld on the ground, and the others rushed to her. </p>
<p>“That's a demonstration of my seriousness, and if any of you steps out again, I won't hesitate to get rid of you” After he paused to gain his breath, everyone else said things.</p>
<p>“Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>No one knew, no one dared to even shake their head, Mr. Chatterbox was holding her cheek like a monster had grown on the side of her mouth. </p>
<p>“Is it gold?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Is it in the safe at reception?”</p>
<p>“This is how I feel” Mr. Angry snapped his fingers, and Mr. Purple rolled her eyes for him from the other side of the room. “I already told you it's in the GM's room”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked around, he scoured the room with his neck craned, beads of sweat were gathering on the part of his neck that joined to his shirt, and he looked unhappy. “Since none of you can guess, we're going to steal the Manager's Wife's Virginity” he said. “That's what it is, that's what it's always been.”</p>
<p>“You can gasp now” He looked up, but everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>“You mean you called us into this insane meeting, and plan this thing for three years, to sleep with a woman?”</p>
<p>“Does this...virginity...make, money?” Even William was stunned.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry brought out a piece of paper and scrolled it on the ground, there were specks of dust that he flicked away. His big hands seemed too large for the thin paper, but he held it still like a hostage. “This is a map of the premises, we're here” he pointed, “The GM's room is in the penthouse, but I'm sure all of you know that normal employees are unable to gain access to it, the housekeepers never touch it, it's cleaned privately by the GM's fiance Eva.” he mapped the area and showed us a photo, no one knew how he got the photo, but they were surprised because it was sparkling with gold, the normal hotel corridors were red wallpaper with brown wooden columns and a red carpet with patterns of diagonal stars stretching on into the distance. </p>
<p>This picture Mr. Angry showed them was something completely new, like an Egyptian temple that had been untouched. </p>
<p>“We'll use the elevator, all of the floors are different remember”</p>
<p>“In the elevator I'm sure you know the top floor needs special access, only a few people in the building have access to it” The GM himself, and the personal housekeeper for that whole area, she cleans it once a week. Only the GM and a few VIP customers walk there so it stays tidy.</p>
<p>Jason used the elevator all the time, but he only went from the third floor where the Security back area was, to the ground floor, to talk to Reception about things. Sometimes he went to the second floor to visit the cafe, but otherwise he never ventured to the higher floors. Sometimes he boarded the elevator with the GM, and they ha da brief chat until he got off, that was the only time he saw the top floors lighted up in the elevator, it was an eerie orange glow, like something valuable was hidden behind the button.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry scoured the room, “The door to the GM's room is only accessible with a card that the GM personally carries around at all times. No one else has access to it, I bet you didn't think our hotel had such a tough security system, but the security managers are the only ones who know about it. They keep their lips shut, and if anyone asks, they refer them to the GM.”</p>
<p>The GM was such a nice man, he greeted everyone and treated everyone kindly. It was rumoured that he had video cameras in his office of every part of the hotel, but who knew if it was true. William coudln't imagine that man doing or saying anythign like that. It wasn't a bad thing, but there was a gap in his actions.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry pushed it further, “Mr. Melancholy, Mr. Purple, Mr. Lazy, Mr. Danger, Mr. Chatterbox, do any of you have questions” The way he said it was a statement, not a question. And the way he waited for their answers was a demand, not an offer.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy looked around then asked first. “I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand what we're doing, this is a heist right? That's what I got from the gist of what you're saying, and from us meeting here at such a dodgy time.”</p>
<p>“If it's a heist” Mr. Chatterbox said, she trubbed the cheek she had been slapped on, it was still glowing red. “Then we're supposed to steal something right? And exactly what is it that we're stealing? Can anyone make that clear to me?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry uncrossed his legs slowly, he outstretched them and held them out in front of him and balanced on his butt. Then he leaned forward and stood up and walked out. “I'm going to the men's” With one hand in his pocket he pushed the door open and slid out.</p>
<p>The door swung blindly back and forth, trying to commit and settle down. It was still swinging when everyone started speaking.</p>
<p>“Someone's virginity” Mr. Danger said, “That's what he said we're stealing”</p>
<p>“Is he an idiot? How is that worth any money? I gave mine up when I was sixteen and didn't get a cent, and didn't lose a cent.” Mr. Purple shook her head in disgust. She was still standing in the corner and leaning against the sink, she erotically extended her fingers and crawled them over the faucet, letting the water trickle out and retreat back in.</p>
<p>“It's more about what he wants, look he just disappeared again, I bet the money is a big joke” Mr. Melancholy said. </p>
<p>Mr. Lazy got up and kicked the cubicle doors open in frustration, “What are we doing here, can we all just agree to quit? This guy, Daniel, he's an idiot. He's a dictator wannabe, but actually he doesn't know the first thing about stealing, I used to know a guy...”</p>
<p>“Oh you used to know a guy?” Mr. Purple stepped forward and kicked the cubicle door that Mr. Lazy was standing next to, it crashed against the tiles of the back wall like a truck bursting through a brick wall. “Every one of us f<strong><em>* losers used to know a guy, that's why we're so rich and working the minimum wage in a f</em></strong><em> hotel” Her tone suddenly increased and it made the hairs on Mr. Melancholy's head rise. He never expected this woman to be so rich with fury. “So why don't you take your hairy a</em>* back to that guy you know and ask him for a real job?”</p>
<p>But Mr. Lazy didn't back down, as if he were used to it, “What made you so mad all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple looked around, she spun on her heels like a figure skater briefly, but then she just looked angry. “All of you, every single one of you, you're looking at me like I'm meat, I know what you're thinking, you want to take advantage of me, undermine me, I've had enough of you men, you're not going to boss me around. I'm here because I want to be here.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy walked up to her and stared her in the face, now that he saw her up close she wasn't so perfect, her sunglasses hid her acne, and her hair was wire stiff like a dog brush. Only her attitude was hard. She needed a good softening. He knew how to do that, it wasn't the first time.</p>
<p>“Why don't you stop shoving every guy you meet up your vagina and start talking to them like real people, it's f<strong><em>* feminists like you who destroy the f</em></strong>** peace that we have.”  </p>
<p>That did it, Mr. Purple stamped the ground, her calm complexion had all but disappeared, her teeth were wide and snarling, and now that they were exposed, some of them were crooked. She screamed and clenched her fists. “I hate you” she was a kid.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry came back in, he walked straight past everyone and sat back on the ground. </p>
<p>“You had a comfortable leak? A very productive time?” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry took something out of his pocket. “If it's money that's keeping us here, I'll show you what we're going to get”</p>
<p>Everyone's eyes widened. They saw a gold sparkling triangle in front of them.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry breathed heavily, he had been meditating on this for a while, and he felt guilty that he couldn't be more patient with these people he had gathered. </p>
<p>“I'm sorry if I lost my cool earlier” He forced a smile and it came out like a Picasso picture, “I'm sure you've seen more things in the world than I have, but I'm actually a very nice person”</p>
<p>Everyone believed him, because nice people always said that. Only a nice person could say such a thing.</p>
<p>“Anyone know what this is?” Mr. Angry held out the picture in front of everyone.</p>
<p>“It's gold” Mr. Melancholy said. He noticed Mr. Chatterbox, and Mr. Danger's eyes were gleaming.</p>
<p>“It's 14k pure gold to be exact” Mr. Angry said, “This printout is the only reamining picture of one of the world's finest treasures” he passed the picture to Mr. Lazy who sat closest to him, the edges of it scrolled shut when it wasn't being held awake.</p>
<p>“Does anyone know what it is?” Mr. Angry was a primary school teacher. No one knew what it was,  it was an unfamiliar shape, it wasn't a gold brick, it wasn't a pendant, and it wasn't a necklace or bracelet, it was much thicker and weirder shaped.</p>
<p>“Is it a chastity belt?” Mr. Purple said. “Is that what they look like?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry nodded, and for the first time a genuine sincere sweet humane smile crossed his lips. He had been wishing to hear those words for a long time.</p>
<p>“In our hotel, in this very hotel, in the penthouse, is a very special woman” he said, “The GM”s wife to be, her name is Helen Alexandra”</p>
<p>“Helen Alexandra” Mr. Lazy repeated, “That's a beautiful name”</p>
<p>“Really?” Mr. Danger said, “I never heard of the GM being married”</p>
<p>“So he's not married, Listen properly, I didn't say he was married did I?” Mr. Angry said, “She is said to be the prettiest, most erotic, sexy and most beautiful woman in the world, but no one has ever seen her except a select few.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple sighed, “Does she even exist? Are you sure about this?”</p>
<p>“I researched for three years, and that led me to this hotel, that the world's most expensive treasure is here, with Helen Alexandra, protecting themost valuable chastity in the world”</p>
<p>“I've heard of the belt” Mr. Purple said, “It was the back talk of some groups I worked with, but it was just a legendary story, something the guys joked about when they were horny and I didn't let them. I don't think anyone believed it really existed” </p>
<p>“It does” Mr. Angry's eyes sparkled, “And it's upstairs in that room, walking around like a lioness, it's on that goddess who walks around on it all the time.”</p>
<p>“If there is a woman up there, the most beautiful woman or whatever” Mr. Melancholy said, “Then why haven't we heard about her, why have I not known anything? And why is she in the room all the time, if I had a beautiful flower I would show it to the world, not keep it in my room,”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry nodded, “Exactly, that's what I thought at first, but the more I thought about it, it made sense, some people are different, they're of a different type of mentality to us, and I believe the GM is one of those, he talks and greets everyone normally, but that's his job, in reality he's a private man, a very private man, and the most improtant things to him, he keeps hidden from everyone else. For him at least, that validates their worth. A secret is only valuable if it is unknown to everyone else”</p>
<p>Then Mr. Angry stood up. “But we're not supposed to be talking about the woman, she's just the Cerberus that we have to walk through to get to the treasure, she's just the final guard, the real treasure is the chastity belt. It is from Egyptian times, and was supposed to be worn by princesses to guarantee their virginity until they were ready to be penetrated by royals.”</p>
<p>“Don't be fooled” he said, “She's a succubus, she's the final test to the treasure, and the guardian. The GM was gifted her when he did something noble for the right friends, but he hasn't been able to marry her because he doesn't have the key to unlock the belt.” Mr. Angry looked really proud for a while, “I have the key, I found the key to unlock the belt, so don't worry.”</p>
<p>“How do you know this is the real belt?” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>“Because I traced it here with my research, and I asked top jewellers all over the world, the last time it was seen was in Paris in 1983, and since then it has disappeared, it's safe to assume that it was given straight to Helen when she was born, and grew with her. As far as she is, she knows no different, she's just constantly wearing it, so she shoud have accepted it into her life.”</p>
<p>All the men in the bathroom pictured this beautiful woman, there were no pictures of her, there were no records of her, it was all word of mouth, but they pictured the most amazing and perfect woman that they could, by amalgamating all of the beautiful women they had seen and eliminating every flaw. Then they started to get excited.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox and Mr. Purple didn't get excited, Mr. Purple rolled her eyes at the mens' lust, it was ludicrous, and Mr. Chatterbox felt a twinge of jealousy pulse through her, but she pushed it aside, there was no point being jealous of someone she knew nothing about.</p>
<p>“The chastity belt was crafted using the finest gold, and it was recast until it was almost 100% pure. The idea was that it would have to be as pure as possible if it were to be worn by the purest woman in the world.”</p>
<p>“I don't like that, the way you say it, it sounds like a woman has to be beautiful to be pure” Mr. Chatterbox said</p>
<p>Mr. Angry nodded, “Yes, and so?” he didn't wait for an answer, “It was rumoured to be worth as much as the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia.”</p>
<p>“How can jewellery be compared to a country?” Mr. Lazy said, “Those are two completely different things”</p>
<p>“Because” Mr. Angry said, “When they made this artifact, it was rumoured to have cost so much that the whole civilization crumbled in its making. It cost the...” He paused, “Can you even imagine that?”</p>
<p>“So, Mesopotamia, that was like five thousand years ago? So what's that worth now, like one of the small villages we pass by? A few dollars?”</p>
<p>“Sure” Mr. Angry said, “But most recent estimates say that this belt may be worth up to $1 Billion”</p>
<p>The room fell silent, the leaking toilet had drops of water, and Mr. Purple stopped playign with the faucet, her fingers stopped moving.</p>
<p>“Before we get all surprised” Mr. Danger said, “I count money all day, and what currecny is this? If it's rupees or Yen we're screwed”</p>
<p>“It's not rupess, it's not Yen, it's heavy” he said.</p>
<p>“This chastity belt is so rich with gold that is smells like sin” Mr. Angry said, “Isn't that exciting?”</p>
<p>And for the first time, Mr. Angry looked anything but bored, he looked anything but nonchalant and carefree and regardless; for the first time he looked excited and forward, rich and enthusiastic with life. During work he was slow moving and thoughtful, whiel cleaning toilet bowls he was dreamy with his mind wandering elsewhere, and when he was making beds he only thought of when he could knock off for the day.</p>
<p>But now, for the first time, he was excited, and everyone in the room saw the excitement radiating off him and it rubbed into them. It was enough to convince them that this big treasure that he talked of, this priceless heritage, it was really there, it really existed, and it was within reach. </p>
<p>“And that” he said, “Is what we're going to have, that is what is going to be ours”</p>
<p>He needn't say more</p>
<p>Nne by one, they fell in line with him and his passion, and his crush on this immaculate treasure. </p>
<p>When the six left the bathroom, they left in unison, and they were running through the same idea, of grandness, richness, luxury, and status.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ten-a-little-bit-of-life-in-the-mix">ten: A little bit of life in the mix</h3>
<p>The morning arrived and sat over the hotel together with a cloud in the shape of the hotel. They sat there until noon when they went to have a tea break, probably to return back in the late afternoon again. A woman walked past reception. She was part of a tour group with thirty people and they were checking out at 10am. She wanted to have an early breakfast with her husband, he was waiting at the table for her. She went to the bathroom because she joined the ranks of the women who went because they actually needed to use the bathroom. There was no trace of the anything ever taken place, no wrappers, no toilet seats left up by men, and no bad aura, and she had no reason to suspect anything. But if someone were to come along with a fingerprint detector, they would find fingerprints of six people all over the bathroom. And they might find a few male hairs and questionable splashes around the toilet bowl. </p>
<p>Her husband sat at the table, when he had been left alone he looked out at the beautiful scenery that had placed the hotel here. The mountains stood up like the sun. If he took binoculars, he might be able to see something or someone there, climbing up slowly, arduously, not seen by anyone, and working hard at the task. To them, this was their most important accomplishment.</p>
<p>He had known since young that he knew what he wanted to do. The table next to him was talking about it, their children and University and paths in life. Parents loved to talk about their children.</p>
<p>When his wife returned she looked like a flower that had been watered. She was dressed up for this tour, he didn't know why she was so excited about it, or embarrassed by other things, but he just let her be that way. “It's so beautiful isn't it?” he said.</p>
<p>She looked at the food, “It's marvellous”</p>
<p>Although they had no reason to do so.</p>
<p>The Night Porter, Melanie, came back from a security check, and with nothing out of the ordinary, knocked off at 5 o' clock. She was going home to sleep well for a few hours, she usually woke up at 3 or 4 in the afternoon and did a few chores around the house. She had breakfast at 6pm, alone. Then lunch at 10pm, also alone. She had done the work for fifteen years, almost sixteen now, and the money she made, she began to see as atonement for her loneliness.</p>
<p>When she did the security checks, she went out past her house, it wasn't required, but she liked this route, and her garden was lit up with small flashing lights. At this hour no one was about, even the young drunk partiers were asleep somewhere. So these lights she switched on for herself, and turned off for herself. Not many people knew she had these lights.</p>
<p>“Last night” she told her dog, when she got home in the morning. Others waved good morning to her, they were on their way to work. “A tour leader in one of the big rooms yelled at me because one of his clients' air conditioners wasn't working, so I told him to tell them to use a blanket. Then he made me wait while he held the phone...” Melanie stopped speaking and looked up. The dog lay still, it's head against the carpet, listening for a heartbeat in the dense fur.</p>
<p>Then Melanie realized what she had forgotten, in fifteen years she had forgotten it only a few times,  she still had the alarm to the safe. It was pinned to her belt, she had to walk around with it, this was  obligatory, and she had to make sure it worked, the red light was supposed to be flashing. She didn't know how the small machine worked, and she didnt' know why the light had to be flashing, or why it was red, or why they used this machine as opposed to every other device made in China.</p>
<p>“I forgot to give you back, Catso” She named it Catso after another forgetful night she had ten years ago. “Now I have to walk back up there” She looked up the dark hallway that she switched the lights off to; now it wasn't dark anymore, it was bright and the lights were everywhere,the sun was shining down on the hotel.</p>
<p>“Why am I so sensitive?” she shook her head, she never wanted to do night work, she wanted to work in the day, but she was afraid of people looking at her, like she was another piece of furniture. She noticed small changes, in the sun, in the clouds, and in how people treated her. She walked past reception and the breakfast area where more of the tour group had gathered. And she didn't know them, but she walked past the man and woman looking out at the mountains.</p>
<p>To them, she was just another staff member who was walking past.</p>
<p>To Melanie, they were just another couple in the tour groups that came every day of every single day.</p>
<p>She went to staff dining for breakfast. It had just opened and everyone was getting started for the day. Melanie was a big woman, her waist outgrew her hips, and her cheeks were fat. She had glasses that sat on her nose and caught the flames of the fireplace when she read a book next to it. She always wore black pants and a faded light green vest over a brown woolen sweater. Today, she walked into breakfast, she went over to get her plate and sat down with some of the people she could talk to. Receptionists doing morning shift and catching breakfast on an early break, and the porters who were just starting. They all looked tired and weary. She listened to their conversation, sitting at the end of the table. The more she thought of herself, the more she wasn't important, in their lives, and why would anyone pay her any attention?</p>
<p>When she looked up, the chefs were busy, their day was starting, they joked about it together. There was a metal plate of hot food left over from the first breakfast, it was brown oyster sauce noodles. One of the chefs who she had to shut down parties with quite a few times, he playted loud music. He went over to the plate and shoved his fingers in, he looked at what he had caught and dropped some of the noodles from his greasy hands back into the plate. No one went to eat after he touched it. </p>
<p>“He's a chef” The girl next to Melanie said, it was Misty, she had been at work for an hour and was swallowing baked beans for half an hour. “I can't believe it, it's so disgusting”</p>
<p>Melanie glanced around, everyone on their table was staring at the chef in disbelief, then slowly, one by one, they began to laugh. It was early in the morning, and the occupants of the table second from the door, they all laughed because the chef was so ridiculous. Now they all knew why they were frequently getting diarrhea from this food, because it was so bad and nonsensical that this was actually happening.</p>
<p>“What do you think of me?” she said, “What are we?”
“I like you” she said, “But I want to start a family, I want to do thigns, and you're young, and you don't know what you want to do.” Two of the receptionists were speaking, they worked together, and now were startting a job together, but their conversationw as also interrupted when they looked up. No one complained, it was beyond the level of seriousness requried for complaints to form.</p>
<p>“Break it off, that way it will stay clean, your record will stay clean”'</p>
<p>“Yes, but woudlnt' that hrut her feelings?”</p>
<p>“You can't live your life trying not to hurt anyone's feelings, everywhere you step there's mussels under your feet, if you keep dodging them you dont' get anywhere. You can walk really slowly, but what's the point”</p>
<p>Melanie disagreed, but she didn't say anything, she just listened in on the conversation and didn't say anything, if she said something to these strangers it would get messy. They were sitting beside Misty, but Misty pretended not to hear them as well.</p>
<p>It was one thing to be talking about relationships. But it was another to care about it.</p>
<p>“I'm looking for someone to guide me and tell mehow I should live my life” he said,</p>
<p>“That's not my job” she said, “We support each other, remember, we said that”</p>
<p>“But I feel like...” she said. Then stopped. She looked around at us all listening in on her. “Let's continue this conversation later” she said. “When all the rats have disappeared” </p>
<p>She meant to say it as a joke, but the table flared up like the nostrils of a horse. </p>
<p>Melanie knew three types of people, those who lived today and looked at tomorrow as nostalgic and better. Then there werte those who lived today and dream of tomorrow. 
Then the third type was those who lived in the present. It was always more interesting, but people were clearly divided into these three categories, it was so obvious that you don't even really need to think about it much, it's just easy. She looked at Misty and tried ot classify her. She didn't know why, but if she could do this she would feel more satisfied. #thethingsthatsatisfyus. Sigh</p>
<p>In a corner of staff dining, the restaurant staff came in, they all came in together to take their break off. It was eight thirty by now, Melanie had been sitting her for almost an hour. The restaurant staff came in and organized a table together, then joked about work. They all wore the same light red uniform that looked like the salmon they were serving.</p>
<p>Then after the flow, two more came in, one new girl who was recently promoted, she was talking excitedly to the woman behind her, who was wearing white. She was the manager of the breakfast department. Melanie knew the woman well, they were neighbours. She walked around sometimes outside Melanie's house cleaning something. When she wasn't wearing uniform she looked out of place, and like a very low rank person, the way she dressed wasn't self respectful.</p>
<p>But right now, at work, as soon as she said something, everyone listened, and then after work, she was slightly ignored and everyone walked around her. Now Melanie knew why this woman wore her uniform for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Melanie had another personable theory, that there were two types of designs in all things, you could see it in nature, and in people, and in architecture and engineering. Some designs are for the closed space, some designs are for the open space. The souvenir shop is designed to look proper when it is open, and when it is closed it looks abnormal. It depends on which part of the design you emphasize.</p>
<p>Not that anyone cared. Melanie looked around and her table was empty, everyone had rushed off to work. She saw the back of Misty's figure walking out the door. Then she looked down at her half eaten cereal, and then at the namebadge she had been wearing for the past fifteen years, she couldn't remember if it was fifteen or if it had been replaced. No one cared about her half baked philosphies either.</p>
<p>Then as she sat there, it seemed like one person knew who she felt. The door swung open, a foot stepped in, it was a clean black shoe, the man walked over with a smile on his face, Melanie looked up, it was one of the housekeepers, he had a grin on that housekeepers didn't usually wear, and his shoes were like a billionaire driving a pick-up truck.</p>
<p>“Melanie” he got some cereal and sat down opposite her. He spoke quietly, as if it were a private conversation.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Melanie grunted, she was interested, but didn't want to betray her interest too soon. Besides, she had heard stories about this guy.</p>
<p>“Can you get me the keys to the bathroom?” he said.</p>
<p>Melanie shook her head, “I can't do that, it's against the rules. Besides, is that how you greet someone you're talking to?”</p>
<p>“Hi” he let go of his spoon and held out his hand, the spoon clashed into the milk, spilling a few drops onto the dirty table. Melanie noticed this man's sleeves were rolled up carefully, as if he had anticipated the cereal and the dirty table. “I'm Daniel, I'm a nice guy”</p>
<p>“Is that how you describe yourself?” Melanie's eyebrows moved, “I don't know if you're a nice guy, that's not something nice people say”</p>
<p>“That's why I'm telling you” he was smirking now, for some reason, and she didn't know why. “You can trust me, I never lie”</p>
<p>“That's also what these 'nice guys' say” Melanie scooped up her plate. “Why do you want the keys to the bathroom, you know you can use the bathroom any time right?”</p>
<p>“I'm going to tell you straight up, I want to unlock the female bathrooms next to reception, from 2am to 5am” he said.</p>
<p>Melanie grinned, “And you expect me to allow that? Are you some kind of perv or something?”</p>
<p>“No” he said, “I'm a nice guy”</p>
<p>Melanie nodded, “Okay, I got that, you've been saying you're a nice guy a few times now, you should go and talk to the boss, I don't know what you want to do in the female bathroom”</p>
<p>“Fine” Daniel said, he stood up and Melanie noticed he had already finished the cereal a while ago.</p>
<p>“Fine” Melanie sighed, “It's unlocked, but don't tell anyone I let you, I don't even know why I'm doing this for you”</p>
<p>Daniel smiled, “Because I'm a nice guy”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember” Melanie wasn't thrilled, her chin was doubling up over her neck. She climbed out of the chair like the ascent of everest, and dusted off the top of the table, smearing the milk into a long patch.</p>
<p>No one saw her leave breakfast.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="eleven-in-the-cafe-on-the-next-day">eleven: In the cafe on the next day</h3>
<p>The door on the second floor cafe was locked to perfection. It didn't budge, but if you twisted it from the inside, it would pop open like an Xmas box. The waiter closed the door and told a customer to go to the other door. The customer didn't understand him, so the waiter said it slowly, this time pointing.</p>
<p>The customer wandered over to that door, and then shouted to his family to follow him through. </p>
<p>Then two minutes later a coworker came over and unlocked the door, she stepped outside to do something. It wasn't a big deal, and nothing that would hit the news headlines (probably), but the man who went through the door saw it and became a little upset, not to the level of an irrational irateness, but just a mild disappointment. Even though he was from a foreign country, and of foreign blood, and a foreign culture, he felt like theworkers were arbitrary, and their arbitrary decisions affected him and his family, like it meant nothing at all.</p>
<p>And, in his foreign language, he complained about this, in his mild and respectful way, he never forgot about it and always talked about it, and always remembered it whenever he was upset about anything, for him, this was an absolutely worst experience, and should not be happening in any hotel, or just anywhere in general, especially a five star hotel. When he went back to his home, from the country he had come from, with it's dingy alleys and noisy nights. In the line at the night market, when he was bored, he would start to remember his time at this hotel and then feel upset about it.</p>
<p>But after he and his family finished their tea, he smiled and thanked the waiter, and they all left together. The waiter rolled his eyes at the amount of rubbish they had left behind.</p>
<p>Asian woman, refined and serious. He can't believe he is with such an amazing and refined and strong woman. She nods and has napkin over her stockings and skirt, Hair is made up, and white beautiful breathable shirt.  Laughs considerately, and feet bent exactly the same way, to be acceptable to be viewed from any angle.
It was a unique look in the cafe, but on a global scale, this look was mainly occupied by those </p>
<p>The others were all sitting around the table and looking at their phones, scrolling through important messages and important ads and important facebook updates.</p>
<p>A man sits back by himself and writes, he is writing about a story he thought up in his head over the length of his lifetime and is pumping it out like pee, he is so focused and concentrated that the world around him has stopped moving, and the more he  talks, the more his ego grows. If the tables were measured in size of ego, he is the quietest and no body sees him, but his ego would be bigger than the area of the cafe, consuming everything. But the irony was that if anyone brought a pin over and poked it slightly, it would pop and disappear, and his big dream would disappear. Ego could be built anywhere, as long as you kept to yourself.</p>
<p>The waiter notices him, he was a regular now, coming all the time and sitting by himself and moving his fingers into the computer, sinking his time into a void and coming out with an enlarged ego. No one knew what he was doing, but he seemed happy with it, it was an easy purchase of ego.</p>
<p>“How are you mate?” the waiter said.</p>
<p>“Thank you” the man looked around shyly, slightly covering his computer screen in the process. The waiter was too bored of work to be offended, he smiled, promising himself to ask the same question tomorrow. The first time he heard the man speak was when he stood up because he hadn't received the banner. Then the waiter told him that that was a huge deal, oh no,they were so busy, how was he going to solve it? The writer laughed momentarily and went back to his screen. Teh waiter collected more empty glasses from empty tables.</p>
<p>“Have you seen anything out of the ordinary?” One of the waiters came up and asked him.</p>
<p>“No, why?”</p>
<p>“The back door was unlocked, you haven't noticed anything missing?” He had his posture straight and his suit was stuck to his back like a kite. </p>
<p>“No one's going to steal anything, a coffee?” The waiter said</p>
<p>The other waiter nodded and went off to do the rest of whatever he was doing. When the day came to a close and they closed the cafe at five o clock, he stripped out of his uniform and walked to his room. All the dorm rooms were nearby here, so it was easy access. He went to the back and looked around, he made sure no one was around as he unlocked the back door, flicking the end of it with his finger. He didn't double check it, he knew the cameras were on. </p>
<p>He went back to the counter and sat down, pretending to drink a coffee. Then after five minutes he went out. An hour later, the sun was lower and redder, the clouds were dminishing on the hilltops. Then the door opened, a hand was on the end, and smooth polished black shoes.</p>
<p>The man went through the cafe and straight to the coffee machine. He found a message left for him underneath it. Inside the paper was a small card wrapped up, he took the card and went back out the cafe.</p>
<p>Things were always moving, things were always changing, yet the time never stopped marching forward. He looked up at the clock, it was 6 o clock. Dinner was being presented in Staff Dining, in the lounge, people were using the internet.</p>
<p>But he craned his neck up and looked, at the very top of this building, a treasure was glowing.</p>
<p>Soon he would have it.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twelve-the-perfect-day-is-falling-into-place">twelve: The perfect day is falling into place</h3>
<p>On her next day off Melanie was invited to dinner with Misty. Since Misty was sharing a room with  another girl, she was doing some baking in her mutual friend Livvy's place. </p>
<p>“It's our generation” Misty said, after they shared warm greetings. Melanie wasn't sure how she should dress for the occasion, but she saw that Misty was only wearing some casual clothes. When she walked in the kitchen, Livvy was standing and peeling some apples.</p>
<p>They greeted each other as well.
Then Misty and Livvy continued the conversation they had been having. Melanie stood on the side, at first it was fine, but then it started to grow awkward. She felt like she was intruding on their private conversation together. Misty always talked about Livvy. Livvy was tall and wore short shorts that accentuated her legs. But here there was never much need to show anyone anything, so Melanie wondered why she was wearing these shorts.</p>
<p>“They're always talking about their relationship” Misty said, as soon as she got back to the coutner.</p>
<p>“Are you in a relationship?” Melanie asked. She stopped their conversation dead still in its tracks.</p>
<p>“No, but I'm not looking for one, I'm happy like this” Then she was talking to Livvy again, “If you have a perfect relationship then you don't really need to talk about it right?”</p>
<p>Livvy nodded, she put an apple down and took the next, they both had a diminishing pile of apples, and Melanie was hopeful that the conversation would change when they finished the apples.</p>
<p>“What do you do?” Melanie said, she was glad to be able to talk to someone, about anything, “Sorry, I work at night so I never really see anyone, I just zip in to breakfast and zip back out”</p>
<p>“I open the store” Misty said. “And I used to be a supervisor, so Black trusts me a lot” She stopped peeling the apple, the peeler was on the counter like a colored safety pin amidst a sea of domesticity. When she looked up at Melanie it was with generosity. “Sorry, I forgot to tell you we're making apple crumble, do you like apple crumble?”</p>
<p>“Sure” Melanie smiled, she picked up the peeler that Misty gave her, and Misty moved away and sat down at the table. Melanie and Livvy were peeling together for a while, then Livvy lost the plot and also moved to the table.</p>
<p>“You're doing a good job” she wiped her hands on the handcloth hanging beneath the sink and turned and looked over Melanie's shoulder. “Yeah, really good”</p>
<p>The two sat at the table and continued the conversation, “Those two, Emma and Cameron, I swear they can't keep it to themselves, like hello, everyone's here, we just want peace and quiet. I mean the other day at staff dining...” </p>
<p>“It's nice though” Melanie said, “To have someone you can be so close with”</p>
<p>“It's nice” Misty said, she nodded afterwards, like she was remembering something, “But they're the msot insecure people you will know. They're inseparable and have to be with each other all the time.”</p>
<p>“This hotel is weird” she said, “It's almost like if you don't have a job you can't stay here or something”</p>
<p>“Not true, you can pay money and stay here” Livvy said.</p>
<p>“That's why I said almost, as in not really, but almost? Almost almost almost!” Misty was emphatic, and Livvy laughed, and Melanie had no idea what was happening, what was so funny? Wasn't that just plain Rude? With a capitla 'R'</p>
<p>Then a disgruntled sound came through, and a large dinosaur popped his head in. “I'm sure you ladies have seen my lightsaber” he said.</p>
<p>“No Tony, how many times do I have to tell you not to wear that costume around the house”</p>
<p>The Dinosaur was probably a T-rex, with some blank tiny arms hanging off the front. He took his head piece off and a little kid looked back curiously.</p>
<p>“That was Tony” Misty gestured, “Livvy's son”</p>
<p>Melanie looked at Livvy, she had a son? Their ages couldn't be too different. But their life roles were so different</p>
<p>Outside the house were five people, they were all aligned with each other. And they watched as Melanie left. She made an excuse to go, but as she was leaving they stood aside and let her pass. They had huge backpacks which made them travel far away. And when she looked at them she saw weapons sticking out of their packs. And she knew it was bad news. This was how people smuggled weapons into the village. They moved to the left when they saw Melanie approaching, and after she passed they politely moved back into the middle of the path and went on. They were heading up one of the mountains. </p>
<p>One of the high ones with snow covering the top.</p>
<p>Melanie looked back and she grew anxious to see them furtehr and further away. But she didn't say anything, because that wasn't right in itself.</p>
<p>Lleana sat at her desk on the second floor of administration. She did not have much work today, she decided. And she did not have to say anything to anyone, so she invited her close friend over. This woman was, Delilah, about her age, but twice as loud and twice as hasty. They had similar jobs, so they could bond over all sorts of common subjects.</p>
<p>Delilah had a passive-aggressive streak, as far as everyone else around her believed, she was never upset, and she was always friendly. But that was because she just ignored things or fell silent whenever she disagreed. She was passively disagreeing to it. So when Lleana invited her to the cafe, but she actually had some work she wanted to finish, she silently followed Lleana.</p>
<p>And at the table, when Lleana was describing what happened at home, and the man she met online, she thought Delilah was unresponsive because Delilah was simply that way. But Delilah was late from coming back from the bathroom, and she ate her food fast, and looked around a lot. Lleana didn't catch the unconscious signs of Delilah's body language. </p>
<p>Later, at night, when Delilah thought back to it, it was because she was upset at everything that was happening, and she was unconsciously not wanting to be there. She lay in bed and thought about this, while Lleana was fast asleep, and had been so for the past thirty minutes.</p>
<p>The tables in the cafe were beginning to be occupied. Lleana checked her watch to make sure it wasn't half past one, there was a new staff member arriving today. She talked to Delilah and was glad someone could relate to her so well. But she also had a back-up of all sorts of different friends who she didn't talk about. If Delilah were to refuse company, then she would have back-ups, that was what she meant.</p>
<p>Delilah was listening to Lleana and staring into space. She thought about how people everywhere were saying their own things and what pleased them. Actually it didn't really matter to them.</p>
<p>Then the waiter came up to them. “Did you guys hear about the guys who tried to climb the highest peak here?”</p>
<p>Lleana shook her head. Delilah shook her head. </p>
<p>“There were five of them, with all sorts of gear, but they all fell off when a crevasse collapsed. Apparently it's the biggest accident the mountain has seen this year.”</p>
<p>Everyone sighed and looked at each other. Delilah had woken up from her long slumber for what seemed like the first time. “Have you heard the saying, weaklings live by the law, strong men make the laws.” she said, “Well, these men were too arrogant, that's what I think”</p>
<p>Every year the mountain claimed lives, but people kept on going up it and trying to conquer it. She saw it as men's foolishness for something called ego. </p>
<p>“And” the waiter looked around, “I think the back door is broken, it doesn't lock properly” Lleana sighed, </p>
<p>“So you want me to file a maintenance report?”</p>
<p>“If you could” The waiter smiled, “You see how busy I am.” He looked around the cafe, and when he was clear he smiled again, pouring more water in the ladies' glasses. “I'm sure someone's been using the back door to walk in here”</p>
<p>“Yes I'm sure” Lleana rolled her eyes, “To come and steal the coffee right?”</p>
<p>“Haha” they all laughed. “William hasn't slept in three days”</p>
<p>“But William wouldn't steal anything” Jeena said. “He isn't that type of person, I think”</p>
<p>They laughed some more. “Of course not, don't take it so seriously”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirteen-management-moves">thirteen: Management moves</h3>
<p>The GM called a meeting with the vice-GM, which also meant that he was the second man in charge of the hotel. He was a man of Chinese descent called Mr. Cheng, his accent was a natural and his cultural awareness was precinct. Those who knew him well joked that he had a good phone voice. Those who didn't know him well made the same joke, but not to his face.</p>
<p>He was short, but what he lacked in height he made up for in ferocity. He always wore a woolen cardigan over a dark suit. But people looked at his suits and thought it was something normal. Unlike the other members of management, he came to staff dining regularly, it combined his passion of food with bossing people around.</p>
<p>But one time he came in to staff dining and saw a man dining in the corner. He sat down next to him and realized that they shared the same mental illness. The same disorder, and rhis disorder was so rare that he felt like he could relate to this person and trust him. </p>
<p>To him, trust wasn't something absolute or solid, it was just an connection of compatibility. And for professional reasons he couldn't support this man, but to himself he knew he would support him. “To me, he is trustworthy!” he said once he left, and grinned to himself and got back into his work.</p>
<p>When he got home to his wife, she had a warm dinner awaiting him. It was on the table and warm. But he looked past it and at her. “You know Black” he said, “He's our retail store manager, and he wants to make a big Youtube video promoting our hotel.”</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me this, is this the first thing you say when you come home to your wife?”</p>
<p>“Because I want you to be in the video” Mr. Cheng undid his tie, “Wouldn't that be nice? And it's going to be a big affair” </p>
<p>Mrs. Cheng had long been living in her husband's dreams, and so far there were no problems, she went along with him well. </p>
<p>“Okay” she said, taking his tie, “But you have to eat your dinner first” She sat her husband down, he turned as he continued talking to her, and she smield and laughed. “Good, keep talking, tell me everything” she said.</p>
<p>At around the same time, the retail store manager was also home. Most of the day he spent working around by himself, and no one knew what he did, and he didn't want them to. He got his work done privately. He had been recently married to a woman who was more mature than he was, but he kept that up and went on. </p>
<p>When he got home, his wife was out, she had gone out to the bar with the girlfriends, he sat down at the table and fell into deep thinking. He wanted to make the store the biggest and most important store in this part of the country. And it would promote the hotel as well, that was what he would tell his boss.</p>
<p>Youtube was the key, and he was excited to tell his wife about it and laugehd to himself.</p>
<p>An hour later his wife returned, “Are you serious about this?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” He crossed his arms in control.</p>
<p>“It's the worst idea I've ever heard from you”</p>
<p>“What?” Black leaned forward in his chair, then stood up. “Why are you saying that kind of thing? I thought you always supported me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but not with something foolish like this”</p>
<p>“I already told Mr. Cheng” he said. </p>
<p>Mrs. Black respected her husband, she kenw he was good at his job, he was promoted quickly, but now he was at the dead end of his job, there was nothing higher. And because of that she knew he was going to risk things to push higher, and it was her job as his wife to keep him safe. She knew he would only regret it afterwards.</p>
<p>“Look at yourself” she said. Her voice had dropped, and all of her smiling from the abr just ten minutes ago had disappeared. She put her handbag down and stood in front of Black, touching his collar, adjusting it to look proper. “You're a retail store manager, you're not some Youtube star. You've put on 10 kg's since we got married, and you hardly exercise anymore.”</p>
<p>These weren't harsh words, everyone had been telling Black the same thing for the past year, it was just one of those changes that everyone noticed. But no one told him, only Black's wife. And she held the responbility and embarrassment of whatever her hsuband did. </p>
<p>“Your son, your wife, your parents, everyone's telling you the same thing, just settle and relax, you don't need to advance anymore, why don't we do something together, go somewhere together?”</p>
<p>“Tell me what?” Black said. “None of you believe me, I've got a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Everyone's telling you, everyone knows it, they can see it clearly, but you're the only one who doesn't.”</p>
<p>That night, it finally clicked with Black. Everyone's opinions began to weigh him down, and he felt the vitality drain through him to someone else. He had held on for long enough. A few mouseclicks later he was looking at the video he loved, of a hotel promoting its avenues it held in warrant.</p>
<p>If anyone walked into the room several minutes later they would have seen Black crying, one hand rubbing his eyes while he saw something so familiar that it made him cry. It was something that only he saw in the video, a dream that was so close, but being shredded apart by all sorts of meaningless details. He didn't know it yet, but it was a human seeing another frail thing and being so touched and crying. He was a petty person, sees another thing happen to someone he barely knows and it was so familiar to him that he cried. It was the first time he ever showed this weakness to himself. And it would be the alst.</p>
<p>The store was his, he would not let anyone take it. </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fourteen-the-second-meeting-and-where-things-become-a-little-more-clear">fourteen: The second meeting, and where things become a little more clear</h3>
<p>There was a cleaning sign outside one of the meeting rooms. Six people were gathered inside.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy raised his hand, “I just heard today that the retail store manager Black, hes the half adopted brother of the GM.”</p>
<p>“That's the connection” Mr. Angry said, “I didn't realize it, but I knew there had to be something between them keeping everything”</p>
<p>“Keeping everything?” Mr. Danger said. “The two are completely different, the GM is always working and never jokes, he's always talking just for professional rapport”</p>
<p>“And Black wants to be more like him, that's why he does all of the things he does” Mr. Angry said, “Don't worry everyone, the final piece of this has fallen into place, now we can start to unravel this heist”</p>
<p>He spread out the papers on the floor, there were details of everything, and each person had their own papers named. </p>
<p>“Take your papers and memorize everything on them, every single line and squiggle, nothing is on there that I haven't left for you”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox leaned over and looked around at everyone else's, her hair was caught in it. And it was becoming annoying to everyone. </p>
<p>“Move your hair Annalise” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“Stop saying my name” Annalise grunted and pushed Gerry. </p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox, Mr. Danger, stop” Mr. Angry's tone was so serious. He showed the gun he had. “You guys better be quiet” </p>
<p>“If you blow that thing it's going to be louder than us” Mr. Chatterbox said. “Besides, are we going to talk about this at all? Are we going to find out how this whole thing works?” He spoke like it was a factory procedure.</p>
<p>“There's no need for pointless discussion” Mr. Purple said. “Just do your job and go out.”</p>
<p>“What if it all goes horribly wrong, I don't trust this guy.” Mr. Chatterbox pointed at Mr. Angry, “We don't have any discussion and just have to blindly listen to this piece of paper.”</p>
<p>“It's follow” Mr. Melancholy said, “You can't listen to a piece of paper”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox gave him a dirty glare, “Look, I just want to know I'm going to be safe, and at the end I'm going to get my cut.” She spread out her paper, “You guys have no idea what I have to do do you? I have to hold a gun and kill the guard if he turns the corner” she read the paper, “It says I'm on the third floor and if a guard comes around the corner I have to shoot him with no hesitation. Just hold the gun up against his head and shoot him in between the eyebrows, push him against the wall with your right leg and dash back out of sight.”</p>
<p>She threw the paper down, “I don't even know why, why do I have to do this? Am I being polite now? What if he has a monobrow? Then where do I shoot?” </p>
<p>Mr. Angry shook his head. “I don't think you heard me, it's going to be fine. That part is a just in case. I warned you when you signed up that you might have to kill, it's not an ideal outcome, but in order to protect ourselves we have to, it's inevitable. Every company has a crisis policy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox shook her head, “If you want me to kill someone, if you want me to even do so much as touch anyone for you, you're going to have to give me a damn good reason”</p>
<p>“I just GAVE you a fucking good reason, the only reason you ever need” Mr. Angry's face was turning red. “I spent three years thinking of every single motherFUCKING possibility, did you sit down for one fucking second and use that puny brain of yours to get past the idea of raising a gun?”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox fell silent, she pushed her hair back and sat down, like she had nothing to do with it, like it wasn't her fault this man was upset.</p>
<p>“Anyone. Any other one of you dirty, disgusting, filthy greedy vampire bastards, Have. Any. Questions.”</p>
<p>“I think we can go through the heist together, so we can cover for each other” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry grunted, “For one last time, we will NOT discuss the job, you have NO need to know what the others are doing, how slack their task is, or how difficult and cruel the task is, it's none of your business. The only task here is to get the treasure.” He sighed, it was past anger, now it was disappointment, “You have to trust me that what I have done is in the best interests of everyone.”</p>
<p>No one replied, Mr. Angry's fists were clenched, they were cocked in front of Mr. Lazy's face. “You must not talk about your actions outside of our meeting rooms, nowhere else. Just focus on your own lives and improving yourselves for this one task, that's all you need to do. Take these sheets home and study them, memorize them, burn them to the back of those tiny brains of yours and practice them until they're perfect. You know, as the Chinese say, and we can all learn from the Chinese, Practice makes Perfect. That's what Confucious said.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox sighed, suddenly Daniel was all Confucius and Buddhism and Daoism like it was a fashion. He was conflicted, he kept contradicting himself, she didn't know what to believe about him anymore. She regretted joining this illegal group, they were bound to be caught, she deeply felt it.</p>
<p>A hand was raised, it stood tall like a tower amidst all sorts of people looking towards the hand. It belonged to Mr. Chatterbox, who was still sitting rebelliously in the corner. She had her hand raised just for the sake of raising it to infuriate Mr. Angry, and he knew it.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry unclenched his fist and told them all what he was thinking. That someone should throw a toilet roll onto her raised hand. And Mr. Chatterbox's hand was raised so straight and so straightforwardly that it was an enticing target for daring young men. Mr.Lazy grabbed a toilet roll core and threw it, it landed on her arm and travelled down. The guys cheered.</p>
<p>“I don't want to be called Mrs. Chatterbox” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I find it insulting that the men get their own ones, but it's misogynistic to say a female woman is a chatterbox”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry thought about it, his finger was on his lips and he frowned. “You're Mr. Chatterbox because I said you are” he finally spoke, and when he did, Mr. Chatterbox wasn't happy.</p>
<p>“I want to be Mrs. Pretty, or Mrs. Beautiful, either of those would suit me.”</p>
<p>The guys laughed, she glared at them. “Or Mrs. Sexy, that one's fine as well”</p>
<p>The human condition only has a few actions, these are repeated processes we see everyday. But these actions are determined by complicated and well-thought-out-and-defined thought processes. There could be a thousand reasons for not using a condom, or eating veggies at night, or closing the toilet lid, every small decision has a network of subconscious processes running backstage. Despite being the same action, they vary on different reasons and the result and how things will turn out. In this meeting, no-one had quite figured it out yet, but there was a reason that their names were set to who they were, Mr. Angry didn't even know it himself, but it was an importance that he sensed, and he denied any change to this with a dreadful urgency. “We're not changing any names, your names fit who you are, I'm not sure of why yet, but I think the reason will come clear.” It was an artists instinct, a foresight of something very vague.</p>
<p>And so he ignored Mr. Chatterbox's inquiry, “If there's anything I want you to know, with the right uniform you can get in any door. It's that simple, in your individual blueprints you'll find what kind of uniform will lead you in where.” Mr. Angry touched the wall and suddenly left the room, he didnt' hesitate, he didn't show any sense of warning or urgency, he turned aside and left.</p>
<p>The others watched him leave, he was so unpredictably spontaneous, they didn't know what he was going to be doing the next moment, everytime they me thim he was different, sometimes calm and tranquil, sometimes angry, sometimes caring and compassionate. But he was always unpredictable.</p>
<p>The other five were left wondering what just happened. They wanted to discuss it, but they had to read over the plan first. </p>
<p>“I guess I'll see you guys at the next meeting” Mr. Lazy was already out the door, he traield Mr. Angry wherever he went, Mr. Purple resented him for that. Couldn't he stand up for himself?</p>
<p>“You better not tell anyone” Mr. Melancholy stepped aside and let one of the ladies past, he watched Mr. Purples's butt bounce out and nodded to Mr. Danger. The ladies walked past and up different flights of stairs formally. Mr. Purple put her hands beside her thighs to stop her skirt from rising too high.</p>
<p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fifteen-william-charlotte">fifteen: William &amp; Charlotte</h3>
<p>Charlotte took a long breath of her cigarette, she looked up at the stars, they got clouded by the smoke she breathed out, then reappeared one by one above her. For some reason she smoked here, a lot, but back home with her parents she didn't smoke at all, and she didn't joke around as much. She didn't know why there was a difference, but she noticed it. The hotel was crowded, people were everywhere, but beyond the staff-only doors it was quiet. There was no-one around, none of the customers ventured past the doors. And people all talked about things.</p>
<p>She held the cigarette with two fingers, holding it beside her lips, the lights around her lit her up like tiny spotlights that weren't big enough to cause any real commotion. She knew that she wanted to go to the city, if she could afford it. There were no decent jobs there, and rent costed a fortune, otherwise she wouldn't be working in a useless place like this. There were hardly any people here, and nothing to do. The first excitement she felt was meeting that new guy, William.</p>
<p>As she thought about him, the staff door turned purple and the ground was green, and it looked like some scene from a fantasy. Charlotte dropped the cigaretter butt on the floor and lowered her head, looking at it like a maniac. She stamped on it suddenly, wondering what was happening. Why was she working here, what was she doing here? She wanted out. Then before she knew it, people everywhere were telling her different things. She just wanted someone to tell her how to live her life, that was all she wanted. The only thing in the world she wanted.</p>
<p>She stood up and kicked her shoes back over her heels. With the left side half on she stopped, there was someone in front of her, a figure moving slowly. He had the silhouette of William, and his steps moved like him as well. She sat down and watched as William walked to her, enjoying his tentative gestures. She took out another cigarette and held it between her teeth without lighting it. </p>
<p>Slowly William was in front of her, he sat down silently, in a mutal understanding that Charlotte wanted him there. </p>
<p>“You finished work already?” he said.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with you life?” Charlotte said, “Why did you choose to come to this shithole place where nothing is changing and everyone is always talking about the same rubbish”</p>
<p>“It's the last day of the year” William said, “It's December 31, the year's already asleep, in a few hours we'll be dawning on a new age. Can we not discuss this today?”</p>
<p>“You're a fricken loser” Charlotte showed off her lighter and lit it. She gazed at the flame for a while, William wondered what she was looking at. “There's only three reasons I can think of that you would come here”</p>
<p>William waited silently for her speculations</p>
<p>“You're a loser and you can't get a job in the city” she said. She raised a finger, “You hate the city and came here”</p>
<p>“Or else what's the third?” William said.</p>
<p>“You came here because you really really like me” Charlotte laughed at her own desperation, she wasn't supposed to say that out loud. Now he would be dismayed.</p>
<p>“So, what is it?” she said when he didn't answer, he was grinning in his corner without informing her of anything. </p>
<p>“It's because I like you” William said, “Charlotte, I love you, you're the most amazing woman I've ever met, I can't believe someone like you would even pay attention to me”</p>
<p>Now Charlotte's heart started pounding, it twisted in a silent struggle to break free of her body and grab him. She reached out and put her fingers over a place where only a few women had touched.</p>
<p>“Don't touch me there” William said. </p>
<p>She immediately removed her hand and used it to take the cigarette out of her mouth, for no apparent reason other than to distract him.</p>
<p>“Are you embarrassed?” she said, “Do you not like me?” She looked down at the ground, flicking ashes onto the ground, they dove off the butt like skydivers, disappearing in the cold night air together, all doing the same thing. “I feel like you haven't accepted me fully yet?”</p>
<p>William shook his head, “I'm not a guy who you would want to get involved with. Trust me Charlotte”</p>
<p>Now she was confused, he had already slept with her and was now pulling away. Had she made a mistake in allowing him to visit her most sacred temple, the sanctuary of her fruit? “Why did you sleep with me? Were you just playing?”</p>
<p>“There's a lot of me” William said, “One is the quiet me who's at work and thinking about things and minding my own business. Never stepping out of line.”</p>
<p>Charlotte nodded, “I know, I saw you at work when I went to deliver something to you guys, and you're like a different person”</p>
<p>“Another me is the one you see who is really lusty and talking to you in beautiful ways, singing of beautiful things and attracting you to me, so he can bury himself in you. He's always desperate and needy”</p>
<p>“What's wrong with you? Why do you feel the need to do that, why don't you just change yourself” All of a sudden Charlotte felt really sorry for him, she forgot about the cigarette and scooted towards William, trying to get closer. In his pain she felt empathy.</p>
<p>“Don't say that, it's really offensive, it's not like it's my choice. My lfie conditions make me think and feel this way. Naturally if something happens to someone, then they start to feel and think in predictable ways towards this.” </p>
<p>“Am I not attractive enough?” she said, there was fear in her voice, because she knew that if he said  'yes', she wouldn't be able to handle it. It would tear her confidence apart into shreds that blew away down a bridge into a wide river.</p>
<p>“It's because I have things I need to do.” William breathed in deeply, “But there's another me who's coming out recently, and all he touches is destroyed, he is like a curious child who touches everythign he sees and plays with it, even though he is told not to. Then he touches it, and it breaks into sand, it's always the same, no matteer how solid or hard or smooth and confident it looks, it always breaks away into the same dull brown sand, small pebbles the size of your snot, and it crumbles away without any chance of being repaired.”</p>
<p>Charlotte nodded, “And then?” William wasn't sure if she was really fascinated, or just listening to him because she knew he wanted to be heard, either way he went on.</p>
<p>“And then when it breaks away he always gets the same reaction, the inner tranquility has expired and out erupts a voluptuous rage, something that wants to destroy everything completely. To rip the world apart and throw chunks of the earth in every direction. To burn cities and listen to the sound of acid rain melting everything.</p>
<p>“That's not healthy thinking” Charlotte said. They both became quiet, Charlotte was staring at William, and she decided she knew what she wanted to say, “I really think you need help, can I help you? Is there something I can do?”</p>
<p>“I was just telling you my life sincerely, and now you're scared aren't you? That's why I don't tell people what I really thinka dn feel, because it makes them uncomfortable. He was using the third person, as if Charlotte was everyone else, she heard that and felt like she was just another girl to him. Even when she offered him her body and her love and eveything, he didn't see it, like the wrapper around candy, it wasn't important.</p>
<p>“Let me support you” she whispered it at first, because she was afraid of what he would think, would he be annoyed? “Good luck in solving these problems”</p>
<p>“Luck?” he said, “I don't need fucking luck, I'm in control of my life, luck isn't going to do anything, if I want it to happen it happens, and if I don't want it to, it won't.”</p>
<p>“Okay, well sorry, I mean, try your best okay?”</p>
<p>William didn't respond, this was his cue, Charlotte was waiting for him to say something, so she could continue this.</p>
<p>“It's just sex though, I don't think there's any reason for you to leave, right?” Charlotte was practically begging now. “What do you need to do?” She didn't understand why he was running away, did she do something wrong to scare him off? Was it something she said, was it because she was smoking, maybe he didn't like girls who smoked.</p>
<p>“I'm working on a big project with some friends” he said. “I think it's going to change me for the better”</p>
<p>“I don't understand what that's got to do with us?” </p>
<p>“What is it you want?” he said. “Do you want to moan, is that it?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, she didn't know exactly, but she knew it wasn't that.</p>
<p>“If you want to moan, you can find any other guy to make you moan”</p>
<p>“You're such an idiot, you have no respect for me, why do you have to make me say it? I want you to make me moan, I don't care about any other guy any more, when you started treating me really kind, then I became your girlfriend and you became my boyfriend”</p>
<p>“You're mine?” William had never asked for this, he was just being kind.</p>
<p>“I mean, I'm not yours, but you get what I mean?”</p>
<p>“Not really” William said, “We've only known each other for two weeks, and you're becoming so clingy, seriously, get a hold of yourself or I'm not interested.” He took a step back, then another, and another. “I think we should spend some time apart. I'm not your boyfriend, and you're certianly not mu girlfriend, we just had a happy time together, and we can keep on spending time like that, but it's not going anywhere okay?”</p>
<p>“What is this even?” she exclaimed, “What kind of relationship do we have? It's so fucking ambiguous, it's like two babies who haven't learned to speak yet are making faces to each other.”</p>
<p>“That's an interesting way of putting it” William said. He suddenly was interested.</p>
<p>“No, it's not, stop changing the subject, I have feelings for you so hurry up and take them. I don't want to wait around, I've spent too long thinking about you already”</p>
<p>“You're so pushy, control yourself” He didn't even take her seriously, even when she was calm, even when she was angry.</p>
<p>Then Charlotte realized she had tears in her eyes, even when she spoke her heart it didn't seem to make a difference, he just kept speaking in the same tone, despising her. He lived in his own world, and nothing she said would change him. He came to her when he liked, and he left her when he liked, it was all on his terms, and she coudlnt' keep up with it. She had to keep wondering when the next time would be.</p>
<p>“Take me” she said. “One last time before we never speak to each other again. I don't care anymore. I'm tired of worrying if you like me or don't like me, I'm tired of wondering if your feelings will change and flow towards me, I'm tired of thinking about all of your complicated self obsessed shit. Right now, all I want is for you to stick your cock in me and do me hard.”</p>
<p>William's eyes widened, her tone struck him like a dissonant chord in Mozart. She grabbed his hand all the way to her room, they collapsed on the bed as one body for five whole minutes. William heaved and rolled over, Charlotte emerged, panting underneath his body like a small heart. He was so slim that his ribs showed. Was this what she wanted?</p>
<p>“At least have the respect to thank me” William said.</p>
<p>“I reckon you are going to find another girl who';s younger than me and prettier than me. And be drinking and chatting, sitting and chatting, standing and chatting with her, that's how you'll get to know her”</p>
<p>William sat up but Charlotte pulled him back down with her slender arms. “Don't go yet” she said. She made him roll over next to her and they stared into each other's eyes.</p>
<p>“I'm really embarrassed about this okay?” William said. </p>
<p>Charlotte looked away to the top right, so suddenly he was Mr. Sensitive...</p>
<p>“Don't be embarassed okay? You have me” she brushed his forehead with the back of her fingers.</p>
<p>“I mean, if others found out...I don't know what they'd say”</p>
<p>“It's not that weird right?” Charlotte smiled, “Everyone does it”</p>
<p>William looked away, “I'd like it if we kept this a secret”</p>
<p>“You don't want anyone to know?” Charlotte said, “Are you ashamed of being with me?”</p>
<p>She didn't wait for the answer, she knew the moment she asked what the answer was, so instead she asked him why. “What do you have to do that is more important than the other people around you?”</p>
<p>“I have a big dream” he said.</p>
<p>“Well, what is it?” Charlotte felt like she deserved to know. After all of this, she didn't even know why he had to leave her.</p>
<p>“It's vague” he said, “It's so big that it's vague. I just want to do something grand and memorable, so that people will see me”</p>
<p>“But I see you” Charlotte said, “And so do a lot of others in the hotel, you're popular, everyone's talking about you.”</p>
<p>“I want more” he said. “I don't know how much, but more, always more, more, and more”</p>
<p>“Then what are you going to do?” Charlotte said, “To achieve this from now on? What's your plan? It sounds so vague.”</p>
<p>“I just said it was vague. And it's none of your business.” He said the next part outright, “There's no place in it for you”</p>
<p>“You know, that's a really rude thing to say, a human should never say that to someone else who cares about them enough to ask. I'm asking you because I care about you, caring for someone is the best thing one human can do for another, and caring for everyone is the most beautiful thing. That's like you're asking me not to be a human anymore.” She scrunched up her cheeks, looking five years younger, and like a squirrel. “I want to be a human” </p>
<p>William swallowed loudly, she had hit his nervousness, and she kept on at it, “One day, you're going to regret it, because no one will care about you enough to ask, or take care of you, I hope you realize that.” Now he was under her control, she knew she had struck a chord of fear in him, and she was telling the truth, but she also enjoyed the power that she exerted over him right now. “I realized that I've liked you for a while now, and I'm sorry, I shouldn't be saying this, it's probably a nuisance to you anyway, but let me say it okay? for my own pleasure.”</p>
<p>“I like you William, and it's so storng that it might even become...love.”</p>
<p>She smiled, it was so forced, and it was the hardest smile she had managed, but she pulled it off, “You can take what I said and do whatever you want with it, throw it away or whatever, but just don't forget that I really mean this when I say it, and look at me, even though it's useless and I look pathetic, I'm still saying it. So be honest with yourself okay?”</p>
<p>William was being honest with himself, he didn't want to be with her, he didn't know how he could be more honest. He just didn't know how he got himself into this, she was so emotionally involved already, he thought she was a little hot and approached her, and now he couldn't break away, and breaking away was accompanied by feelings of sadness and guilt and rejection. Every look she sent him was sending ropes that were tying him up tighter and tighter until his balls were going to fall off.</p>
<p>Why did these feelings flow, to him and to her; was he in the wrong or was she in the wrong? Or was there something else deeper going on that somehow just pulled two people apart, or strung so many strings of feelings together. Something beyond two people that was controlling everything.</p>
<p>William got out of bed and pulled his clothes over himself like a hard earned drink of water. He looked back before leaving, “Bye” he said awkwardly, half out of politeness and half out of affect.</p>
<p>Charlotte waved back friendly, a really kind smile as well, “Bye William, I'll see you around work and stuff so we're all good, this place is small anyway” </p>
<p>And when he was gone she cried, at first silently while he was walking down the corridor. By the time he was back in his room she was bawling into the pillow. </p>
<p>It took about ten thousand hours of romance, or joy and heartbreak before one really became good at romance, at feelings, and at understanding and expressing. Charlotte frimly believed that, but she was still in pain, so much. </p>
<p>Each tear she shed was glue to repair her broken heart. Even though she was sad, and she was struggling, like so many other times, and she had to go through all of this to help herself, and it seemed like he didn't care at all and she was suffering by herself. She knew she would eventually move on, and then she would grow from it as a person, and maybe the next person would be the one.</p>
<p>Whereas William may never grow.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sixteen-annalise-is-mr-chatterbox">sixteen: Annalise is Mr. Chatterbox</h3>
<p>There was a knock at the door, then it opened, a slender hand was holding a band of toothpaste.</p>
<p>“I feel like he's just putting on this big act, and trying to scare and manipulate us” Annalise said, as soon as Misty appeared. She had been waiting to tell someone this information. </p>
<p>The someone was usually Misty. She knew it. </p>
<p>“Yeah, he's like a control freak, but it's weird because he's not like that at work at all, he's actually really tame” </p>
<p>Apparently, she had been thinking about it as well.</p>
<p>They were both talking about William, recently Annalise had always been talking about the new boy William Weng, and she was giving Misty updates on her issues and joys, on possibilities and regrets, and most of all, to compare and contrast different points about him with another person.</p>
<p>Misty immediately lay down on her bed, she slowly pulled the covers over herself and bundled into a ball, cuddling her legs and wriggling her toes. “Okay, I'm ready to listen”</p>
<p>“You're so hopeless” Annalise walked over ot the bed and stood above her. “You have to lie in bed as soon as you get home?”</p>
<p>“Because it's so comfortable, and I'm tired”</p>
<p>“You know, you sound like you're depressed, my uncle was depressed”</p>
<p>“We're not talking about you uncle, tell me your story with William”</p>
<p>“Okay” Annalise sat down, “Here it goes”</p>
<p>Misty was under the covers listening to Annalise's voice, it was so mesmerzing that she saw bubbles float up in different colours and popping when they hit her hand, and her clothes sparkled in the bright lights. In one of the bubbles it was William standing and staring at something whilst thinking very hard on a grass plain, right beside him a young woman approached, it was Annalise, and Misty started to feel envious, she wished there was someone beside her who would support her in everything she did.</p>
<p>“William was telling me about something big he was going to do, and apparently it's so big that no one can even touch upon it. And he's telling me this, and when I smile, he blushes. It's like he knows what I'm thinking, and then I blush” She kept speaking, like a windy day, the wind just kept blowing and blowing, stripping the world from its jewellery and going back to basics.</p>
<p>“He really respects my space, and shows a lot of consideration to me, I don't know how to put it, but I've never met a guy like him. And I'm pretty sure he likes me as well, because he told Jeena that he was always shy around me. But he still tries to keep talking to me.”</p>
<p>Misty felt like she was floating inside the mattress in a different world, absorbed in the comforts of Annalise's story. She really enjoyed listening to Annalise speak about her own life.</p>
<p>“Come on, you just finished work, can't you listen to me for once instead of getting all depressed?”</p>
<p>“I'm not depressed, it's just that I'm tired...and besides, I'm his supervisor, it's weird to talk about something like this when I've seen the other side of him.” Misty said.</p>
<p>“So you like...flipped him over like a pancake or something so you could see him?” </p>
<p>There was no response, so Annalise tried again “It was a joke”</p>
<p>Misty didn't move under the covers, she held herself well. “He's hot, I can see why you're infatuated with him” she said, “But at work today, and yesterday, and every single day I've known him for...” Annalise just watched Misty's voice come out of the covers like it was a podcast on her iPad. If it was, then she wanted to change the episode.</p>
<p>“I'm not infatuated” she said, “He genuinely might be the one, I calmly assessed the situation”</p>
<p>“You mean you were crying in bed when he didn't text you, and laughing out loud when things are going good? Yeah...that's infatuation Annalise”</p>
<p>“He's hot okay, I'll acknowledge that” (Speaks like Maya here, fast and flustery and excited and desperate?) “But that's not enough reason for someone like me to like him, I think it's more to do with how his whole attitude is, don't you think?”</p>
<p>There was no answer again, Annalise crossed her arms and sat down on Misty's bed. It was kind of hard to talk to an unmoving blanket. She wasn't even sure if Misty was listening. </p>
<p>Then Misty started laughing, and the blanket trembled up and down where Misty's chest was. “You're worried right now aren't you, that I'm not lsitening, and you were starting to feel awkward, I know”</p>
<p>Annalise had to laugh, she found herself smiling, they really were close friends.</p>
<p>Misty pulled the covers down slowly and her fingers appeared, then her head. She peered down at Annalise sitting on her bed. “I knew you'd be smiling, you smile whenever I make you feel awkward”</p>
<p>“Then don't make me feel awkward!”</p>
<p>“So you don't want to smile?”</p>
<p>“I do! I'm confused!”</p>
<p>“What are your talents Annalise?”</p>
<p>“What kind of question is that? Isn't that random?”</p>
<p>“I'm just curious, because it's probably got a lot to do with who you really start thinking a lot about.” Now Misty stopped, “Was it a weird question?”</p>
<p>“Well, if it's out of the blue, it's kind of arrogant and condescending?”</p>
<p>“I never knew a question could be arrogant”</p>
<p>“It's also condescending”</p>
<p>Misty finally became serious. “Annalise, don't take this the wrong way, I'm telling you because I'm your friend” Some people found it difficult to talk to Annalise, because she was so fast at speaking and had no filter, but Misty was so slow that they somehow clicked. She was proud to be able to connect with Annalise. But she didn't know how Annalsie felt about her, or if she even needed her.</p>
<p>“I won't take it the wrong way, but when you say it, it makes you sound like you don't know me well and we're strangers”</p>
<p>“Okay I'll just say it then, you're the type to be really needy in a relationship, you're constantly talking about the guy you like, and how he is the perfect one. But he doesn't talk about you at all.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?”</p>
<p>“I work with him, and today, the same as yesterday, and the day before that, and everyday he comes to work he's the same, he's got a bad attitude, he's disrespectful towards customers, and he works really slowly, half the time we actually have to cover for him”</p>
<p>“William?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“And he never talks about me? How do you know that? What does he talk about?”</p>
<p>“He's really quiet, like he's dreaming about something, and he's got a strange sense of humour, it's almost obscene or angry, I laugh because its funny, but it's also kind of weird how I find it funny”</p>
<p>“Like what did he say?” Annalise put her hand over Misty's, “You can tell me anything, what was the joke.”</p>
<p>“I do tell you everything Annalise, especially because you're like my best friend, I've never felt so happy to listen to someone's stories, or to their love life, and I've never felt so worried about how someone's life is going to go. I feel like I have a moral responsibility to tell you these things.”</p>
<p>Misty sat up, she folded the covers on the bed. “Look, I haven't lived my life much more than you have, I haven't had a boyfriend, I haven't kissed anyone, I'm practicing abstinence” She looked into Annalise her eyes, “And that may be rare in our culture, but it gives me a look, and I think William is up to something.”</p>
<p>Annalise scoffed, “Everyone's up to something, so what's the big deal, there's a strangeness, weirdness and something we can never show about everyone. Even though it shouldn't be like that, it is, and it just is.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I just get the feeling it's something really bad” Misty said, “I don't think you can trust him. I've met a lot of people, and some people you just instantly know, they give you a feeling.”</p>
<p>“What is he up to? Do you have any details?”</p>
<p>“I don't know, I just wouldn't go near him alone”</p>
<p>“He's fine” Annalise said, “He's one of the sweetest guys I know. But what's he like at work, you were telling me about that earlier”</p>
<p>“He's just like every other guy” Misty said, “He slept with Charlotte a few times already”</p>
<p>Annalsie froze, and Misty wondered why, the part Misty said earlier was more important, not about who he slept with. “He slept with Charlotte? Are you sure? How come I haven't heard about it?”</p>
<p>“Because it just happened, and it's been going on for a while”</p>
<p>Annalise couldn't get the image out of her mind, “You seriously mean this?” She was shocked, because William seemed like someone who was a really nice guy and woudlnt' do that kind of thing. And Charlotte as well, Annalsie greeted her everyday.</p>
<p>Now it was Misty's turn to put her hand over Annalise's, “Just be careful because us girls, we have so much affection for others. We easily give our hearts and love to anybody, but you have to make sure it's the right person” Misty said, “You can give and give and sometimes never see any fruit. You can labour all your life without tasting the fruits of your labour. And our affections are unique to us, without our feelings, the world would be a quiet place. So don't let it become like that for you okay?”</p>
<p>“I'm going to try my best with him” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“Even if he sleeps around?”</p>
<p>“I'm still going to try” Annalsie said, “I don't know any different anymore other than thinking about him. And I've thought about it, if we get together, then I can accept that. I might have to experience it myself as well though, to understand his view. And maybe I can get him to change for the better.”</p>
<p>“Men never change” Misty said, “Even boys hardly change, much less a man. At least that's a good thing, you know what you can get and what you're going to miss. I think us women try to change a man, to make him more reliable, or to make him nicer, or to make him more sincere with his emotions, every man has something that we want changed, but they're not faulty products in a supermarket line, some women treat men like they're all the one wrong product in the line and every other man would suffice. But I've been thinking about it, and love is a beautiful thing”</p>
<p>“By the way” Misty said, “I'm ready now”</p>
<p>“Ready for what?” Annalise smiled, she knew what was coming. Annalise had thought about the same thing years before, and she had loved it.</p>
<p>“Ready to love someone wholeheartedly.” Misty said, “Like you, and all the other girls have experienced before, I want to try it out now as well”</p>
<p>Annalise smiled, it looked like Misty was finally ready to experience the world. There was something fresh about knowing this.” </p>
<p>“But not William” Misty said. “Most men are nice, but not him, I wouldn't get too close to him”</p>
<p>“I know” </p>
<p>Misty slowly disappeared back under the covers into her own dream world, she brought the darkness to life with her whimsical ideas. Dancing figures, and historical enterprises, big legendary figures replaying their famous actions again and again.</p>
<p>Annalise couldnt' tell Misty about how else she knew William, and he looked really alive, not how he was at work. But at the couple of meetings they had together where she was Mr. Chatterbox and he was Mr. Melancholy. During those times William really respected Mr. Angry, and that was the thing he wanted to do.</p>
<p>If Misty was afraid about William's moral compass, at least Annalise and him were compatible. They were working on the same thing together. And it was this that gave her the most confidence that they could actually be together. But she couldn't tell Misty this.</p>
<p>She was also afraid that if she told Misty this, she might not be accepted as a friend any more. So she hid it away and only talked of the good things. And she didnt' say how she was doing it to try out a new thrill, taste of life. She didn't say how she was partly in it because she wanted to be with William. She didn't say she liked feeling responsible and important as Mr. Chatterbox. She didn't say how she had no morals to tell her what she was doing was wrong, even though she was raised being told to never steal. And she didn't say that Misty and her might only be able to talk a few times more like this. She just watched Misty as Misty lived in her own world under the covers.</p>
<p>“I'll levae it like this” Annalsie said.</p>
<p>“What, sorry I didn't catch that” Misty shuffled the covers and a bit of hair came out the side, her painted nails were cute against the pattern on the duvet.</p>
<p>“Nothing, I'm just saying that I'm happy right now” Annalise, in a lethargic comfy, cute way, she collapsed on Misty's covers and wrapepd herslef around Misty over the blankets, feeling the outline of her. Misty lay there not saying a word, she breathed in the smell of the fabric deeply, then let it out again.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay, good I guess, keep it up”</p>
<p>Annalise sighed, Misty's responses were so weird...</p>

<h3 id="seventeen">seventeen:</h3>
<p>Melanie sat next to the river side. She had come here with her friends, but they had found different guys and disappeared off with each other. She sat there quietly, and as she sat there she started to realize why she was sitting there. Naturally her behaviour was telling her something.</p>
<p>“I'm lonely” she said to herself, looking at everyone else walking with someone, enjoying themselves, focused on their lives. She always thought she was self satisfied and didn't need anyone else to keep her entertained, she thought she was smart enough for that. But when she looked back, the things she loved, driving, practicing her hobbies, they weren't as interesting anymore. She hadn't knitted anything in ages.</p>
<p>As soon as she looked up, she saw a couple walking past, the woman was completely tucking herself around his arm, she wanted to be as close as she could with him. He would protect her form the world and kepe her safe, take care of her. Meanwhile, she could, in her own way, direct him.</p>
<p>Melaie thought about whether it was because she worke dnigth shfits that she felt so lonely. She didn't have colleague to talk to, she wasn't attractive to attract men's attention, at least not the eligible men. And she thought she said everything to people to be truthful and honest, but now she knew that actually she wasn't saying everything, there were some things, like taking care of others, that she didn't do as much.</p>
<p>A man walked past Melanie, he didn't know who she was, or what she was thinking, he hardly noticed her, he was only looking for a bench, and noticed that one was taken. He walked along admiring the river, he was here for two days and one night, a busy tour schedule that led hm all over the country. But right now he was thinking about his hobby, which was becoming more than a hobby, something he wnted to delve deeper in. Right now hat held him back was what his wife would think of his doing so.</p>
<p>Then he thought about a woman, the ideal woman, if he met a woman who understood his art, completely touched by it, then he would marry her without a doubt. It was that simple. All fo the other things, like her morals, didn't matter as much to him he thought, he wanted a restart.</p>
<p>When he walked past Melanie he was already thinking about something else, about what he would talk about to his wife that night as they both lay beside the bedtable. He thought about how close he would be to his wife. Would they be stuck together like barnacles, or would they be cuddling at the fingers? Would she be facing away from him or towards him? Would he get some tonight.</p>
<p>As the night fell, the river deserted. Melanie's legs were tired from the hours of sitting, she looked around. Now only a few couples remained, they were all tourists. Even if she tried to talk to them they would bugger off to whatever place they came from soon enough. They were like the hares which were all over the country, just taking up space.</p>
<p>Melanie signed in for the night porter job and sat down at her chair. As soon as she sat down she felt heavy, it was the weight of all the purposelessness of her life. Even if she went on a diet it would stay. Even if she looked at a scale it wouldn't appear, it was such a private emotion. She lookedat the few customers left around who hadn't been tidied up yet. They were chatting quielty over a bottle of something that she didn't care about. Melanie stared and wondered how many of them felt the same aimlessness as her. Even if they did, she woudln't know it, it was a private emotion, and the symptoms appeared differently in each person it came across.</p>
<p>A man walked past, Melanie recognized him as the cheerful man at breakfast the other day. Daniel. But he walked past the counter without glancing at her, he went directly to the empty cafe upstairs, glancing around before entering.</p>
<p>Melanie felt sad, and she took it to mean that she had feelings for that strange man who had walked past.</p>
<p>Daniel closed the cafe door behind him and went to the far corner with a small candle. Soon the others started appearing. </p>
<p>“Did you keep it secret?” he asked each person, they nodded.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy arrived
Mr. Chatterbox arrived
Mr. Danger arrived
Mr. Purple arrived
Mr. Lazy arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry smiled and waved his hands jubilantly. He brought out a box and shared it with each of them. The candle flickered every time he moved, threatening to go out at the touch of an insult, a breathy shout, or a fart.</p>
<p>Inside the box was a black rubbish bag that had collected dust. He shook it off and brought out some masks. One was Medusa, with a thousand snakes as hair, another was a vampire with fangs sticking out. There was a goblin with huge green lumps on its head. All sorts of monsters were in the bag.</p>
<p>“Take one and wear it” Mr. Angry said. In the cold air it felt more like a command. It had been the first word spoken since everyone's arrival. </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy took the first one he saw, which was an ogre with brown teeth and blue skin. Mr. Purple took the purple one, an enigma with many eyes. Mr. Lazy rummaged through the bag, he kept looking at one and taking the next. He finally settled on one that looked almost human, except for a big slash across its face. Mr. Chatterbox frowned and finally scooped up what Mr. Danger held out for her, a horned animal with fur bits sticking out the side. Mr. Danger got something similar to hers.</p>
<p>“How about yours?” Mr. Lazy asked, “What do you have?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry showed them the mask he held handy, it was the face of a supermodel with luscious lips.</p>
<p>“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Mr. Danger said. “How come you get the best mask”</p>
<p>“It doesn't matter what mask you wear, just wear it” Mr. Melancholy said. </p>
<p>“What are the masks for anyway” Mr. Purple said, she took her mask off and threw it aside. </p>
<p>“They're a disguise” Mr. Chatterbox said. “So that no-one sees who we really are”</p>
<p>“Well Duh...? Why else would you wear a mask. I mean because in my script or whatever I'm never exposed to any people, I'm just alone and hacking systems.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you do” Mr. Lazy said</p>
<p>Mr. Purple grunted and looked away, “What do you mean is that all I do, it sounds like you think I do nothing or something”</p>
<p>“You don't have to do any dangerous work”</p>
<p>“Working on computers is dangerous okay, I'm at the same risk as you barbarians, especially if one of you messes up, who the fuck do you think they trace it to?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry interrupted everyone, as he always did. “When we are doing the heist, wear the masks. No risks, just in case you are spotted for whatever reason”</p>
<p>“But if I'm wearing the mask, won't that make me be spotted in the first place?” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“We have to work with this piece of sh**, you sure we're okay?” Mr. Danger eyed Mr. Chatterbox down. “Obviously you don't wear the mask when you're doing things that don't need spotting.” He looked her up and down, “I don't know what your'e doing here, do you have any experience with stealing things? Like illegally doing so. None of this legitimate crap.”</p>
<p>Before another argument erupted, Mr. Angry silenced them. </p>
<p>“The risks are always there” he said, “So let me tell you about it before it happens. If you're caught, you keep quiet, you don't tell the rats anything, nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“We might get caught?” Mr. Chatterbox looked around. “But how would anyone find out?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” Mr. Angry said, “But it's going to happen sometime, it's just a matter of when. There's no one hundred percent guarantee that we're going to get through it.”</p>
<p>The room grew silent. Everyone was thinking the same thing, that they were in a roller coaster and headed straight into the sea. Plunging into the deep ocean like a whale. No matter how they struggled against the seatbelts there was no breaking out.</p>
<p>“I've tried my best to keep this clandestine, the less people we have knowing about it, the betetr chances we have. And the more professional we are, the safer. But in the end this is something highly illegal, highly dangerous, and highly profitable, it's a lucrative mision.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask a question?” Mr. Lazy raised his hand politely. “Mr. Angry, if you tell us truthfully, without any complications, what are the chances of us succeeding? You've calculated everything meticulously right?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked around, as if hesitating to say the truth, “There's always a chance, like someone coming out injured, or we might have to leave someone behind because they're no longer functional, or even things like equipment failing, getting the timing wrong, these are all detrimental. And there's about a 70% chance of these things happening. The job, as a whole, if these things happen, will be about a 25% chance to succeed.”</p>
<p>“25%? You mean we're most likely going to fail?” Mr. Lazy's tone grew sharp, “You put us into this knowing this?”</p>
<p>“I'm not done” Mr. Angry said, “The likelihood of the job going without anything happening is about 30%. But even if something happens, the other people should be able to get away 68% of the time.”</p>
<p>“I don't know how you got the 68%” Mr. Purple said, “You probably have your reasons, but you're saying that 70% of the time we're going to leave someone behind and hope they don't blab about anything.”</p>
<p>“That's why right now I'm telling you this, if you find yourself caught and facing the cops, dont' say a word. Because if you do, it's not going to be good, for you”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was a true criminal, Mr. Melancholy stared at him wondering if he had done this kind fo thing before, he sounded extremely experienced and calm. </p>
<p>“How can we trust you?” Mr. Lazy said, “I don't want to be caught, I've got a wife, and a whole life ahead of me to live”</p>
<p>“That was an oxymoron right?” Mr. Danger said, “You can't have a wife and a whole life ahead of you, those two are contradictory.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy lashed back “An oxymoron is one word, not a whole sentence”</p>
<p>“Oh I'm sorry Mr. Grammar fanatic” Mr. Danger “If you're so good at english why do you have to steal in this fucking doomed to fail mission?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry slammed the table, everyone was used to it by now, he always did extreme things to control everyone. “Let's get back to the mission” he said.</p>
<p>“For what?” Mr. Lazy said, “It's doomed to fail, I don't want to die. What are we even stealing? It's not worth the money”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry grinned, surprisingly, he wasn't upset, he wasn't shy, he wasn't nervous. It was like his passion ahd bene struck. “There's only one thing I care about” he said. “More than anything else, the whole world crumbles before it, and that's this treasure, and I promised all of you about it, now we're discussing the risks and you're getting cold feet, which is natural, but think about it optimistically, if we pull this off, you'll be able to buy anything that you want for the rest of your life. The money in your bank accounts will never stop flowing, like a fountain constantly renweing itself. Your money will never run shy, your river will never run dry.” He looked around the room, “Mr. Melancholy, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“What do I want?” Mr. Melancholy looked around, “Am I allowed to say it?”</p>
<p>“I want a good wife” he said.</p>
<p>“Everything can be bought with money, something are just so expensive that they're out of reach.” he said, “In my experience, the most expensive thing in this world is love. It costs a lot of money to get lvoe where there is almost none there. But it's still affordable. Every woman you meet, you can buy, you might have to buy a car, or a house, or a job first, or an expensive bottle of cologne or expensive tasting food, but it's easily done. So you can have a wife” he said, then he turned and asked the question to Mr. Purple.</p>
<p>“I want a Dildo” Mr. Purple said, “I good Dildo that can keep me satisfied.”</p>
<p>She was joking of course, and everyone in the room laughed. But Mr. Angry had the fire burning in his eyes, the fire of passion, and once it started it didn't quench. “Of course” he said, “Material possessions are easy to buy, they're easy to replace, and you can give them away. But will they satisfy you in the long run? Will you get bored of them?” </p>
<p>“I won't get bored of a Dildo” Mr. Purple said. “Especially since it doesn't ask for anything, unlike a man”</p>
<p>“The beauty of material things is that you can buy them” Mr. Angry said, “Every made things, tangible thing in the world is in your possession”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple stopped grinning, she looked back at Mr. Angry, and her gaze talked of respect. In her mind she was considering the options, of all the stores she had window shopped at, of all the things she could use to fill the empty wardrobe, and furniture.</p>
<p>“How about you?” Mr. Angry asked Mr. Lazy. Mr. Lazy was slouched in his chair with his arms crossed. </p>
<p>“You can't buy this” he said, “I want to be respected by everyone, I want a level of honesty that pierces through all hidden intentions and motivations”</p>
<p>“You can buy it” Mr. Angry said, “If someone wants to be rich, they will respect you for having material wealth. As soon as you have something that shows your wealth, people who previosuly disrespected you, or never looked twice at you will be flocking around you, and you will feel good for a bit about it. And then after that you're going to want more.”</p>
<p>He talked about it like he had experienced, like nothing they said phased him anymore, he had heard it all before. And Mr. Lazy heard this answer and nodded, satisfied.</p>
<p>“I want originality, I want something new” Mr. Danger said. “I want a thrill, I want to bring my loved ones back from the next world, the land of no return”</p>
<p>“And you can” Mr. Angry said, “You can't bring your loved ones back of course, but with enough attention to your money and how you spend it, and how you live everyday, you can do anything you like. Money is a resource, and this world we live in is the ultimate resource, you use resources to get other resources, that's the way it works.”</p>
<p>“But in the end, my loved one, like my dear sister, how can I have her back?” Mr. Danger spoke quietly, “Or my wife's miscarriage, we had already named her, Julia. How can I bring her back? She's gone from this world, that's why there's grief of separation.”</p>
<p>“With money” Mr. Angry said, “You can't buy your loved ones, but you love them because of the emotions and feelings they give you. You can't replace them, but you can buy the experience, by buying time. Time to heal the wounds, and time to make new bruises and scars and re-experience life again. Because you've said you want quite a few things, originality, special people in your life, thrills, it sounds to me like you want a new experience, and at the same time you crave your past experiences as well.”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger collapsed in his chair. He was convinced, he could do anything after he gained this money.</p>
<p>“How about you Mr. Chatterbox?”</p>
<p>“I just want a house” Mr. Chatterbox said. “This seems like the easiest way to get it so I'm doing it.” She shrugged. “Simple right?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry nodded, “It's not the easiest or the simplest way of attaining money, but the funnest”</p>
<p>She questioned his trustworthyiness, if this whole endeavour was just a fun to him, then what happened when it stopped being fun?</p>
<p>“But all that aside” Mr. Angry said, “What is it that you actually want? Everyone wants a house, everyone wants a car, everyone wants a family, everyone complains about those things as well, wanting any of those things doesn't make you unique, so what would you like beyond all of these?” </p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox put a finger to her lips, “I like it when people talk to me about their life, I like it when everything is clear” She sat back and crossed her legs, waiting for an answer, “I guess what I've always thought about is honesty, can everyone be more honest?”</p>
<p>“So you want to buy honesty?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” she shrugged, “Do you think that's what I want”</p>
<p>“I don't know, you have you figure that out yourself” he said, “But if you want honesty, then you can't buy it directly, but you can try and make it the most viable option, by setting up your envionrment in a way that encourages it. Besides, honesty is such a wide concept. If I hire your for a job and you quit, I will be disappointed, I will feel angry, is that because there was a lack of honesty, or a lack of something else? Honesty is the answer that steps into all problems, but it isn't necessarily what should be there.”</p>
<p>The topic was confusing, and Mr. Chatterbox didn't know what he was saying, but his passion and words were enough to sway her.</p>
<p>“How about you?” Mr. Chatterbox said, “What is it that you want? Why do you work so hard to steal such an expensive thing, if you know anythign can be bought wth money, isn't that the same as saying nothing can be truly possessed at all? If you can buy everything doesn't it mean that everything is replaceable with money?”</p>
<p>“Quality is quantity” Mr. Angry said. “If you have a lot of quantity mashed into one, then it becomes quality. A black hole, the singularity, is just a lot of things mashed into one small thing, a work of art considered a masterpiece by the world is simply just a lot of information with meanings mashed into one small compact dense area”</p>
<p>“Okay, we understand your view” Mr. Chatterbox said, “But what is it you want? What is this quality you speak of?”</p>
<p>“I want something that can't be bought with money” he said.</p>
<p>This was a big contradiction that rocked the room, Mr. Angry had spent the pasty half an hour convincing everyone that everything could be bought, and once he convinced them of it, he turned his back on it and said the opposite. </p>
<p>“What is that?” The whole room asked.</p>
<p>“I don't know” Mr. Angry said, “That's why I'm personally interested and attracted to a heist, of such a grand scale and so magnificent, that it takes away all the needs of the world, and then  I can see what is truly valuable.”</p>
<p>After hearing his answer, the room was split between conflicting views of either Mr. Angry being an idiot with no direction, a fool who was playign them all, or he was so profound beyond belief. The members left the room in the end not knowing which.</p>
<p>But one thing was sure, Mr. Angry had experienced so much, too much, that he was now bored. He was like a child in a playroom who had played with all of his toys so much that he was bored of them. Now was going to throw all the toys out to see which of them he valued the most.</p>
<p>“But let's talk about the practicalities” Mr. Angry sighed, each time he had to convince all of them of this mission, he didn't even know why himself, but he had to persuade them that this cause was worth joining and fighting for. So he said things like they had a choice, people loved to have a free chocie in their decisions, then they would choose to be with him. Many times, if people could just exercise free will, then they would be happy.</p>
<p>“If you're spotted, make sure to pretend you didn't see them, but you can expect the plan to change afterwards. And after you've been seen, you have four seconds, generally you have four seconds before security kicks in. In those four seconds the other person will decide if you're suspicious or not.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry went through all sorts of training, how to walk quietly, how to come through a bad situation, how to react without shock, how to think immediate situations through. It was all part of the induction process. And at the end all of the members came through feeling tired, but productive.</p>
<p>“Now we've increased the likelihood of success by about 6%” he said.</p>
<p>No one still knew where he got the figures from, but they trusted him by now.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="eighteen-william-charlotte">eighteen: William &amp; Charlotte</h3>
<p>Time moved slowly for William. And when he wasn't in the criminal meetings, things seemed to always happen the same way. He was happy to be in the meetings just because they were signposts in his dreary life. Otherwise, he went to work, came back from work, slept, chatted with girls, and went back to work. There were no signposts showing him progress, distance to next destination. But with this, there was a date, when they would do the heist, and when things would happen.</p>
<p>Then, William found himself dreaming of the outside world. He wanted to see it, he wanted to live in it, the busy cities, and the diversity of people. Here everything was quiet and nothing ever changed, it was good, but it didn't feel alive. It felt like life was somewhere else and was slowly slipping by him.</p>
<p>“How are you doing?” A wind swept him back onto the bench. The wind was a woman he knew, it smelt like and sounded familiar. It took him a while to recognize.</p>
<p>“Hey Charlotte” He said, and she was smiling down at him, just lighting up a cigarette. With her head leaned forward and biting down on the filter like a baby on a ripe thumb. She was wearing her usual loose dark windbreaker, unzipped and with the collars almost touching the tip of her nose. It was what she wore after work. </p>
<p>She sat down and looked at him. She seemed different today, she stumbled in her actions, as if a hesitation of her self had permeated her being just for today. William realized he missed the Charlotte he knew, the one who always came and spoke to him like he was a tree or a rock, and who didn't give anyone any harm.
They both sat there quietly, sharing cigarettes and the awkwardness, and breathing at the same pace in the cool air. It was cloudy, so the stars were shrouded inside their blankets, but that was probably a good thing today.</p>
<p>“William” Charlotte finally said. It pierced through the air like a bulldozer over fresh soil. </p>
<p>He didn't answer but she was confident enough to go on. “I heard you're involved in something really bad” she said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” William gripped the side of the bench with his free hand. The other hand flicked the ashes against his leg.</p>
<p>She stared at him, his closed mouth and weary eyes suddenly looked extremely solemn to her and she wanted to stop looking. </p>
<p>“Is it true?” she said.</p>
<p>“No” William said. “Who did you hear it from.” He breathed in a out of cold air and coughed it out like a disease. </p>
<p>“I can't tell you that, you know I can't”</p>
<p>“Then why do you even ask in the first place?” he said. </p>
<p>“You will easily steal these things that are so important to others, and worth so much, does it give you pleasure?”</p>
<p>“If I was doing it, I imagine I wouldn't do it for something easy like pleasure”</p>
<p>“Then what would you do it for?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Isn't that none of your business?” William said, he looked away from her and exhaled.</p>
<p>She felt a pain in her chest well up, the suddeness of how he said it was really surprising. She thought he would at least tell her, but were they really that distant? Did he not trust her? Did he not include her in part of his life?</p>
<p>“You will steal these things so important to others” she said, “But you won't give me your virginity, you won't let me steal something like this” She sighed, he didn't answer and she had no idea what he was thinking, was he listening? Or was he bored of her and what she was saying? “I only want it” she said, “Because I'm in love with you, I realized it last time, that I'm truly falling in love with you, no one else has made me feel this way.”</p>
<p>He still didn't answer, and it was making her feel uncomfortable, she could feel his shirt against her hips, and the movement in his fingers trembled through his body. They were so close together on this bench and she had no idea what he was thinking. “It's okay” she exhaled into the night air, “You don't have to say anything, I understand.”</p>
<p>They sat there again, her thoughts were killing her, they were growing like weeds in a garden that expanded and expanded all over everything. What was he thinking? Why was he so quiet? Was it because he was ashamed of himself? Or was it because he was ashamed of her knowing? Or did he not care at all when she confessed? Did he think she was a burden and annoying? Or did he feel the same way back? Why didn't he answer?</p>
<p>“Charlotte” William said, she felt a cold touch on her shoulder, she shuddered at his touch. Was his hand always this cold? “Charlotte, why are you crying?” he said.</p>
<p>His voice was like a hot chocolate on a windy day. She realized that hot vapours of tears were running down her cheeks shamelessly. She wanted to hide them, she didn't wish to cry in front of him and betray her weakness, but it was flowing out and making her feel naked. </p>
<p>“I don't know” she shook her head, and hid her face in her arms. She didn't want him to see her crying, she was better than that, she wanted him to know she was a strong girl.</p>
<p>“You have to tell me” William said, “Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>She thought about it, it was unfair that she had to do all the thinking. “I was thinking that if I had met you earlier and fallen in love with you earlier, it would be so much easier. Before I found out about this crime. Or even if I had met you after it all happened and you were a different man. Why does it have to be this time, right now when it's so difficult for them to be together and the world is raging a war against them. After they probably can't make it work.</p>
<p>William stared at her speaking, she walked around the hotel Management like it was her backyard, she commanded subordinates and made sure everythign ran smoothly. During her breaks she went to the staff dinign area and shared jokes with her colleagues. She had many friends and was loyal and virtuous. William didn't understand how someone as amazing and accomplished as her could be with him; Charlotte with a nobody.</p>
<p>“You asked me why I'm doing it, I'm doing it because I want to change” William said. “I don't know what I want to change, or if I'm able to change for the better, but I want to change”</p>
<p>“That's okay” Charlotte said, “As long as you don't come back a woman”</p>
<p>“What?” he laughed, “Has that happened to you before? Someone you liked went away and came back as a woman?”</p>
<p>“No...” She pushed him on the shoulder playfully, “Do you think I'm such a useless woman?”</p>
<p>William didn't say the truth. Actually it was nothing profound and complicated, it was simple. But too simple for him to dare admit. He didn't have feelings for her anymore. Being with her was just for sex. He was developing feelings for other women instead.</p>
<p>“That's why I want to be with you now” Charlotte said, clearing the pause with a conclusion-like remark. “Because I know that after you do this, everything will change, maybe our feelings will die, maybe they will be overwritten by other things. But I don't want to forget the way I feel about you. I heard from someone I really respect” she said, “That men and women are very different in a way”</p>
<p>“Just in one way?”</p>
<p>“Men will store things in different folders, so they can access them easily, but women will just have one file and keep on overwriting it and save it with what is most recent and important.”</p>
<p>“Hmm” he thought about it. But why was she saying this like they were going to break up?</p>
<p>He still hadn't spoken, she had thrown all sorts of hints at him and now was confused. Why doesn't he just commit to one or the other? What was the point of leaving her hanging like this?</p>
<p>William watched as Charlotte slowly became kerfuffled, she was crazy about him. He hardly knew what was happening, only that it gave him an emotional high for him to be able to make her confused and wondering about him so much. The control he had over her was captivating. </p>
<p>And she used to enjoy his company as well, but now she just wanted to know why he wouldn't commit. It was coming to the stage where the relationship was giving her more pain than good. She wanted to move forward into something, but he wasn't going anywhere.</p>
<p>“I just want to talk to you” he said. “I really enjoy talking to you”</p>
<p>Charlotte looked at him, she didn't know it, but her eyes were riddled with patches of light. Like Betelgeuse in the night sky. “You're a really good listener” she said, “There's not many listener's in the world, but you're a really good one”</p>
<p>He smelled her</p>
<p>{
Ask Angela, she says she used to have a dream, back when she was in High School, she even went to College for it, but now it doesn't seem to matter. She still has to pay her parents back all the money, they never asked, but she knows she has to. The other day she went for an interview at the different job but wasn;t accepted, she dressed up and everything. Her degree, if she could get a job that relates to it it would be good. And she felt good, because she was moving her life forward with her own hands, walking into their was nervous, but soothing.But that's a past life, now she's here and living here. It just feels bad to be so disconnected form her past, her parents are a part of that. (She keeps talking and talking and he can't follow through She is also sad because the guy she cared about neever asked her, he only ever talked about himself, and she's happy to be able to share this with someone who actually cares for her. (But she's talking to DANIEL, and we all know that DANIEl is the least sincere guy, he compeltely uses Angela's passions, to make her do something bad for them, she is punished for it, and they are untouched. Exactly as he planned) Then she calls her Mum and apologizes, she got herself into a big mess, some guys used her and abused her, but she will be fine. and ruined her life. Her Mum says it's okay, she will support her duaghter. But Angela is crying, and her Mum doesn't know why, her mum thinks it's because she's touched by her own kindness, but it's because she regrets so much what she has done, and wishes she could go back to it all, and she knows she can never go back. She has ruined her life in this way.
Repeat her dream before and after it all happens, first time she's saying it to a nice guy who lsitens who ahs nothing to do with anything, he starst to like her as well, but she turns away from him and goes to Daniel instead. William sees this and understands, and isn't jealous, because he respects Daniel and trusts him. 
Then the second time, she is saying it to one of the girls in prison with her, that she used to have this dream, but partway through the story she breaks down into tears, because she can't handle telling the story, last time she told it she was so hopeful, now everything is crushed.
Then this woman in prison with her, who is an epitomy of bad, she has done everything bad, of the things she does everyday, if there are five hundred things, four hundred and ninety nine are bad. The one good thing is that she has never ever betrayed a friend. She finishes saying this and hugs Charlotte.
She loved sinigng theatre songs, and emt everyone and made plays and everything. But after starting her job, it slowly seemed to fizzle away in the most natural way. And she wonders whether that dreamw as real, was it really important to her. (Her friend asks her maybe it was just a temporary thing, or dreams are ethereal) And she agrees and thinks about it for a long time.)</p>
<p>Annalise sees Charlotte as a perfect girl, no wonder William likes her. Their relationship must be perfect with no complaints, and Charlotte is always holding herself together really well.
But Misty sees didfferently,. That Charlotte is more afraid, and she is doing the best thing in her circumstance, and it hits Annalise hard, the realization. That everybody else is not above her, or knows more, they are all struggling in their own way!! And no one is holding themselves together. Charlotte is only doing the best thing in her situation, because she wasn't able to do what he was. She was actually threatened, although Annalise didn't realize it. An d suddenly, although they are rivals for William's love (if he has any), they are also friends in the process. Because no one understand you better than your rival who si going through the same things as you with the same people.
They both talk about facing William's family and what they felt of it. 
But before leaving, Annalise turns around, casually, and says that after she exits through this door she will no longer be a friend, but go back to beign rivals
“Of course, I'm looking forward to it” Annalsie said. With a tear running down her lonely eye. It's always her right eye that tears up. She's still thinking about it when Charlotte comes back, she forgot something, she picks it up, ignores Annalise, acts cool, too good for her, and then walks out. 
“Oh so that's how it is, it's really already started” Annalise realizes.

<h3 id="nineteen-christmas">nineteen: Christmas</h3>
<p>In the next meeting, Mr. Angry had a new black rubbish bag tied shut at the top like one of those big stockings from Santa. His eyes were glimmering with excitement.</p>
<p>“I've got a present for all of you” He waited till everyone had sat before speaking.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Mr. Chatterbox said slowly, like she knew Mr. Angry was waiting for a response and woudln't continue until he had one.</p>
<p>He untied the top and tipped the bag to show the contents of what was inside to the group. Everyone saw it and was shocked. Mr. Melancholy was flabbergasted, but how was that possible? That was incredible, where did he get them?</p>
<p>“That's stupid” Mr. Chatterbox said. “We already have them”</p>
<p>“Shut the *uck up you idiot” Mr. Danger said. </p>
<p>But Mr. Chatterbox was right, inside the bag that Mr. Angry had brought specially for everyone today, was costumes and masks of the famous fat man who cheered everyone up.</p>
<p>“Santa Claus?” Mr. Purple said. “Is that really Santa? Is that what he looks like”</p>
<p>That's right, the costumes were Santa costumes, red, and big, and even the fake beards were included.
“You've never seen Santa?” Mr. Danger said, “What kind of childhood did you have?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple glared at him, as fi he had stepped widlly out of line, and Mr. Melancholy saw the two of them and wondered if there was something happening between them that he didn't know about. “My childhood is none of your business,okay?” After she said that, her cheeks flushed red. It took Mr. Melancholy a while to realize, but Mr. Purple was blushing. Just what kind of childhood had she had?</p>
<p>“It's a horrible idea, you're a horrible person Mr. Angry” Mr. Lazy said. And everyone became quiet, not only had he insulted Mr. ANGRY, which was illegal, but it was Mr. Lazy. He was usually the tamest little shrew in the group. No one had heard him say a negative word about anyone.</p>
<p>He went on, leaning back in his chair as if it was something well thought out and cynically planned. “When we got our monster masks, we all had to wear monster masks, but yours was a pretty woman, what the fuck is that about?”</p>
<p>When he said the F word, everyone in the room flinched to the side, like a strong wind had blown through....Mr. Chatterbox even had to cover her head to stop her hat flying away.</p>
<p>“Then, the next day you take them away, and you bring back new masks which are fucking Santa?” Mr. Lazy spat saliva onto the ground, his voice was growing hoarse and grim. And when he said fuck, the wind blew through the room again. It was crazy. The air conditioners weren't even in the bathrooms.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry fell silent, everyone wondered if he would stand his ground, or would he sway and cower. This was the decisive moment. A part of everyone still wanted to retreat from this mission, no matter how great the rewards were, they would be throwing away their life. And no reward in the world could replace your life right? All however many years of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox was shocked, she muttered under her breath, “Fuck, fuck, fuck” a few times, and then raised her hand, to see if the wind blew. But it didn't it only blew when Mr. Lazy said it.</p>
<p>“Fuck this” Mr. Lazy sat forward, and the wind blew again. Mr. Chatterbox was stunned, just how did this work? How come when she said it, there was no change, but when he said it there was this strange wind coming from somewhere.</p>
<p>“The Santa Claus costumes are better” Mr. Angry's voice was so deep that it sounded like an earthquake. Mr. Chatterbox then checked the ground, to make sure it wasn't moving. Oh my gosh, she was struggling so much just to understand what was going on...</p>
<p>“Better, better, better. You just make up these things and demand that we follow them, otherwise we'll be verbally and physically assaulted.”</p>
<p>“You don't believe me?” Mr. Angry crossed his arms, gradually, the corner of his lips pulled up, and before we realized it, he was grinning. This was what his grin looked like, it was the first time anyone had seen it. “If we use the monster masks, the mission is 5.4% more likely to fail. But the Santa costumes bring it up about that same percent.</p>
<p>“Where does the fucking 0.4% come from?” Mr. Lazy stood up and walked over to Mr. Angry, he was fuming, his hair slicked back and his fists clenched like barnacles. “You need to do some explaining you fat dick cunt slut” </p>
<p>Mr. Angry was like a piece of bamboo, not wavering to anything and standing true to his values. “Don't get me wrong” he said, “I don't have to explain anything to you, if I want you to do something you will. If I want you to sit down and shut up, you will. If I want you to drink a cup of coffee, you will. If I want you to eat spaghetti by rolling each strand three times and putting exactly two teaspoons of Parmesan, you will. And if I want you to kill someone, you will. If I want you to kiss someone, you will.” He scratched his right ear, “So let's see, if I want you to turn around three times and jump up and down, then fart, will you do it?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy didn't respond for a while. His eyes grew lazy, and for a few minutes the two men stood facing each other like two bulls rallying for territory and competing to see which of them was madder.</p>
<p>“I'm not doing a darn thing you say, I don't have to, and you need to realize that”</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened, just after Mr. Lazy said this, his eyes widened, as if realizing something. And he started to move his feet on the spot, first the right foot, and then his elft foot, spinning them around and around. He was turning. Then he started jumping as well. He was doing it so fast that he was puffing, his cheeks were red like a puffer fish, and he looked at us normally, as if he were doing some everyday exercise.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy looked to Mr. Angry, he was smiling, and not just a smile, btu a huge big grin that wrapped his lips. They were like the bumper bar of a car that blocked him from the world. Mr. Melancholy had never seen a smile like that, the expression was uncanny.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy stopped jumping, and slowly, he leaned forward, sticking his butt out to everyone. He still was emotionless, as if he were doing a mundane task like eating, or drinking, or pissing, or having sex. He closed his eyes shut, wrinkles appearing on his brows and forehead, his mouth was strained and he started to focus.</p>
<p>Slowly, a fart broke into the air, first a small one, then a medium sized one, followed by a loud fart. And it was the loudest most disgusting fart any of them had ever heard.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple closed her eyes, and held her nose shut for fear of contamination. Mr. Chatterbox was horrified by the whole ordeal and immediately booked an appointment with her psychiatrist for recovery from trauma. Mr. Danger took a step back, he sensed the danger and didn't want to be a part of it. He was scared and wanted to run away like a little boy. But Mr. Melancholy, he was focused still on Mr. Angry, who seemed to be enjoying every moment of this. And it was a different sort of fear that overtook Mr. Melancholy. He closed his eyes and saw himself on a highway, it was the scenery near the hotel, the long single road leading in and out of the hotel Management</p>
<p>He was driving a car, and it was a dream, so the sides of the car were battered like they had been in a frying pan, and his peripheral vision was hazy. As he drove along, he realized he was late, his watch kept ticking out loud telling him to speed ahead, so he went fast, and faster, and faster, his foot was pressing the bottom of the gas, but the car wouldn't go any faster, so he pressed harder on the gas, until his foot was hitting the ground, and the pedal was broken and crumbling away like a crevasse.</p>
<p>The world was speeding past, the world consisted of trees nearby and grass the fleeted, the road kept stretching forward, winding here and there, but never ending. He wanted to go faster still, but couldn't. The car was choking.</p>
<p>But when he looked beside him, a car overtook him, it was so fast, a newer model yellow car. It kept approaching and finally went past him. Mr. Melancholy turned his head to see who was driving, but the windows were blackened out, as it passed him, he felt a strong presence. But soon the car went past, without indicating, without any signs, going much much faster than he was, and disappeared into the distance.</p>
<p>They all put on the costumes, They each had their own sizes, and when they all fit the bears and hat on, they all looked the same apart from being different heights. Then they took a photo, and they were all smiling or frowning, but it didn't come throuhg since their mouths were blocked off by the foul smelling beard, made of half polystyrene, half BPA's.</p>
<p>“Are we robbing the hotel on Christmas?” Mr. Danger said, “Is that how it is? While everyone is excited and looking forward to the presents they're going to get, we're going to be sneaking around and rob all of it from them?”</p>
<p>They were all standign in front of the camera, Mr. Melancholy felt Mr. danger's hair armpit next to him through his suit, and Mr. Lazy was tall behind them. Mr. Purple and Mr. Chatterbox were in front, looking big and beautiful. Mr. Angry stood to the side, like the teacher in the school photo.</p>
<p>Then when the picture was taken, and they all looked in the digital camera at it, Mr. Melancholy felt a dab of melancholy hit him like an injection of helplessness. He wished he had vaccinated himself against this emotion.</p>
<p>All six of them were standing in front of the camera, no expression, arms tucked around each other like pals. But he realzied what they were, they always laughed and enjoyed each other's company, but they weren't any cool people who everyone looked up to and wanted to be a part of. They were just another group of people, and in fact, they would soon be criminals, and would be looked down on by everyone. If they thought they were cool for even one moment, then they were wrong.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy left it with that thought.</p>
<p>When Mr. Melancholy opened his eyes he was in his room, the bed covers were over him, the light was off, and his alarm was ringing, demanding his presence at work. He was William now. </p>
<p>As he walked to work he thought about Mr. Angry, his dream affected him powerfully, and he didn't know if he could trust him anymore. Mr. Angry changed his mijnd about the masks so easily, if it was such a fickle decision, could they trust him with more important things, like their life?</p>
<p>Maybe Mr. Angry was living a dream, he was so desperate that it had made him delirious to reality.</p>
<p>“You're off to work?” A familiar voice was behind him, William turned and saw Gerry. A.K.A, Mr. Danger. He was smiling.</p>
<p>“What happened last night, that was so weird right?” William said.</p>
<p>Gerry immediately looked around to check if anyoen could hear them, no one was around, there were a few tourists, but they were too busy taking pictures and talking to their family. “Don't speak about it here”</p>
<p>“What did you think of it though?”</p>
<p>“About Mr. Angry?” Gerry sighed, he put his hands on his hips, stood there for a bit, then grabbed William and took him away to a private room. They walked through the hotel until they got to the meeting area, it was made up of many chairs organized for a meeting in the future, or a meeting that had finished in the past. Only for special occasions.</p>
<p>“I talked to Mr. Purple” he said, “I don't know her real name, so I just call her that” He sat down on one fo the chairs and crossed his legs like a female. He was wearing long and elegant pants, and was cleanly shaven. Always neatly dressed, he looked directly at William when he spoke. “She used to be a psychologist, she said”</p>
<p>“Really?” William was intrigued, “I thought she was a painter or something?”</p>
<p>“Painter? Where did you get that? Tell me”</p>
<p>“Oh, no I thought that was the case.” </p>
<p>“Well apparently she's done a handful of jobs” Gerry said, “Psychologist, gardener, international ambassador, statistical analyst for a major firm, and even a pornstar.”</p>
<p>“What?” William tried to picture it, how could anyone be all those things?</p>
<p>“Anyway, it doesn't matter, we're talking about our boss, not her” Gerry said. And William cringed at the word boss, he just realzied it, that was their relationship wasn't it? Mr. Angry was their boss, not some innocent dude doing innocent things on equal relations with them, but he was actually their boss. That was how Gerry saw it. “She said that as a psychologist, she wouldn't trust him, he's mentally unstable and close to insane. She's been trying to figure out what sickness he has.”</p>
<p>“Then why is she still following him?” WIlliam said. He was excited to talk to Geryr about this, to talk to anyone about this heist, it was a big relief to be able to share experiences with someone, anyone at all.</p>
<p>“Who is Mr. Purple?” William said, “Where does she come from, and what does she do here? Does she have a history with crime?”</p>
<p>“I'm lucky” Gerry smiled</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I'm attracted to men”</p>
<p>“So you're unlucky right?'</p>
<p>“No” he shook his head, “Women are crazy, as a gay man I can tell you that straight up” his voice became gayer and gayer as he spoke, “ Women are fine, but Mr. Purple isn't, she' s a mystery, a complete enigma, I've talked to the others about her, and no-one knows anything about her, not even her work here, or where she lives, let alone her relationship history. I mean, how did Mr. Angry meet her, and convince her to do this bullshit operation? For all we know, she could even be his wife, his personal cunt. When we're talking about her, it's like, she did that as well? Eevryone knows something different about her, but when you try to put it all together, it doesn't make sense, who exactly is she?”</p>
<p>“You sound like you're attracted to her” William said, “You've thought about her a lot”</p>
<p>“Attracted to her, yes” Gerry smiled, “But good gracious I'm not in love with her, and I'm attracted to men” he said it like he was proud of it, “Because if I was attracted to women like all the rest of you dirty disgusting and very bad men, I don't know if I'd be able to hold back from her. Other women, fine. But Mr. Purple? Oh my gosh, she's amazing.” He turned to William, “So, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“It's true” William said, “For some time now, I've been wondering about her, we spend so much time with her in the meetings, yet we have no idea where she comes from, or who she is, or what her hobbies are, and how she got into crime.”</p>
<p>“You like her huh? No mistake”</p>
<p>William sighed, he felt helpless against these powerful surges of electricity, “I don't really like her, But I definitely want to fuck her so badly. Just once is enough, but I want to see what's beneath the surface, what all the secrets are about.” When he said the f word, a wind blew again. He didn't know from where, but Gerry felt it as well. He looked around to see it.</p>
<p>“She's doing a good job of keeping herself secret” Gerry said, “Like the women who wear these big veils, it makes you want to know what's underneath, becuas ethey act like other women, but you can only see their eyes, nothing else. And it make sme want to rip everything off and expose them and laugh, and then fuck them senseless. That's what it's about to be a man”</p>
<p>“But don't touch her, she's danger” he warned</p>
<p>“What do you mean she's danger? There's a lot of women who are like that, a lot of men as well. It's like I don't know them at all, although I'm always around them, and I can only see their eyes, but otherwise everything else has been designed for you to see.”</p>
<p>“I think of it like this” Gerry said, “It's just my humble opinion, but I find it like the childhood game we played at fucking birthday parties and stuff. Wrap the wrap, or whatever it's called. Pass the Parcel, that's right, and there's a huge ball of parcel and you pass it around and each person unwraps a little bit of it, and you pass it on to the next person, and they unwrap a little more, and it gets smaller and smaller and everyone starts to see the shape of the parcel and try to guess what's inside. But only the last eprson at the end who unwraps the last ;ayer gets it. And everyone's sitting there like fucking ducklings, hoping they will get the last part of it and get the fucking thing inside all this wrapping. Only one person gets it, because they were sitting in the right fucking spot, and the guys next to them weren't that's it, there's no fucking skill or communication or fate, it's just all up to fuck... your fucking luck. ” He was describing it with his hands moving, and looking around, “And when you're the parent who has to clean up after it, I had to once, for my little brother's birthday, and there's this whole pile of wrapping paper that's so beautiful that no one wanted, everyone only wanted the gift, they rip the wrapping paper off, although it's what makes the whole thing beautiful in the first place, you know what I mean?”</p>
<p>William knew exactly what Gerry meant, but he was feeling a bout of insecurity and awe. Staring at Gerry made him feel like he was staring at a glorious mountian or something, and he wondered how Gerry was so smart, and he wished to be able to be like him as well, how did he think of such an amazing analogy?</p>
<p>“It's just my humble opinion, what do you think?” Gerry said.</p>
<p>And William forgot all the people he knew and who he was loyal to, and just thought of Mr. Purple, and how he wanted to conquer her. The thought started to occupy him like a bad taste in the mouth.</p>
<p>“I'm not loyal” he said. “Least of all to myself”</p>
<p>William walked back, and went into the bathroom before work. Then he heard next door a female voice repeating, “Fuck, fuck, fuuuck, fuck, ffffuck” It echoed through the walls like a jackhammer.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” he said. He pushed open the door to the bathroom, because he was weird, and because he was perverted. He saw Annalise standing in front of the mirror with her eyes closed. She immediately opened her eyes to see William. </p>
<p>“It's really hot today” she waved her hand at her face like a fan,she had one hand on the sink, and was leaning over it and looking into the mirror, her cheeks were flushed red like a heart. “I'm just cooling myself off, and for some reason saying this makes a wind blow and make me feel cooler. Oh sorry, this must have looked really weird to you.” She looked at William, “Sorry for swearing in front of you, I know you don't like it. But this actually really helps, you should try it.” She gifted.</p>
<p>“No, that;'s fine :)” William said, “I was just checking to see everything was okay”</p>
<p>“Ohh, you're so sweet” Annalise grinned.</p>
<p>They got talking and decided to meet after work for a brief debrief. And they both knew what that meant.</p>

<p>Angela was on the phone to her parents. They had an online video chat session once a week. She was especially elevated this week and told them the great news, her life purpose felt like ti was becoming established.</p>
<p>“I'm so excited Mum” She looked at her parents on the screen, they looked back at her, both peering into the screen like it was a window to her soul. </p>
<p>“That's really good darling” her father said, like he had no idea what she was talking about. And he didn't he stared through the screen attempting to understand his daughter, hoping that she woudln't stray too far, but also happy for her that she was living her life. He was proud of her, for being so strong and outgoing so far away from them. She really was becoming a strong and amazing woman. Besides, she was still keeping her studies u, and had big ambitions in the future.</p>
<p>“I'm so excited Dad” she said “I've met someone really special, he might even be the one, someone amazing and smart and quiet and considerate and listens to her carefully without judging what she has to say.”</p>
<p>“Slow down darling” her mother said, “How long have you known this man?”</p>
<p>“About two weeks” she said, “But I feel like I've known him all my life, there's that much connection between us, we're really close, everyone sees it as well.”</p>
<p>“Don't let him touch you though” Her father said, “You don't know how men are, especially a kind and innocent girl like you, men are dangerous, so be very careful, Angela, you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Yes Dad” She looked away outside, to make sure her window was closed, she didn't want someone else hearing this conversation. When someone walked past outside she waved back to them with a smile. But Daniel wasn't like that...</p>
<p>“I think that place has done wonders for you” Her mother said. “You were always so lonely at school, it seems like you've made a lot of friends there”</p>
<p>“I'm so lucky, I feel like I don't deserve this, to be this happy” she couldn't hold back a giggle in the camera. </p>
<p>“Just don't stress over him okay? Just treat it like a friendship for now, move slowly dear Angela” Her mother said. She looked at her husband from the corner of her eyes, as if she wanted to say more, but didn't. She turned back and saw her happy daughter, so far away, but so happy, and smiled. This was happiness. </p>
<p>“Mum, I'm not stressing, why are you talking about stressing?”</p>
<p>“No, I know darling, I know you're not, and you're very capable, it's just that I hope you don't that's all”</p>
<p>“Why are you talking about stressing then, if it's nothing”</p>
<p>“Because there's so many men out there, and half of them are nice, you're still young, don't rush into this, you will meet a lot of people and there might be others who are more suitbale for you.”</p>
<p>Angela pictured what her Mom was saying, she put hundreds of men in front of her, tall men, short men, chubby men, men with six packs, blonde men, brown men, black men, white men, albino men, scarred men, handicapped men, gentle men, romantic men. She pictured them all, and each time Daniel's face somehow popped itslef onto their faces, like it was an (insert Daniel's face here) tag.</p>
<p>“It doesn't have to just be this one person.” Her Mother said.</p>
<p>But Angela coudlnt' imagine anyone else, Danielw as really unique, and had a kind of animalistic wild power about him that was really attractive. Other men were too shy, or too rude, or blatantly lazy and she imagiend them farting everywhere like dogs. She shook her head...there was no point, she saw something special in him that they just woudln't see. She didn't tell them what she thought, she nodded and smiled kindly.</p>
<p>“Darling” Her mother leaned in to the screen so that her face was taking up three quarters of it, her poor father was squished to the side and struggling to stay in the border, like a sea urchin.</p>
<p>“If I didn't go to Wanaka, I never would have met your father, but I would have met someone else” her mother said, “But because I was ready to get married, I married your father” She was talking quickly, as if this was the only moment she could ever say this. She looked at her husband struggling to stay in the screen beside her with unease. Then she raised her hand and pushed him out. “Go away for a second” she second, “Come back later, I've got something private to say”</p>
<p>The husband opened his mouth to protest, but he saw the deadly look in his wife's eyes, he looked in the screen and saw his daughter, waiting expectantly for her mother to continue. And he drooped his head and sobbed away like a poor puppy.</p>
<p>“Is that always how you treat him when I'm not around?” Angela said. She was amazed at how little he would budge.</p>
<p>“It's alright, we'll go for ice cream or something later” her mother siad.</p>
<p>“But, what I wanted to say was that I met many men, some of them were your father's friends who confessed to me, others were rich with no morals. But they could have promised me a wonderful life with everything I wanted.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you marry Dad? You make more money than he does, and he hardly even talks to you, he's always making his lego sculptures like a kid.”</p>
<p>“Because I was attracted to his creative thinking” she said, “His thinking was different to everyone else's around there, and I found that really enticing, when we talked, we would talk until deep into the night until he had to go home. And then I found myself excited to see him and talk to him more the next day, before I knew it, we were putting rings on each other's fingers. But that's not it!” </p>
<p>“There's no perfect one Angela. There's timing, at a certain point in your life you want a certain type of person, and later you want a different type of person, some of the other men were perfect, but I was too young, or I wanted to do something els,e I wasn't ready. Your father came along at the right time that's all, and I was also at the right time for him. You're young so you have all these ideals, which is great, it makes you work towards something, but you also need to see how the world works.”</p>
<p>This was shattering news to the young romantic Angel, who was expecting fate to tie her together with Daniel. There was no one like him in the world, he was unique, but so was everyone.</p>
<p>Around the hotel Management, everyone was leaving and coming and going. Angela had bene ehre for almost a year, but the people she had come with had all left, the German woman she went through orientation with had moved on to a different job, she made a boyfriend here on the first week. Another man, had a girlfriend when he came here, but after two weeks he said they had broken up. Her friend Thomas left, and Mirana was leaving soon as well. The two new porters who had only been here a month had also announched that they were leaving. Some of her colleagues that she had deep discussions with, about study, about life, about work, they had left, or their life circumstances had changed. Everyone was coming and going like the wind. Angela was the only one here, studying and thinking of moving forward in life. For some reason this conevrsation with her mother made her think of this.</p>
<p>“Are you still there?” her mother said, “Are you listening? How come you always stop listening, do you have a problem with focus? Are you on drugs?”</p>
<p>“No Mum, I'm NOT on drugs, okay?” Angela got mad like a rose and slammed her computer lid shut. “Bye Mum” she looked at all her books lying in front of her, stacked high on the wooden desk. Then she suddenly felt like crying. “Who am I kidding, I'm not worth anything” and she felt strange why Daniel would pay her so much attention, to everyone else she was just a loser and they didnt' even bother talking to her.</p>
<p>That night Angela went to the bar to study again. It was past midnight and the clock struck, the last of the guests in the hotel heard it and stood up to prepare for their early activities tomorrow. They briefly looked to the side fo the room where Angela was furiously studying concepts and writing notes down. </p>
<p>“There's a yellow aura from her” The man with the cardigan said to his partner, a man with thick round glasses and clean brown hair combed back like a kitten's paws.  </p>
<p>“Definitely” the man said.</p>
<p>Angela was scribbling notes for however long, and when she looked up, as if she were dreaming, Daniel was standing in front of her. He didn't wear his usual smirk and cocky look, or be full of understanding, this time he was biting his bottom lip, he was wearing a black shirt with the collar folded naturally, and his sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He was looking straight at her.</p>
<p>He sat down next to her without asking, ang Angela unconsiously moved over. She realized that she had come to this bar after talking with her Mom in hopes of meeting this man again. Now that he was here she was excited and nervous. She hoped he would enjoy her company and trust her, and she wished she could entertain him as well.</p>
<p>“I was making beds, as I do for eveyr fucking hour of every day” he said, looking straight forward at the huge pillar that connected the ground where they were at to the roof high above them. “My supervisor came up to me with gentle and helpful advice. She told me that I'm always dreamy and not attentive. She said I should be more attentive and make the beds faster.” Angela wondered why Daniel was talking about this to her, she tried to understand it, she tried to understand him. And recently, instead of studying her books to further herself, she found herself studying Daniel. What he was thinking, what he might be thinking about, what he was doing right now. Recently, she was thinking about him a lot and it was starting to make her tired. She wondered if he was thinking about her also. But when she sat her listening to him speaking, the more she thought about him,the more sad she started to feel; like somehow she couldn't connect with him at all. He just came up to her and started talking about things that were occupying his mind, she felt like he didn't mind her much.</p>
<p>She clsoed her book slowly, and her notes as well, the scribbles turning vertically, and then gone, trapped between the pages. She bound her notebook and crossed her legs, facing Daniel, trying to understand him. But instead of listening, she floated to how he didn't really care about her and wasn't accepting her into his life. She didn't know anything important about him. He only talked about work, but not about what he liked and disliked, how he felt it. She didn't know any of his secrets, even though she had told him so many already. </p>
<p>“What's troubling you” Daniel said, he looked over, and his expression was so kind. His hands were crossed in his lap, and she wished he would hold her hand, and they could just sit and look at the fire in the bar together.</p>
<p>“I feel like...”</p>
<p>“You feel like what?” Daniel said.</p>
<p>But she couldn't say it to him, because she was afraid that if she said it he might start to ignore her, or won't mind it. Then her fears would be realized and it would be true. And that was so scary to know that he didn't care for her. No one had ever been so kind to her.</p>
<p>“I feel like I'm going crazy, I'm always thinking about what you say, I can't concentrate on my own life anymore”</p>
<p>Was she worth being loved at all? What was she to Daniel? Just a place for him to tell her his emotions so she could take his anger and feelings, and then he could go somewhere else? </p>
<p>“You're falling for me” he said, so plainly and bluntly, that it could have swelled into rudeness. But the way he said  wasn't condescending, it was really sweet and truthful.</p>
<p>“Maybe” she said, “I was here, hoping you would come”</p>
<p>“And I turned up” he said, “Hoping to see you here” </p>
<p>She looked up at him, her eyes moved from the cloth on her belly, to Daniel's eyes looking straight at her with so much sincerity and honesty that she wanted to melt into him.</p>
<p>“Does Daniel like the way I chose to dress today?” she managed to say.</p>
<p>He was still gazing over her like she was a cloud he was trying to figure out. Then, slowly, his eyes moved down her figure, at all of the cotton and polystyrene over her, dyed to different colours like a rainbow.</p>
<p>“You look gorgeous” he said.</p>
<p>“Daniel, you're very popular, and I'm not popular like you, so I don't know this very well, but if you like me, and I'm worth it, then why don't you sleep with me? I've opened my legs so to speak, quite a few times. Are you not attarcted to me?”</p>
<p>Daniel looked down, and her legs were open, and her dress was horizontal over her thighs. He looked back up at her. He gently moved his hand on her knee and she closed her legs. Next, he laughed, at first quietly, but then it grew to a sound that rivalled the piano. And she was surprised, she had no idea why he was laughing, what was so funny? Wasn't this what guys wanted?</p>
<p>“You don't need to do that” he said.</p>
<p>Her heart tightened for a second, and she fell for him even more.</p>
<p>He looked back at the pillar again, “It's amazing, I've met so many people, some women are powerful and live in big suburban homes with huge dogs, others are impoverished and in slums so dirty that they only decorate their doorway with their prized possessions. But they are all the same in the end.”</p>
<p>She was confused, why did he say that?</p>
<p>“Don't worry” he said. She looked like worry to him. “I'll see you next time”</p>
<p>Before she knew it, the space next to her on the couch was empty, and her books were closed. She moved her hand next to her on the couch, the leather was warm, it felt like a family.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-one-dont-talk-to-mr-danger-about-this">twenty one: “Don't talk to Mr. Danger about this”</h3>
<p>The crew were supposed to meet at an appointed time, and for the first, time, Jason turned up to the meeting early. He walked in and only Mr. Angry was there, he was sitting in the corner with a smile. 
“Mr. Lazy” he said, “Nice to see you here how does it feel to be early?”</p>
<p>“It feels the same as it does to be late, fricken shit”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you a story, Mr. Lazy” Mr. Angry stood up and moved his chair beside Mr. Lazy's. Mr. Lazy ahd deliberately taken the stool furthest away, he looked up at the clock and saw that they had fifteen minutes before everyone else would start to come in.</p>
<p>“My sister” he said, “Was cheating on her boyfriend, every second Tuesday from 5 to 7. She's a lot older than him, so it doesn't even matter anyway. She never told her boyfriend, just after seven pm every Tuesday, she went back to him, walked in the door, as if she were in MacDonalds and ordered fried and a burger consistently. Then one time she went to Burger King, then she decided she didn't like Burger King, so went back to Macca's. There's no harm in that right?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy nodded like an idiot, he had no idea why Mr. Angry was telling him this. Was there some profound message in this? Was Mr. Angry lonely and looking for friendship? Why the fuck was he telling him this?</p>
<p>A voice from the corner piped up, “Are you seriously comparing cheating to food right now? Do you seriosuly think that's a valid comparison to be making? That makes me worried to hear you say that, so just stop please. Before you lose any more integrity in my eyes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy looked into the corner and saw Mr. Purple sitting there. She had her legs crossed with black stockings running up and hiding underneath a purple dress. Her feet were covered by spiky white heels so high that they could kill a man of lustiness and blue balls.</p>
<p>“How long were you there for?” Mr. Lazy asked her. He hadn't noticed her at all. </p>
<p>“Besides, Mr. Lazy's married, boss, you shouldn't be talking about cheating to a married man” she said it coyly. She had completely ignored Mr. Lazy's inquiry. She was focused on Mr. Angry, and it made him wonder what kind of relationship they had.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry sighed, “I'm becoming frustrated because I'm unable to talk freely anymore with a sdistic woman in the room”</p>
<p>“You can say whatever you want, just because I have a vagina isn't going to hold someone like you back anyway” She was snarling, Mr. Lazy hadn't seen mr. purple so aggressive, was this always in her character? She was so mysterious, he knew nothing about her that he was intrigued, also because she didn't pay him any attention, like he was furniture that she used. How did she know that he was married?</p>
<p>“You're a married man” she turned to Mr. Lazy, so how come you're always around young girls and joking about sex, what does your wife think about that?”</p>
<p>This bitch, Mr. lazy thought, she's had to bring up the worst of things. “Is that any of your business?” he said.</p>
<p>She frowned, “Maybe, maybe not” She wasn't in the slightest offended.</p>
<p>Thens he turned back to their boss, who was still sitting beside Mr. Lazy. She was in the mood to stir up some tension. To turn the element on and heat everyone up.
“Mr. Lazy, have you heard about Mr. Danger?” she said. Her eyebrows were raised, like she was really curious, but it was all an act to tempt Mr. Angry.</p>
<p>“No, what about him?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, Mr. Danger committed a serious crime a few years ago.” She waited for a response</p>
<p>“What crime” </p>
<p>She smiled, she was getting everything she wanted, this manipulative bitch had him in her grasp. “Apparently” she said the word like she had no idea about it and was equally surprised. “Apparently Mr. Danger raped and murdered three young girls straight after a successful bank robbery, it hit the papers globally. But that wasn't all, a few men were also found dead, they were accomplices of the bank robbery crime.”</p>
<p>“So you're saying Mr. Danger is a paedophile as well as being a highly dangerous and volatile criminal?”</p>
<p>“Isn't it horrible?” she said, “He killed the people he worked with, they trusted each other and went through the bank robbery, and he shot them in the head, bang bang bang, three times each.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy was shocked. How come someone like this was working with them...</p>
<p>“Mr. Lazy” she uncrossed her legs and crossed them the other way, her heels twirled around in circles on the tip of her toes. “Would you hire someone like Mr. Danger if you knew about this?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy shook his head, “No way, to harm other people is one thing, to harm your own? That's a whole different story all together, I would never trust someone like that.” He looked to Mr. Angry beside him, who was expressionless, as if he were watching TV ads for the past five minutes. “I'm sure the boss didn't know about this, but we know it now and surely can get him removed from the operation?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple smiled, as if she had Mr. Lazy stringing along, “It's funny, because Mr. Angry knew all about Mr. Danger's actions in the past, which question his loyalty and trustworthiness, not to mention his basic moral code of ethics. And he still hired him for the job, he didn't tell any of us that we would be working with a psychopathic monster. Mr. Danger has done the lowest and most base things a human can do, the worst crimes available to humanity have been committed by that man, and yet he still kills his loyal team members in the process, he's more barbaric than an animal, can you believe this?” She pulled up her hands, “Isn't this crazy? What's to say he won't blow our heads off after the job?” </p>
<p>Her legs were still uncrossed, Mr. Angry was still expressionless, Mr. Lazy felt confused, what was happening here? Mr. Purple seemed too calm to be upset about this, and Mr. Angry didn't look like he cared what was happening. He didn't even look like he knew what was happening around him.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy looked to Mr. Angry for an answer, surely their boss wouldn't hire this man if he knew this right?</p>
<p>“If you grow up in many cultures” Mr. Angry said, “You come to understand things, you learn empathy, and to relate to people. And you learn a valuable lesson, that what you don't like, is because you dont know enough about it.” Mr. Lazy wondered where exactly his boss had grown up. Had he been all around?</p>
<p>“I knew about Mr. Danger's history” Mr. Angry said, “But since Mr. Purple decided to raise it here, let me explain. She seems to think this is funny, but you don't, so I'll tell you”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple was smiling, she was amused, and it shocked Mr. Lazy. Really, what was the relationship between these two? Was she some kind of sadist?</p>
<p>“He's a homosexual too, he can't sink any lower” she laughed.</p>
<p>“Don't talk to Mr. Danger about this, because he might get angry. He won't be embarrassed, but he will be angry, he's just that kind of person.” Mr. Angry said, he tilted his stool towards Mr. Lazy. Mr. Lazy had his arms crossed, he didn't know what to expect, to be working with a crazy man was extremely worrying, but even more was Mr. Angry who was trying to justify it to him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Danger grew up in a normal family with good well to do parents who raised him with a strong moral background and with love. He moved from here to have normal colleagues with a normal day job. But one day, out of nowhere he started telling the people around him that he was busy. He started using all of his time at work. He came back from work exhausted, his family members said that they felt like they didn't know him anymore and that something about him had changed. He was a good young prospect, moving up in the world, but he was also becoming regularly tired and angry.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked up at the clock while speaking, checking how long he had left, he looked around a lot, as if the story were second nature, and he dind't have to focus to tell it properly. Mr. Lazy wasn't sure if his boss was trying to use the story to justify these actions, or if he simply wanted him to know the truth. He didn't know where trust lay in their heist group. He didn't know who he could trust, and how much it was safe to trust anyone. Was it really okay to trust Mr. Angry? How about Mr Purple, who was still smirking in the corner?</p>
<p>“About this time, Mr. Danger called his family to say he didn't have time to do things, but wanted to be with them. It was a strange and unnerving message for his family. Then on the weekends he went to counselling sessions at a local pastor. Here he met all the people and he talked to everyone and made good friends, he talked to everyone. Everyone said he was really lovely and he was well-liked and popular among them.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy wondered how Mr. Angry knew this story, had he asked him first hand? It didn't sound like it, it sounded more like he had also done the research himself from the corner and then made a decision.</p>
<p>“Mr. Danger started bringing bouquets to the Church every weekend, people siad he was so sweet, he would bring huge bouqeuts of almost a hundred different flowers all mixed in, it was so big and had such a strong fragrance that the whole room smelled divine. But one week...”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry stopped, “Are you sure you want to hear this? “ he said. </p>
<p>“Tell him the rest, don't stop!” Mr, Purple shouted from the side, “He deserves to hear it.”</p>
<p>“I thought you said Mr. Danger did a bank robbery” Mr. Lazy said, “Does this lead into it?”</p>
<p>“No” Mr. Angry shook his head, “It's a completely different story of Mr. Danger, I don't know the one about the bank robbery so well, only this one”</p>
<p>Just how many stories did Mr. Danger have? This just reduced his credibility even lower than what meager amount it had been sitting on. So why was Mr. Angry even tellling this story then? It had to end well, that must be the reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry continued, “Then a young Mr. Danger went to church one more time, same as usual, he brought a big bouquet, but this time, halfway through the sermon, he put the bouquet in his lap and brought out a big gun from the bouquet of flowers. He moved the flowers to the side and the shiny metal weapon came out still with the pollen and petals of the flowers on it. He had been taking the gun in the bouquet for a while, but only this time he decided to use it. Mayeb he was slowly contemplating and developing the courage to do so. But finally on this one weekend he went in and shot everyone in the building. It wasn't for money, it wasn't for belief, it wasn't for revenge, it wasn't for anything grand like that, he told me it was just because he was bored.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was telling this story with a different tone now, it wasn't a reprimanding tone telling him not to repeat these actions, and it wasn't to justify anything that had been committed, it was a tone of respect. Mr. Angry was speaking with a calmness and an admiration of Mr. Danger. And this horrified Mr. Lazy. How could he associate this story of a murderer with commendment? Just who was he working for?</p>
<p>“They never caught the culprit in the paper, Mr. Danger ran back home and washed himself off. He cleaned every inch of his body and threw away all of his weapons. Then he knelt down on the floor and prayed for forgiveness. He said that a lady at the community upset him, and if she hadn't said that thing to him, he wouldn't have done it.”</p>
<p>“Said what?” Mr. Lazy said, </p>
<p>“Said Mr. danger should have cleansed himself, but she had no idea that mr. danger washed himself everyday and it was actually the smell of his cologne she didn't like”</p>
<p>“So he did all of that because of a normal comment from someone innocent?”</p>
<p>“He just got angry” Mr. Angry shrugged, “It happens to everyone now and then”</p>
<p>“No it doesn't” Mr. Purple said, she looked at Mr. Lazy, “Don't you think his story is atrocious? What if one of the things we said to Mr. Danger has upset him, he doesn't show any dislike or offence, no, he waits a month or two, and then shoots you and all of your friends and family dead.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry went on, “Then with that stress gone, Mr. Danger furthered his career and started making money, and solidified meaningful relationships. Just once was enough, he had to try it, so then he went and became homosexual”</p>
<p>“So the bank robbery story was true as well?”</p>
<p>“I assume so” Mr. Angry said, “But it doesn't matter, I see something amazing in Mr. Danger, one day he's going to be an amazing man who does a lot fo good for this world, that's why I hired him for this job.” </p>
<p>“But he might kill us, he has that history, you just said so yourself”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry shrugged “Every once in a while a guy's gotta snap, it's just that some guys snap bigger than others that's all.”</p>
<p>“But how about the people who died? The loved ones so many people lost? The crimes he's committed but hasn't paid for?”</p>
<p>“It's not up to me to judge”</p>
<p>“Yes it is! People died, are you listening?” Then it hit Mr. Lazy, why Mr. Angry admired Mr. Lazy so much. “So is this your snap? This whole heist you're organizing? You want Mr. Danger to be a part of it as well because of his history.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked at the clock and stood up, “No, it's the money, huge fortunes, can you even imagien it? It's almost time to start.”</p>
<p>“Do you get pleasure bossing us around? Anyone can see that you're motivated by money, sure, but it's not the only reason you're doing this, no lover of money could put this much attention to detail and malicious intent into it. There's a lot easier ways of making money. What we're doing here isn't a normal heist, if it were, it would be okay. But what i'm getting involved in, it's full of malicious intent to harm others. And I'm growing more and more uncomfortable with it, I want to get it done and over with, I regret ever joining this, I regret ever talking to you, I wish scum like you had never entered my life.”</p>
<p>“Well you can elave now” Mr. Angry said, still looking at the clock ticking away continuously. If they talked about profound things, like the meaning of life, or even if they talked about trivial things like the temperature of the tea, or the weather, they ticked away all the same. Life was just a series of tickings, and once it ticked enough it was over. </p>
<p>“You know I can'tleave, you've got disciplinary methods of action prepared. I know you have, and you're going to mow me down if I desert”</p>
<p>Daniel didn't do or say anything to deny this, “Well, you could just stick through with it...” He was hardly involved in the conversation.</p>
<p>He was good at organizing things, people included. He didn't care if Mr. Lazy stayed or left, the end result was the same. And that in itself made Mr. Lazy resolve to stay. Because even if he felt powerless, it was better to stay and just feel powerless than to leave and be powerless and poor.</p>
<p>Then as soon as the clock hit the mark, the door opened and the remaining three members walked in, Mr. Lazy only looked at their feet, he saw Mr. Danger come in and sit beside him.</p>
<p>“What's up?” Mr. Danger was smiling, “How's it going?” </p>
<p>Mr. Lazy didn't dare look up at him. “I'm alright”</p>
<p>“Is something wrong? Are you avoiding me?” Mr. Danger said. </p>
<p>Then Mr. Melancholy, laughed, he was sitting on the other side, “I think he's turning gay”</p>
<p>“Fuck me, I've already got a boyfriend” Mr. Danger said, “Unfortunately, otherwise I would like to go for him” They talked about him like he wasn't even there.</p>
<p>They sat through the meeting, Mr. Angry explained more details on what was happening, Mr. Lazy only dared to look up at Mr. Purple. She still sat cross legged without any change, she was the same as usual, she was always like that. He wondered if she was phased by it all, and was everyone here acting? Were they all afraid of something in the heist as well?</p>
<p>“Hey” Mr. Danger leaned over, “Let me give you something” Mr. Lazy tried to shrug it off, he didnt' want it.</p>
<p>“I'm not attracted to you, seriously, stop worrying, I know all you lot are afraid of me hitting on you, there's a vein of homophobia running through this whole hotel, but give me a second okay?” </p>
<p>Mr. Lazy finally looked up to see a smiling Mr. Danger. He was holding out his hand and inside it was a string of flowers tied together, he had made them on the spot from the flowers growing in the plain grass outside, and from the toiler paper in the bathroom.</p>
<p>“It's a bouquet” he said, “Isn't it nice?” he cocked his head like a woman, “Pass it on to your wife” he said, “I sense you're treating me differently and I don't like it, I want to be friendly with everyone here so I want to do something of kindness to everyone around me, starting with you” he smiled.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy didn't say anything, he didn't know what to say, should he be afraid here, very afraid, or should he fight back and stand up, or should he accept the kindness with more kindness.</p>
<p>“Just pass it on to your wife” he put the small bouquet of toilet paper and rotting flowers in Mr. Lazy's hand. </p>

<h3 id="twenty-two-imagination">twenty two: Imagination</h3>
<p>“Do you guys knows anything about him?” The girls were huddled in the corridor and talking. They were all housekeepers who had just gotten off work. They were talking about the door that never opened, William's room. They talked about him because their livign quarters were in close proximity with his, and they never saw him because their work hours were different. </p>
<p>“He's always out, but at night I hear sounds from the room”</p>
<p>“Sounds? Like scary stuff?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Curren, you're such a wuss, I mean sexual sounds. The stuff that makes you go crazy.”</p>
<p>“You hear that stuff in the middle of the night? Eww that's gross” She was a bit slow on the uptake of it.</p>
<p>“One time, I saw his door left open, I think he went to the bathroom to shave or something...”</p>
<p>“Wait, stop right there, you saw him shaving? Seriously, have you psychoanalyzed this guy ro something? Do you know everything he does?”</p>
<p>“I'm curious okay? He's my neighbour but I don't know anything about him, just lay off my case girl.” She was taller than her friends, and they all wore the same uniform. “He always has his door locked, so on the rare occasion it's open I take a look, yes, I'm nosy and invading his privacy and shouldn't be doing this, but if he were your neighbour, you'd do the same”</p>
<p>Lisa was laughing, “I would not” But while she said that, she knew she would.</p>
<p>“He didn't have anything in his room, not even a computer, nothing valuable, I didn't want to steal anything”</p>
<p>“You so did”</p>
<p>“Shut up, there were just papers everywhere, notes on everything, I'm telling you, I know a weird person when I see one, and he's a weird guy.”</p>
<p>“But he brigns girls over right? They all see his place”</p>
<p>“His room is weird, so he must have some other flavour that attracts these girls.”</p>
<p>“Like a huge dick?”</p>
<p>“Who are you kidding, why would an asian like him have a huge dick. Anyway, why does he keep locking his door if he doesn't have anything valuable in there?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he's just a private person, who cares, this is getting boring, wanna Shisha?”</p>
<p>“I looked through his notes” the same girl said, “And it was written so fast I coudlnt' understand it. But they were wrapped up like they were all valuable or something.”</p>
<p>Her friends left, “Who cares Curren, we'll see you at the bar, have a shower first you filthy creature”</p>
<p>“I will, and I'm not filthy, you're the filthy creature!” she said. She heard her friends still laughing as they went out. She had to get changed quickly to meet up with them. </p>
<p>Her thoughts naturally wandered to her next door neighbour. What if he was onto something really big, she saw it in Newspapers and things where people were onto really big things and no one ever paid them any mind, then they defied the world in the most unexpected ways. She pulled down her work clothes and pulled up her dress. She was over imagining again, she was probably just horny, that's why her mind kept wandering to that guy next door.</p>
<p>What if it was a lot of gold? She locked the door behind her. What if he had a plan to make a lot of money like in those heist films? Wouldn't that be amazing? Then his life really would change.</p>
<p>If that happened, she would be so excited, because it never happened in real life. </p>
<p>She struggled to lock the door, the key was always so rusty, she felt like breaking it in two and throwing the darn thing away. How much development did we have to have before keys could be made that wouldn't break?</p>
<p>If it was a heist with a lot of gold, she would pull the plug on them and hang them out to dry. That's what she imagined.</p>
<p>But there was no way it was a heist. She left the corridor in a whirlwind and walked out to go to the party. </p>
<p>Those things just didn't happen in real life.</p>
<p>In his room, just barely waking up from the late team meeting last night, William blinked and looked at the ceiling. It was a plain white ceiling, but the longer he stared at it, the more shapes he saw. They formed in front of him like a festival he was missing out on. Dragons with long tails, guns shooting missile bullets to his left and right, skinny dancers with hairy legs performing seductive moves for special clientelle. Then when he blinked, it was gone. </p>
<p>He heard voices outside, it was the housekeepers just getting off work, they were talking about their usual things, and about him as well. The walls were thin. He knew everyone was curious about him, but he didn't bother. </p>
<p>His neighbour unlocked her door, then a few minutes later the door locked again. They were all going out. William checked his watch, he was starting work very soon.</p>
<p>He stared at the ceiling and a different image came to his mind, it was something he was beginning to see more often. He was on a stage, teaching to a classroom. But the people facing him were people of all ages and nationalities. They looked at him all differently, but all with a general disdain of him and his beliefs and everythign he stood for.</p>
<p>Standing there in front of everyone in this classroom, for some reason he felt immensely guilty. He didn't know why, but it was overwhelming, as if all his life had been a mistake and a big sin that he was committing. As if being born here and being here was an absolute wrong that coudlnt' be rectified.</p>
<p>Then he saw the hopeful eyes of all the students, they had disdain and hatred pulsing through the veins, but they looked at him desperately for an answer. And he wanted to ask them, why he felt guilty.</p>
<p>“Even if you're serious about something and do all the thinking you want, if you don't have action, then nothing will be achieved. You can get people interested, buy their attention, but you have to have progress. You have to knock down goal posts one at a time, otherwise there is no evidence of progress.</p>
<p>Everyone in the class started nodding, touched by what he was saying, it wasn't even beautiful, but one woman in the back was sobbing and nodding to what he was saying. She was about thirty, and when William stopped talking and stared at her she started to look familiar. At first it was a curl of the hair, then the formation of her lips, the angle of her nose. He realized she looked like one of the women he knew very well, the woman who's breasts he had sucked and been nurtured on for the early portion of his life.</p>
<p>“I understand” the woman raised her hand. “You could be progressing without knocking any posts down, but you woudln't know, it's okay if it's yourself, but if it's someone else, then you need proof to show them that you are moving. If there are no signposts on an empty road then there's nowhere to go, and you're not going anywhere as well. It's a dead end.” She was crying the whole time she was speaking, she looked younger than the mother he knew, she was about twenty right now, before she got married, and before she had children.</p>
<p>For some reason her words penetrated his mind, there was so much truth there that gravity didn't feel like it existed.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, the malady that afflicts those without any goalposts, does anyone know what it is?” He said to the class.</p>
<p>A young kid sitting in the front and tapping her legs impatinetly raised her hand immediately, like a bamboo shoot.</p>
<p>“Is it blindness? Because you can't see anything”
Age doesn't matter with knowledge, and then he remembered that old saying that had been bounding about in the human psyche since the start of time. “I never thought of that, it's an interesting idea, but it wasn' the one I was thinking of” And yet we all age, for what reason?</p>
<p>A boy near the window, seeing the girl got it wrong, felt encouraged and stretched his hand up “Me, me me!”</p>
<p>William pointed to him and the boy answered immediately, as if William had pressed a remote control button to switch the channel or turn the TV on. “It's a lack of communication, human beings need to communicate with one another, and they can do this best when they do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>William laughed and smiled, “That's true” he said, “I never realized it, but it's true, but it's not the one I was thinking of either.” He felt like an impsoter standign in front of eveyrone here, they all knew more answers than he did, had better questions, and were smarter and wiser. So what was he doing here? He didn't deserve to have a place here.</p>
<p>An old woman at the back of the room grunted and raised her hand, she took her time and the classroom was quiet for a while, with only the sound of pages peeling and people ageing in the midst. </p>
<p>William chose her and she smiled, also like a remote control. “I know what you're thinking, it's to do with love isn't it? It's an ambiguous question you're asking us, but I think I got it, you can't fool me. You need to feel like your love is going somewhere.”</p>
<p>William's own answer, the answer he was looking for, was drastically different, he wanted to say the symptoms most fit depression, that's what he thought to say, but after everyone answered everything profound, he didn't feel like he should say it anymore. It didn't matter, knowledge was belittled in the face of more knowledge. </p>
<p>Then the bell rang and William looked to the window and saw the parents were all waiting outside. They were lined up and wanting to see their children. William looked at the older folk, the adults, and wondered how they were getting home, did they have parents here as well? Where would his dream take them?</p>
<p>As soon as the bell silenced, the huddle of parents burst in and huddled around William, demanding answers from him. When William tried to move a different parent filled the gap. He felt like a penguin in antartica during mating season. All of these parents were eager to jump in and complain to him, why are their kids learning about this, why did my son not come home last night? Does the teacher have a mobile number that's more private for sex anytime?</p>
<p>Then William opened his eyes, his alarm clock was ringing, it sounded like punches in the wall. </p>
<p>He thought about the dream, and he thought that he must be feeling guilty. Because this heist was serious theft, they were going to steal something that didn't  belong to them, and they were committing a sin. They could never come back from it, and it would be etched into their CV forever, and taken with them to the next life.</p>
<p>And so he was overwhelmed by guilt, and he didn't know if he could do it anymore. SO eh wanted to convince the others that he was doing the right thing, because if they believed him, then he would believe it as well.</p>
<p>William was surprised, because when he moved around, and stopped looking at the ceiling, he saw a woman lying in bed next to him. She wasn't snoring, she had blonde hair, and freckles covering her face. Her arm was blocking the bottom half of her face, and she had lipstick half smeared on her chin. </p>
<p>As if he had pressed a remote control button, she woke up. Her eyes blinked like a robot, and when she saw William looking back at her like a zoologist studying a new species and trying to classify it, she smiled. That was exactly what she liked.</p>
<p>“We finally did it” she said. She turned around and got out of bed. “You're working today?”</p>
<p>William groaned, he didn't want to answer any of this woman's questions, first he wanted to know who she was, and when she was leaving.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go for breakfast?” she found her watch on the side table and gripped it onto her wrist she laughed to herself, “Well, I guess it's not breakfast anymore...what are you having for dinner? The staff dining area?”</p>
<p>William did not want to be seen with this woman publicly. So he was calculating the best way to portray this particular slice of information to her.</p>
<p>“I'm just joking” she said, “I was going to meet up with friends, so you do what you like okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay” It was his room they were in. Did she think it was hers or something?</p>
<p>She stood up, putting her pants on, she cleaned up the bed a bit and leaned oevr to kiss William, but he moved his mouth away. “I would rather have breakfast first” he said, “Sorry”</p>
<p>Then she moved ot the window and looked out, she moved to his desk and started peeling through his books, then she looked down and opened his drawers.</p>
<p>William watched her do this, wondering when she would leave. He was dying to have her out of here.</p>
<p>“Did you draw that picture?” She pointed to the map on the wall. It was a map, not a picture.</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“It's a layout of the Management hotel”</p>
<p>“Hmm” She studied it with a finger to her lips, “So we're here now right?” She put her finegr on one spot and looked at William. He nodded without looking back at her. It didn't look like she was going to leave.</p>
<p>“How did you get here?” she said</p>
<p>“By bus”</p>
<p>“No, silly” she laughed, “You're so funny. So funny sexy and great.” She moved away from the poster and sat on the bed, looking around to help him find his clothes. “I mean, where do you come from? What brought you here? Where are your parents?”
She was trying to get to know him. William was so sick of this, it was always the same questions, and he answered in the same way, he knew where she was going to be amazed, where she was going to laugh, and where she was going to tear up and cry. He had done it so many times like a boring comedy routine. </p>
<p>“Where are you from?” she said.</p>
<p>“I was raised by two mothers, one is asian and one is white, of course their parental roles were different, and no, I have never met my father and I never want to see the bastard.”</p>
<p>“Wow” she said, “That's really different”</p>
<p>Which was a typical response, </p>
<p>“But if you had two mothers, was there one which was your favourite?”</p>
<p>“It's none of your business” he said. He genuinely didn't care, he was already sick of her, the elss about his life she knew, the better.</p>
<p>She sat there, obviously offended, but pretended to ignore the remark and looked for his clothes, she found a sock and gave it to him.</p>
<p>“Aren't you going to ask about me?” she said.</p>
<p>“Ask you what?”</p>
<p>“Where I'm from, what I want to do, you know that kind of stuff”</p>
<p>“Why”</p>
<p>“Because you're curious?” she said. </p>
<p>“No, I'm good” William put on the sock she offered him, he wondered if she would specify which foot. Then she handed him another sock she found, like it was a treasure hunt. The reward was warm toes and less smelly feet.</p>
<p>She found his shirt beneath the bed, then she found his scarf inside her handbag. She held it out for him, he took it and gave her his balls, which she stored in a small compartment in her handbag.</p>
<p>Then she went to his wardrobe, William tensed up. If she opened it...</p>
<p>She opened it and was hit by a shower of papers rolling out on her. Dry ink, and all sorts of pictures. William scrambled up and pushed her away with his hand, she fell to the ground and screamed. He ignored her and knelt down to hurriedly collect the fallen papers. She was groaning in pain, “You just pushed me, what's wrong with you? I was only looking around, can't you say sorry or something?”</p>
<p>William ignored her and stuffed the papers back in the wardrobe. He only answered her when the wardrobe door was closed and he made sure nothing else was lying around.</p>
<p>“Can I look inside this drawer?” she said. </p>
<p>“What for”</p>
<p>“Maybe in the future, I can put store my things in it, it'd be convenient...”</p>
<p>“No, sorry” he said.</p>
<p>“Aren't you at elast going to apologize to me then, for pushing me around like a bumper car or something?”</p>
<p>He ignored her and stood in front of the wardrobe, blocking her out.</p>
<p>“I want to know you better” she said, “I was just looking around, how come you have so many papers in your wardrobe, why don't you store your clothes in there. You're a freak with your things.”</p>
<p>She snooped around like they usually did, she acted like she didn't care at all, but she was asking the same usual questions they always asked. She was demanding stuff of him that was none of her business. They always tried to use this information to stick a foot in the door before it slammed shut in their face.</p>
<p>“Get out” he said. “Just leave”</p>
<p>“What?” She was stunned. Like she had never heard those two words used together before.</p>
<p>“I'm sick of you, I'm bored of you, I'm over you, I used you for sex. What do you want me to say to make you leave? I'll say it, just let me off.”  </p>
<p>She was stunned, the reaction was beyong anything. It was a calculation of what was to come next. She ahd never been treated like this before, was it rudeness? Was it bluntness? Was it inconsiderate? Was it loudness? She didn't even know, it was just beyond anythign she had ever prepared to face before.</p>
<p>She elft without a word, without a look in his direction, she only looked at the door handle, and then at the floor on the way out. She stumbled down the corridor like a cockroach and disappeared out of William's life.</p>
<p>All William knew of her came back slowly, she was a colleague from one of the hostels down the road, and her name was Paula Starr. And she always wore black from top to bottom, from inside to out.</p>
<p>William got changed and prepared for work, when he opened the door there was no one there, but when he looked down he saw Charlotte crouched against the wall and thinking. She was cross legged and in some kind of meditative position.</p>
<p>“Hey” she looked up, “I'm sad, can you comfort me?” </p>
<p>William eventually let her into his room, there was no trace of the other girl in here. It smelled frsh like a garden.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to talk to you” she said, “I missed you last night, we didn't get to talk” then she began talking, she sat on the chair, with her elbows on the desk, she faced the window, looked out at the grass, and the mountains beyond it, capped with snow on top like the world's biggets icecreams.</p>
<p>William sat on the bed in a similar place to where the other girl had sat. The sun shone over Charlotte's hair with a warm orange glow of the afternoon. It was like a heater that touched her drooping heart.</p>
<p>“I'm sad” she said, “Because I know we will break up. It's because I dreamed about it”She moved her leg uncomfortably and sat cross legged on the chair, still facing outside. Facing William was difficult. She had thought about writing a letter, but still wanted to see him.</p>
<p>“I dream about things before they happen” she said, “It's kind of like a Deyjavu, except it's not about big things, just small things like breaking up with someone, or meeting someone on the street, or buying carrots for dinner the next day. And it's just small things, but it's enough to ruin the excitement of life for a while” she said, “it's like you have a tablecloth and you wet it, and it's wet for a long time, although it was only a bit of liquid, the dampness affects me for a long time. So sometimes I'm livign in the future” </p>
<p>She finally turned to face William, and he noticed she was smiling. And at that moment she looked more beautiful than anything on earth, and William thought he was in love with her.</p>
<p>“We break up, not because of any reason” she said.</p>
<p>“You break up with me? Or me with you?”</p>
<p>“It just kind of happens naturally, but it's definitely not me” she said, “I would neve rbe able to do that” She looked down at the desk, at her fingers cradled just below her comfortably against the wood, “I like you too much to, I will never get bored of you”</p>
<p>Then William understood, why she was here, why she was telling him this. She was sad, because it was inevitable, no matter what they did, or how they acted, or how they hugged and kissed and respected each other and watched over each other, they were going to be apart. </p>
<p>Charlotte smiled. “You should sit in the sun, you're always asleep during the day” Then she stood up, and she was gone, the door closed quietly behind her. </p>
<p>William ran to the door and pulled it open, he looked down the corridor and she was gone. There was no trace of her presence ever being there. The moment she went to the other sid eof the door, she was gone.</p>
<p>He ran out of the building and turned a corner up the small hill behind their village. Then, he saw her, small against the myriad plants dancing about, the wind that picked up everything and jingled it with ease, and the huge blue sky that boomed like a gong overhead them. The hill was one patch of bright green that didn't match anything. She was slowly climbing the hill heading home, like a spec of dust. He ran up, higher and higher, following her path, treading her steps through the grass, growing closer and closer until he caught up to her and wrapped his arms around her from behind. When he felt her he was overjoyed, she was really there with him. He felt her stomach, felt her belly button under his fingers. </p>
<p>She collapsed to the ground on all fours, it was steep and they were almost vertical, and when she turned around she was crying. It was only when she spoke that he felt safe, that she was actually there, that she was Charlotte, and she knew him.</p>
<p>“Why do you do this to me” she said.</p>
<p>“You can't break up like that” he said, “That's too unfair. Just because of a dream.”</p>
<p>But there were sometimes that dreams covered more truth than reality, and were more penetrating than the deepest answers that the mind could explain, wiser than the thick flowing rivers or gusts of wind that pulsed over the earth like the scent of new fresh hair.</p>
<p>So they lay like that in a chaotic world, and after a while things became clear. “It's not so chaotic anymore” she said. </p>
<p>And for some reason he understood her.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-three">twenty three:</h3>
<p>In this chapter we begin to look a little  bit at the movement of the camera as a neutral object, and we begin to delve into topics of marriage.</p>
<p>Two minutes later William was at work. The world looked normal again, the colours had disappeared. Thirty minutes ago he had just kicked Paula out of his room, and three minutes ago he had been crying with Charlotte. Now, he was at work standing behind the counter and smiling at customers.</p>
<p>A minute later his boss came up to him and spoke quietly of things, basically, he was being told off for something. Afterwards he looked at this watch. It was hard to believe how little time had passed.</p>
<p>When William went to the reception to ask if they had any mail, behind the counter stood the woman he revered. </p>
<p>“Hi William” Annalise said. “We were supposed to meet up tonight, remember?”</p>
<p>When he went to put the rubbish out, he took the trolley past reception. Then the woman behind the counter smiled and waved at him “William” she said, “See you tonight”</p>
<p>William's blood rushed whenever he saw Annalise. But he was confused, because earlier today he had bonded so closely with Charlotte, and if he met Annalise now, it was weird. He just didn't know anymore.</p>
<p>After work she was waiting for him with a big smile. They met up outside the shop, she waved to all his colleagues, Jeena, Elizabeth and all the others who's names he hadn't yet learned and probably never would.</p>
<p>“So...how have you been?” she asked. </p>
<p>“Just as good as you” he said.</p>
<p>“See I love that, the way you talk, it's so different, you're qwuiet and respectful, and it's so comfortable to be around you”</p>
<p>“Oh really”</p>
<p>William with Annalise 1:</p>
<p>Eventually things moved to the bedroom. Annalise took him to her room, probably because she enjoyed more control of her own environment.</p>
<p>But she didn't go straight to it, she hid the goods and checked the conditions first. The weather was good, so that was a start.</p>
<p>Someone knocked on the door as William sat there, Annalise hurriedly got up and went over, she opened the door a tiny bit and stuck her head through like a sandwich. </p>
<p>There was someone outside asking her questions, talking politely, Annalise smiled and thanked the person, then she closed the door quielty, she came back in with a towel.</p>
<p>“We're all so close, Sharla lent me her towel”</p>
<p>Annalsie put the towel away neatly in its place. There was more space, William calculated how many more things would fit in her room. She was so prescribed, like medicine you could only get behind the counter. She looked at her self in the mirror briefly, then closed the window outside. She also double checked that the door was locked. </p>
<p>By the time she sat down she was a completely different person. Dead serious, like she had never laughed before. There was not a trace of a smile, she had forgotten those muscles back at the mirror.</p>
<p>“Let me interview you” she said.</p>
<p>William didn't know what it was that he wanted from Annalise. Was he with her because he liked her? What did she think of him? He had a crush on her, but he didn't know how important she was to him. How would she compare to Charlotte, or the other girls in his life.</p>
<p>“Are you here to have sex with me?” she said.</p>
<p>“Only if you want to” William said.</p>
<p>“I want to” Annalise said, “I've been planning for this, I really want to”</p>
<p>“All right then”</p>
<p>She pushed William away, firmly, that was the thing about Annalise, all of her actions were calculated, there were no mistakes. </p>
<p>“If we are going to be in a relationship, how are we going to do it in the heist?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, if we do the heist, won't it mess up our relationship? What do you think of that?”</p>
<p>“I don't think it's a proble, why would it be? We're both involed in it, so actually it's really beneficial for us if anything”</p>
<p>She thought about it and nodded. “Okay, you pass”</p>
<p>“Ha” he smiled. He didn't need her permission.</p>
<p>“Next question” she said, she was sitting on the bed in her work clothes, a suit with a hairpin holding everything together. He swore that if he puleld the hairpin off, an inner monster would be unleashed.</p>
<p>“When was the last time you dipped the wick?” she asked.</p>
<p>William couldn't say earlier this afternoon, so he closed his mouth and stood for reticence.</p>
<p>His taciturn reply invited her understanding. “It was that recent huh...Oh well. Not everyone is going to be perfect”</p>
<p>She said it like he wasn't perfect because he was sleeping around. He leaned oevr to touch her but she pushed him away. Andinstantly she started crying and pushing him more and hitting him.</p>
<p>“How many woman are you in love with?”</p>
<p>William couldn't be bothered anymore. “All of them”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” She had her palms on the bed propping her up towards him. </p>
<p>“I mean everyone is special”</p>
<p>She didn't answer, so he asked her, “Is that a pass”</p>
<p>“Wait, I'm still assessing the criteria”</p>
<p>She raised her finger to ask another question and silence him, even though he wasn't speaking. “Wait, how much do you love me?”  </p>
<p>“About three weeks worth of rent” he said.</p>
<p>She fell quiet, assessing that answer as well. And William felt like he was in a University interview being assessed on every answer he had, accompanied by smiles all the way.</p>
<p>“But am I the most special to you?” she said.</p>
<p>He wondered how many more questions were to come, how many conditions needed to be satisfied to get access to her? Was it even worth all this trouble?</p>
<p>William leaned forward to try and kiss her, but she pulled away, jus far enough so they were staring at each other quietly. She was tearing up again, but there was no change of expression. Her lips didn't move, only the strange liquid trickled down.</p>
<p>“Why don't you like me?” she said.</p>
<p>“I do like you, that's why I'm here” His answer astounded her.</p>
<p>“Then why do you do this to me?” she said, pulling back and standing up. “I dont' know why you do this again and again, if it was just once then I'd say it's okay. How about the other girl? Don'tyou like her?”</p>
<p>“I like her as well”</p>
<p>“Then why do you do this?” she said. “How about the other girl, how about her feelings? Don't you like her? Do you like me more than her?”</p>
<p>He didn't answer, and she became sad. He coudlnt' answer anything important, he coudlnt' confirm anything she wanted to hear. She wished she could forget about him.</p>
<p>“Why are you cheating on her?” she said. “Why do you deliberately hurt people like this?”</p>
<p>“I'm just living my life, you guys keep on pouncing on me and treating me like I'm yours or something”</p>
<p>She paused, “True, when you say it like that. So I should feel sorry for you?” She threw her fist in the air, on the bed, “But why do you spend so much time with Charlotte and other girls, and you don't contact me first, I always have to contact you, or else you're just going to be with that Charlotte girl. Even right now, because I called you out, are you still thinking about her?”</p>
<p>She didn't wait for an answer, because it was too painful to hear it, she just kept speaking, “I feel like I'm the one making more effort in this relationship, even though we both share secret of the heist together” She said the last part quietly.</p>
<p>“What's that got to do with anything?” He said. That had nothing to do with romance.</p>
<p>He came here to chill with her, instead of having a good time she was grilling him about his romances. He didn't know the answer himself, he didnt' know what was hapepning, he was just living. </p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” she said, “Communicate, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I'm bored and pissed off” he said, “That you're holding me back.”</p>
<p>That made her cry a third time. She cried like it was diarrhea, little short trickles that stopped as fast as they arrived. “I'm not trying to hold you back, I just thought there was something special between us” </p>
<p>“There is” William said, “And there's something special between me and all the other girls in my life, and all the other boys, and all the other things.”</p>
<p>“But I already told my friends, that we're really good together, and they think so as well. And they think you like me back.”</p>
<p>“What the fuck have your friends got to do with this?” William said.</p>
<p>“Just think about it, please” she said, “Your actions influence others, you're not livign in your own world.” </p>
<p>He felt like she kept changing tactics to try and persuade him, but he had had enough of it.</p>
<p>William sat back, realizing. He realized that his lfie was messed up, there were women all around him, all wanting a piece of him, all wanting him to stay for a long time, all trying to make him stay with them. All trying to buy him a house and stick their clothes in his fucking wardrobe. </p>
<p>And she was glad that he is thinking. So she quietly said bye and was leaving. “I guess I'll see you at the next meeting. Please give men an answer by then.”</p>
<p>“Is it still worth talking about it?” William said. He was going through two break ups in one day. He needed to find two more women to replace them now.</p>
<p>Then later Annalise heard that after the conversation she had with William, he went straight to another girl, one he hardly knew, and slept with her. </p>
<p>Annalise suddenly felt so left out. Was she just another girl he was trying to sleep with and conquer? Why couldn't he be more moral. Because they clicked so well together and got along so well, so why couldn't he just be faithful and loyal? She would never ever cheat on him, but he cheated all the time without batting an eyelash. Why couldn't he not do things like this that are so obviously going to hurt people. She just didn't understand it. Wasn't it so easy to prevent?</p>
<p>“Because I'm a guy” William said.</p>
<p>Then she cried, not because it was true, not because he was hurting others, but just because he genuinely didn't care. He so easily hurt the people around him, how could he be so mean to others and not realize it. We were all human right?</p>
<p>And still other new women fell for him all the time.</p>
<p>There was no punishment or justification. Annalise swelled up like a ball of pus.</p>
<p>When she tried to be a proud independent and strong woman as she was raised to be, and live up to the values she believed; it didn't work. She coudlnt' trust William, and when she tried to he just got with more and more other girls. So while she was being moral, she felt like she was being left out and everyone else was ignoring her for doing the right thing and continued to live their depraved lives.</p>
<p>Then what was it to be moral anymore?</p>
<p>There was a big white snow field, and a little girl was walking through it. She looked down from the snow field, she was on the top of a mountain without a footstep around her, the snow had stopped. She walked to the edge, and looked over. There was a small viallge with about thirty houses, and one big building housing a lot of customers. She had walked for twenty minutes, and when she looked back she saw how small it all was. She lived there, and it was evrythgint o her, all the arguments, all the stress, all the emotions, but just by walking twenty minutes away, it had all disappeared into nothing and was unimportant and trivial. That was all human life was.</p>
<p>When she turned back, the sun wasn't in her eyes and it was Elizabeth, William's colleague from work. She had her day off and was walking around.
She closed her eyes, put her hands in he rpockets as she walked back down, and hoped that she would run into a man before she reached home. She wanted to be with someone through the long and lonely nights.</p>
<p>Then she put on sunglasses, cut her hair, and walked down, compeltely convinced and sure of herself and who she was. She was a success.</p>
<p>She was a success all the way home.</p>
<p>Before she reached her doorstep, there was shouting on her right, it wasn't shouting, it was actually talking, but to Elizabeth it sounded like shouting. Because she didn't talk much and express her view like she wa supposed to.</p>
<p>She walked past it without hearing anything.</p>
<p>In the window, the sound had been captured and stopped, ice was collecting on the corners of the window and a finger rubbed it every now and then. Jason was standing next to the window and talking to Gerry.</p>
<p>“You shouldn't do that” They were both collected in Gerry's room like artifacts in a museum. “You're my friend so I gotta tell you this, I find it offensive that you would kiss a married woman.”</p>
<p>Gerry was stunned, “You just yelled at me, man that's cool. I respect that, it means we're close. I mean, you're gay and you kissed a married woman”</p>
<p>Jason “It's got nothing to do with my sexuality, you dont' ened to bring that up, gay or not, marriage is marriage okay? It's people like you who keep judging and moving us back to the stone age” </p>
<p>“Okay fine, but how about Mr. Melancholy. How come he can sleep with all these most beautiful women's and do whatever he wants but I can't?”</p>
<p>“If it's someone I don't know, then it's not my place to judge them. Because you're a closer friend to me, and I can't allow that with a close friend.”</p>
<p>“Then...” Gerry paused, his voice dropped, it was obvious he was weakly saying it, “What if I don't want to be your friend, then is it okay?”</p>
<p>“You would do that? For a little sex?”</p>
<p>“You say friends, friends, but what do we do together actually? Isn't it more like you just bossing me around, aren't we more of a parent-chidl relatioship? If this is all friendship is with you, then maybe I'd rather not have it” Gerry said.</p>
<p>“But isn't that the strongets bond in nature? Friendship” Jason said. “Besides, I'm married, and I really enjoy it, it's the hardest thing in the world, but it's worth it.”</p>
<p>“But I'm not your parent, and if it's just a little sex, then why do you say things like that? It's not a big deal right? What's it got to do with this strongest bond in nature, if it's so strong then why ar eyou going to break it over something so small.”</p>
<p>“Because I dont' respect Mr. Melancholy, or I do in a different way, but you're not him, if you do that I might lose repsect for you. And sex is the strongest bond in nature as well...”</p>
<p>“Then I don't want your respect” he said, “If that's all it's worth then I don't want it. And how can there be two things that are the strongest in nature?”</p>
<p>“But what's worth more than that? What do you want then? Do you think it's right, what you're doing? Woudl you be happy to live the rest of your life like that?”</p>
<p>“What I think has got nothing to do with what you think of me right?”
“No, if we're friends then it matters”</p>
<p>That was their conversation that Erlizabeth walked past and never heard. Jason and Gerry saw someone walking outside, but they didn't look closely, she was just another person walking outside. Jason was telling Gerry off for kissing one of his customers who he met up with secretly she was travelling with her husband but had kissed him. Jason firmly stood by fidelity and faithfulness. If there was no truth in a marriage then it woudln't work.</p>
<p>Jason opened the door and left Gerry's room, it was stuffy in there, the guy never opened his windows.</p>
<p>As he walked down the corridor the door next to him opened, and he was awkwardly standing side by side with a girl. He stopped and looked to his side and down, where she was beside him, he could only see the top of her head, but she was small and pale.</p>
<p>“Misty?” he said. “Do you live here?” He tried to look through her open door, but she snesed it and slammed it shut.</p>
<p>“Sorry” she smiled, her hand still on the knob.</p>
<p>“Is that your room? I didnt' know you lived here”</p>
<p>“I'm sharing it with Annalise” she said.</p>
<p>Jason grinned, her voice was cute, he had always found this girl attractive, but he was married. He felt a bit envious of her for being able to do whatever she wanted, a pretty girl like her could go anywhere.</p>
<p>They still stood there awkwardly, so he turned with his back against the wall, giving her some space, she did the same.</p>
<p>“Do you know who I am?” he said.</p>
<p>“Of course” she laughed, “You're Jason”</p>
<p>“I'm Jason” he said.</p>
<p>Then she laughed, for some reason she found what he said really funny. And he didn't know why. It wasn't even great. No one else he knew would laugh at something like that. But whens he laugehd like that, and was eager to hear what he had to say, he felt respected by her, she wanted to hear what he was saying.</p>
<p>“I always wondered who you were” she said.</p>
<p>“You knew me though”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it's weird isn't it” She laughed again. This time at herself. Thens he saw him laughing and began laughign even more. She was wearing a light green top with a frilly edge around her neck and shoulders. Her pants were casual grey cotton. It was nothing attractive, but the simplicity and openness of her was relaxing for him.</p>
<p>She was weird...in a good way. And he found himself asking her more and more questions, she answered everyone question, sometimes with just a yes or no, sometimes with a slightly longer answer, but she didn't talk much. She told him that she spent a lot of her time in her room under the covers and imagining things. He was intrigued, who did that?</p>
<p>Then as they were talking, the conversation turned to her friend who was asking about marriage. By now they were sitting outside on the steps, she spoke so quietly, and he sensed she was really excited to talk to someone, she rpobably didn't know it yet. He looked at her as she spoke and hoped that she would enjoy this time she spent with him when she looked back on it, because he was. It was so unexpected, he had never met her like this, yet they connected so easily.</p>
<p>“My friend is always asking about marriage” she said, “She's always asking these deep questions, long term questions, and she's really serious, but what she's most concerned about is that she might lose her personal free time. Afte listening to her for six hours one night, that's what it seems like to me, at least from what I'm hearing all the time.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Misty, you listened to someone for six hours?” </p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“That's a really long time to listen to someone you know? I'm married and I don't even listen to someone for that long”</p>
<p>She was shocked, “You're married?”</p>
<p>“You didn't know?”He read her reaction, she genuinely didnt' know anything that wasn't happenign around her, it was cute, but a bit concerning.  “I'm married to a woman called Laura, we've been together for a year and a half now”</p>
<p>“So your'e like a professional?” she said.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh she was cute...</p>
<p>“Misty, you're a good listener” he said, “that's what I wanted to say” she didn't respond, so he talke dabout marriagel, at elast what he thought about it. “You can understand a person from what they say, and also based on what they don't say when everyone else is saying something. You really have to investigate each other's character sincerely and honestly. You need to see them in different contexts, like how they are with kids, how they deal with stress, that kind of thing.” </p>
<p>She nodded slowly, deep in thoguht. “I never thought about that”</p>
<p>She treated him too well, like he knew what he was saying, he didn't know much, but she made him feel like some kind of wise man with a long beard to stroke.</p>
<p>“I told Laura that if she cheats, it's her loss, because I have tried everything and done my ebst, if she cheats, then she is going to be missing me. Of course I will miss her, but I will move on, we will both move on.” He sighed, “Okay, I'm done talking, you were talking about your friend, sorry for interrupting.”</p>
<p>“I think my friend is concerned about marriage, because she is thinking of ti, she recently got a boyfriend” Misty said, “But when she was telling me stuff, I didn't know how seriously I could answer, because she might tell others, or she might be offnded. But I also wanted her to know what I was thinking, it was difficult.”</p>
<p>Jason nodded, to him it was something normal, but he was intrigued by Misty, how she reacted to these small things and treated them so delicately, it was something Laura never would have done.</p>
<p>Misty went on, and by the time she was finsihed, she wiped her mouth and neck, it was like she was tired from just sitting up. </p>
<p>“I have never me tyour friend, I mean I have, but it's like I know eveyrthing about them without having ever meeting them or talking to them. Sometime si walk on the strete and some people look at me weirdly, because they know what I've done or said. It's like that, the infromation spreads faster than actually meeting people, that's our modern world, there's so uch infromation and not many people.”</p>
<p>“do something for me” Misty said, “When you see her on the street, say hi to her, she'll like it, it's really friendly and nice”</p>
<p>“But won't she get the wrong impression?”</p>
<p>Misty shook her head, “No....I don't think so? She will wave back to you, like she has emt you before as well. Because I will tell her everything about you that I know, it goes both ways you know. That's a small viallge town.”</p>
<p>He grinned, what she was saying was creepy, but the way she said it was only cute.</p>
<p>They said bye in the corridor, </p>
<p>“Is Annalise coming back soon?”</p>
<p>“She should be coming over the hill soon” Misty said. “And she's going to yell at me” </p>
<p>William looked up at the hill, it was a patch of green, small compared the the large white masses of the tall mountains all around them. “She doesn't seem like the type to yell right?” She wasn't from what he saw at the meetings, she was actually pretty tame. Mr. Purple seemed more of the type to yell.</p>
<p>“She doesn't yell, she just talks a lot” Misty laughed, “Like me today” she fanned herself, although it wasn't hot. She was just a little girl lost in the moment, enjoying the show presented to her here.</p>
<p>“If you want to know” Misty said, “Annalise went over the hill to meet her boyfriend.”</p>
<p>The way she said it, was like she thought Jason wanted to know, so she was telling him. She was pretty considerate to even go that far “Her boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“She's boyfriend girlfriend with William, William Weng, you know him?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, really well actually”</p>
<p>“Really? How do you know him, you guys don't work together”</p>
<p>“Oh, we meet sometimes, it's no big deal.” </p>
<p>“Oh. Well, their relationship is very rocky” she said. “I know everything” she giggled. “It's like the seashore. She tells me everything. Do you want to know more?” She was so excited to be able to portray this information to him, it was like she was longing to tell someone, anyone about it.</p>
<p>Jason was surprised that two members of the job were getting together. They had probably been together for a long time already.</p>
<p>They said bye at the corner of the street. Misty and Jason, then they went their separate ways. Jason back home to his wife, and Misty out to start work in a few minutes. It was only a brief encounter, but the flames of it burned deep in both of their hearts.</p>
<p>Misty felt strong emotions for this man, but she held them back. He was married, and marriage was the end goal. To ruin that for someone was...no she wouldn't think about it. She distracted her mind by thinking of her warm blanket back at home, she would tiptoe in at night after work and go and lay in her blankets and imagine things, read a book. She was thinking of setting up a lightbulb underneath the blankets even. It was fun, she could have a whole house under there.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-four-the-two-bosses">twenty four: The Two Bosses</h3>
<p>William sat there mesmerized as he watched Daniel at work. He went into one of the hotel rooms and came out with a handful of sheets, like a robot, he dumped them in a tray and then came back out with a new set of sheets. He moved faster than his colleagues. He came out with a broken lamp, which he put to the side, he came out with a huge bag of rubbish from the room. While William was watching, he and a group of two others progressed through a few rooms and came dauntingly closer to where William sat.</p>
<p>Daniel looked up once or twice to see William sitting there, he didn't greet him, the men didn't even nod, Daniel saw him like he was the couch. If he had been lying down naked, there would be no difference. </p>
<p>Was Daniel always this serious sat work? He had a no-nonsense attitude about him that screamed of formations and beauty.</p>
<p>Daniel saw everything, he saw the things that were not important, he saw the things that were important. He had an untiring attention to every detail. From housekeeping he was able to see the whole hotel and observe what was happening like an eagle soaring above the land looking for prey. He looked for loopholes in the system, small places he could take advantage of. </p>
<p>Because he channeled his concentration into these places, he was very quiet in daily life. He was so quiet that he could become a comedian. He had information about everything, now he had to mine through the data to find what was relevant and important and place a contextual meaning behind it. The elevator took seventeen seconds to get to the second floor, so what did that mean? The radio conversations always ended and started with someone's name, so what did that mean?</p>
<p>Daniel stood on the elevator, hardly blinking. It sank down to the lower floors where the cheaper rooms were. </p>
<p>“I don't think it works like that” the doors opened and two women got on. </p>
<p>“I heard he only started speaking when he was a teenager, isn't that strange?” </p>
<p>The two women got off and turned to the left. They both wore similar attire, pencil skirts cutting off just above the knees, pale brown stockings, and shiny black shoes. Their hair was different colour, and their names were probably different, that was about it.</p>
<p>Daniel walked past the front of the hotel, inside the cafe were the girls. There were four of them there, sometimes five if the night went well. They always went to the night parties because they worked during the day, three of them worked in housekeeping as well, and the other two were tour guides for the customers. They were significantly fitter.</p>
<p>Other than these girls, there were tourists, all sorts of people, they held cameras, they sat aroudn looking bored, they were fascinated by the scenery and looked out the window, tapping it to show that the clouds had moved and the tip of the mountain could be seen. There was an asian woman with a orange shorts waiting for someone, she was scrolling through her phone and looked up every few seconds for he partner. There was a family, with a daughter and kids.</p>
<p>Daniel lived just down the road in the staff quarters, but just through these doors not even one hundred meters away were all of the tourists admiring everything for the first time. It was hard to take in.</p>
<p>William walked in to the cafe, he also had his day off, he saw Daniel sitting in a corner watching everything and went over to him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“See those girls there, in the corner?” Daniel said and William looked. “I was watching them”</p>
<p>William sat down, and Daniel started talking. He talked quietly and in monotones. But the content was there.</p>
<p>“I'm watching everything, one of the girls waves and I watch how she waves. How her smile stands, where her gaze is. The girls are sitting at the tables far from the window with all of the tourists. I can't hear them but I know they're talking about the things that happened when they went out the night before. Who got drunk, who wasn't drunk, who hooked up with who, and who stayed unsatisfied.” Daniel grinned, “Watch this, the blonde woman on the right is talking right? She holds about 60% of the conversation, the other three share about 20% and two share 10%. </p>
<p>He speaks, and William was amazed and satisfied by his knowledge, he knows exactly what's going to happen, and when it's happening. He also knew what each person was going to do next, where someone puts their hands, where the other person puts their hands, the frequency of jokes, how long their conversation will last before they disbanded. He could read the flow of it all. </p>
<p>“Now, the woman on the left is going to stand up, upset about something, and she's going to go and order a coffee 90% and a tea 10% of the time. She's a passive aggressive type, and she really enjoys the company, but sometimes they take it a bit too far with her. The brunette with her back to us knows this, but she really enjoys the laugh, the blonde girl on the right doesn't know it, she's actually talking most of the time and doesn't know what's happenign in the group. They're all there for their own reasons. The woman on the left who is going to leave in about thrity seconds...” Daniel held his hand out, “Three, two one, now” The woman on the left smoothed out her pants and stood up, she looked around and went ot the counter to order something.”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” William said.</p>
<p>“It's a pattern, people live and die in patterns, once you've adapted to the pattern enough you're predictable. If you know someone's needs and a bit of their character you can predict their next behaviour and action. People aren't free, they're tied down by desires and thought patterns. It makes it easy to read.”
It was like he was talking about a chapter in a book or something.</p>
<p>“That's amazing”</p>
<p>“The woman, once she's gone, the others feel a bti uneasy listening to the conversation, so one of them will go to the bathroom, most likely the brunette, but there's also a slight possibility of the other woman with the red shoes going.”</p>
<p>Then, as he said it, the brunette stood up to go to the bathroom. She looked at us as she walked past with an arrogant stomp.</p>
<p>“She's going to come back” Daniel said, “And she's going to be a bit sad, because of something someone said earlier, so she's going to have heavier make-up on, probably on her lips and cheeks. It doesn't matter because she's not drinking coffee. She also probably feels a little insecure being with three other women, who all are very well dressed. They intimidate her, that's why she's wearing the red shoes, just to have anything to stand out.”</p>
<p>It really was like a chapter in a book. Daniel spoke so smoothly that he may as well have been looking down and reading a book, but he was looking at the table and speaking.</p>
<p>“She doesn't know it yet, but she's going to cross her legs and leave, I think she's going to stop hanging out with these women, they make her feel uncormfortable, so in the long run she's going to make new friends, and to do that she might even elave her job here. She's a housekeeper so it's an easy job to replace and be replaced”</p>
<p>William was completely amazed. It was like he was listening to a fortune teller show a future in front of him.</p>
<p>“That's what study is” Daniel said, “Everyone studies something, videos, people, books, knowledge, it's all a prediction for the future, and the more accurately you are able to make a future, the more reliable and valuable you are.”</p>
<p>“How about me?” William said.</p>
<p>“What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>“About in the long run, what do I do and where do I go?”</p>
<p>“After the job” Daniel said, “Only because you said you really wanted to know, I'll tell you. I've observed you as well, and after the job, you're going to miss it all. All of this, this cafe, this whole hotel, all of the friends, the proximity of it, the diversity or people, and the conversations. You're even going to miss your boss who you hate so much right now. You'll think that eh was really good for you”</p>
<p>“Really?” William said. He coudln't imagine it. But then it sunk into him and he felt like crying. That really sounded like him. This man in front of him, staring back at him innocently, he really could see the patterns in William's life, that even he himself coudlnt' see.</p>
<p>“Trust me, it's not nice, you'll probably miss it for the rest of you life”</p>
<p>“That long?” William said.</p>
<p>“This is a beautiful spot, nothing in the world compares to it.”</p>
<p>William's tone suddenly dropped like the bass “Then why are we robbing it? Aren't we ruining it?” Then he sat back, “Did you predict that question I would ask as well? Is that why you're always bored?”</p>
<p>“No” Daniel said, “That question was you. I can't explain the heist to you, I can't explain my motives, I can only do my actions and hope they are coherent with my beliefs. ”</p>
<p>“Then what are your beliefs?” he said. “Can you predict anythign about yourselfint he future, if you can read everyone else so well, how about yourself?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” Daniel said it, and he slowly smiled, it was so subtle that seeing it was like trying to figure out integral calculus. “I don't know anything about myself. So this upcoming job is an adventure for me. Don't worry, after the job you will never have to see me again.”</p>
<p>“How do you know all of this?” Now William felt a bit intimidated, and useless in front of this man. He felt like his life had been wasted, like he had no talent in anything to uphold.</p>
<p>“Now I take these minute details, this observation, who is most likely to complain about something, who's likely to start speaking first, or stand up first, or exit the room first, based on the circumstances like the weather, or what shoes, or the shape of the room. And I take this mental framework, and I put it into a professional heist. Then and only then do you have an infallible plan.</p>
<p>And William trusted Daniel fully now. Even if everyone else didn't, he decided that he would. “Is that okay?” he said “Is it okay for me to trust in you, to believe in you and what you say?”</p>
<p>Daniel didn't answer, “It's up to you what you want to believe in, don't put the responsibility on others. No one wants that responsibility”</p>
<p>When they all met up at the meeting, Mr. Melancholy was proud to have this group to meet up with, because in a way they were all going through things together. He was happy to see everyone come in, Mr. Purple stood in the corner, Mr. Lazy sat down next to her. Mr. Chatterbox was talking to Mr. Danger about some movie, and William sat in the middle of the room, trying to observe everything.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Angry walked in and the dynamic changed. </p>
<p>First Boss:</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox couldn't find the location of the meeting room. It was written down, but now her phone was out of battery and she couldnt' ask anyone about it at this time fo the night. All she knew about it was that it was next to where the night porter would be. </p>
<p>As she thought that, a black car with bright headlights passed her, the night porter was sitting inside going on her routine scout. Annalise followed the car then waved out and hopped on.</p>
<p>It was with mixed feelings that she approached the meeting place. She was excited to meet William again, but she was also afraid fo the heist progressing. And Mr. Angry was scary and untrustworthy as well.</p>
<p>Melanie sat in the van, she saw Annalise waving her hand and stopped. Annalise hopped in and they greeted each other, Melanie was happy to have the company. I'm so popular, Annalise wants to spend time with me. We can have some good chats here.</p>
<p>“Where are you headed?” Melanie said.</p>
<p>“Just to do some study” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“Are you going to be studying William?” Melanie said. But she regretted saying it as soon as it was out of her mouth. She was busy driving, but from her peripheral vision she saw Annalise stunned and shocked, like it was none of her business to ask. Annalise had frozen, and no microwave was going to defrost her.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, it's just that everyone knows, and I thought I would ask” Melanie said. “Was I out of line?” Annalise was more shy than she imagined. She was always talking and extroverted with her friends, she had a lot of friends. But it seemed like when it came to relationships, she kept them to herself.</p>
<p>“Does everyone know?” Annalise said. </p>
<p>“If I know, and I work nights and hardly socialize with anyone, then everyone must know.</p>
<p>Annalise looked down at the glovebox, “I'm kind of happy everybody knows” she said, then she looked up, forward out to the sky in front of them, the huge starry sky that stretched over them like a dream, made all of them seem so small. She stretched her arms out like a yawn, “I'm really happy that everyone knows.”</p>
<p>“But he's a player” Melanie turned the wheel to the right and miraculously, the car followed. She switched the indicator on at an intersection. There were no other cars around them at this time of night. But she waited at the GIVE WAY sign with the indicator on. Then, with force, she pulled out and onto the main street. They drove along with the white lines in the middle of the road pulsing through the car, and then running out behidn them, they curled and straightened like snails and they followed them all around the road. Melanie was driving fast. Stray hairs kept leaping out onto the road, the baby hares weren't fast enough, it was like they were playing a game of red light green light, and trying to get across. A lot of dead hares were on the road.</p>
<p>“That was too far” Annalise said. “That was none of your business”</p>
<p>Melanie slowed to let a baby hare pass, then when she sped up an odler hare laped across. It was relentless, at this time of the night the road was for the hares, forget about vehicles.</p>
<p>“I know” she said. The van skidded to a halt in front of the hotel, the sign Management hung in twittering gold, it was still glamorous in the night.</p>
<p>Annalise got off and walked fast towards the entrance. The door opened after her second try, and she stepped into the hotel. </p>
<p>Melanie watched for a while, before driving around for another scout of the village before going back to watch her movies. She thought she was so popular, but they were just using her...</p>
<p>Annalise walked along the corridor, she was late, if Mr. Angry found out she was on the night porter's van he would have a fit. No one was supposed to know about these meetings.</p>
<p>She pushed open the door, hoping to see everyone. But the door opened, behidn it was nothing, just an empty room.</p>
<p>Where had everyone gone? She walked down checking the other doors.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox?” Mr. Lazy walked past her, he stopped and saw her, he was wiping his hands on his pants, the toilet flush could be heard behind him. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Where's the meeting room”</p>
<p>“What meeting room?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>It took her a while to get it...</p>
<p>He motioned for her to follow, “Don't slack, remember that we can't be heard talking about this, don't be so casual about it”</p>
<p>She nodded, sorry.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy led her down a few more turns, past guests' rooms. They went down the stairs. “If you hadn't run into me there would you be able to find the room?”</p>
<p>“Probably not” Annalise said, “I'm really grateful”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy didn't say anything, and she thought he was rude. She was really grateful to run into him, but any other guy would have been better, this guy was kind of a snob, she could only imagine what kind of woman he was married to and feel sorry for her.</p>
<p>Then she imagined Misty at home, right about now Misty was probably under the covers reading something. She was seriously depressed, Annalise needed to help her out.</p>
<p>And when she got home Misty would ask her where she had been, and she would have to lie and say it was William.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy knocked at the door, he stood and looked at Annalise. She tensed up and looked abck. He looked back at the door, they stood there for seconds, which felt like a long time.</p>
<p>The door finally opened, Mr. Danger's face showed, “Oh, Mr. Chatterbox is with him as well” he called into the room. Mr. Lazy and Mr. Chatterbox walked into the room. Mr. Chatterbox looked around at all the faces and was relieved. Everyone was here, they really were all gathered. It was really lively as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was talking to Mr. Purple, he grinned when he saw her. Mr Danger sat in the side fo the room talking to Mr. Angry. </p>
<p>She sensed it, they were all growing closer, the conversations flowed easily and were more intimate, everyone, although they would be criminals soon, they were willing to share information about themselves, it was a trustworthiness in the team.</p>
<p>But Mr. Angry was not.</p>
<p>“Mr. Angry” she said. </p>
<p>He looked up, he had the saem weary look he always had, the look that said Fuck you, fuck this, fuck the world, and I'm bored</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox?” he said. “How can I help you?”</p>
<p>“You got something wrong, again” Mr. Chatterbox sat down beside Mr. Purple, she wanted female support for something like this.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry's expression never changed. “You are late Mr. Chatterbox”</p>
<p>“You said the meeting spot was over in the other wing” she said, “That's why I couldn't find it”</p>
<p>“Everyone else found it fine” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Shut up, I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to our dear leader who makes us follow every rule he makes with no questions asked. I couldn't find this meeting spot, it was lucky I ran into Mr. Lazy who led me here safely.”</p>
<p>“What's the danger, what's the safety for? We're in a hotel for goodness sakes” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“If we want to maintain the secrecy of this location, then we have to do this” she said. “It's a risk that we have to go through each time we gather together. If anyone checks the cameras they're going to see us.”</p>
<p>“The GM is asleep at these hours” Mr. Angry said, “He doesn't check the cameras after eleven or twelve.”</p>
<p>“Then what about last time, when there was a guard walking around outside, what if he had decided to come in here, while all of our plans were laid out on the floor like a death trap.”</p>
<p>“I knew he would be walking there, I knew at what time, I knew what he was doing, and what he was after. I fyou know these things about someone you know a lot, enough to know their environment.” Mr. Angry smiled, “And that's why we were already in the meeting, correct? You have to be here when I tell you to, not a minute early or late, because as in so many things, there are risks involved, and I have organized the narrowest window of opportunity for all of us.”</p>
<p>“Just in case” Mr. Angry said, “Before any of you arrive, I always have Mr. Purple set up fake scenes in the cameras that are transmitted automatically. So even if they do check the cameras, which 96% of the time no one will, but in the 4% of the time that the GM does check the cameras, we've got a backup system in place”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Mr. Purple, she nodded.</p>
<p>That was relieving for them, Mr. Angry had precautionary measures. “Just lay back and relax and enjoy the journey” Mr Angry said, “I have planned out everything, every problem that we might run into, and every success as well, the reason I designed this heist in the first place is because the success far outweighs the risks involved. </p>
<p>“The other day” Mr. Chatterbox said, “When you gave us the masks, some of them were ripped, they weren't even handled properly, they're a hazard. Besides, after we left the room you forgot to turn the light off. You don't  have everything organized, you say you do, but actually you don't. I know.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple nodded, “Mr. Angry sometimes comes into meetings late, even after telling us to be there at an exact time, and he's always thinking nad he never tells us what he's thinking.” Mr. Purple spoke about him like she was speaking to the group, and it pissed Mr. Lazy off. Why coudln't she speak to him directly?</p>
<p>“Mr. Angry, it's not just one or two things, all the time you're being unreliable, even the most basic things that should be perfect, like security, you claim to know so much, but you have no awareness of people waking up in the night. I walked past so many guests just coming here, what did they think of me? Hopefully they would think I'm just another guest”</p>
<p>“You're not trustworthy” Mr. Chatterbox said, “You're getting things wrong all the time, it's just small things, but they all add up.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy sat back watching, they were taking a small mistake Mr. Angry made and amplified it so much and put all of the blame on him like he had done everything wrong. William had never seen Mr. Angry make any mistakes, he hadn't looked for any. And it was only because of Mr. Angry that they were gathered here right now. </p>
<p>He watcehd Mr. Angry and wondered hwo he would react, he wanted to explode from all of the injustice Mr. Angry ahd to go through from these two cunts.</p>
<p>But Mr. Angry never exploded, he didn't even swear.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry if I upset you two” he said, “I'm human, I will get things wrong here and there, now and then. But I don't think I've made any major mistakes like you say, to make you question my authority here. If it's the heist you're dissatisfied with, say so, and I will leave, but I'm afraid I can't replace my authority here, that is my doing, I need to be a part of this heist.</p>
<p>The mature way in which Mr. Angry handled it was impressve. If world issues could be handled in this manner, then maybe there would be no reason for missiles. Although they were going to be thieves... </p>
<p>Then Mr. Angry spoke, “It's hard being the boss, it's one of the hardest things. When you look at a pride of lions, it is one male surrounded by the females who follow him around. He leads the way and protects them, they are his vital assets. But it's hard being the leader, especially when all of your women are going to complain about every small thing you do, they watch every action, let the ones they like slide, but note down the ones they dislike, all for a fireworks display of what they dislike later on. And it's easy to hate people, it's easy to ignore people and dismiss them and say they're wrong, but if you look at each one of the people lodging these complaints, they are proper people with their own characteristics, with their own unique way of intercepting the world and seeing it, that's why, as a leader, it's important to value this”</p>
<p>“Did you know that the male lions get dominated and ripped apart by opposing lions who gang up on them. Whichever males turn out to win, from whichever tribe, the females will all follow the winning lions. No one says a thing, that's just the way it works in nature.”</p>
<p>“When you yell and talk to everyone about you and me being together” Mr. Melancholy said, “It raises unnecessary attention. Coudl you please stop?” He spoke after everyone was silent, he wanted to put his own two cents in to Mr. Chatterbox.</p>
<p>Wow, that came out of nowhere, she gritted her teeth, he was just taking the opportuniity when everyone was against her to yell at her, she wouldn't take it, she'd dish it back out to him. “And you meeting up with so many of these women, how is that not risky behaviour? You're letting more and more women know how unreliable you are, and you have to sneak out from their beds every night because you have to catch these meetings”</p>
<p>Everyone became silent, it was clear where this was going.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox, what is it you are so dissatisfied about, is it my conduct in the group? Is it something that will cause a real hazard to our operation? Or is it your personal grudge and misdemeanor towards Mr. Melancholy.”</p>
<p>“You're not trustworthy Mr, Angry” she said. “I don't trust you, I didnt' trust you much at first, and every meeting we have, I trust you less, when you analyze everything like it's a logical equation, when you predict everything, I dislike it, it's disgusting. But I'm here because I agreed to this, I will live up to my word. But if, at any time in the process, you cut me, you lie to me, or you cheat me, I will come after you” she said, “And I won't stop, I will destroy your life”</p>
<p>The room had become so silent that it was only everyone's breathing. </p>
<p>“That's fine with me” Mr. Angry said, “Because I will not cheat you ever. I will not cut, lie, destroy anyone, I am telling you eveything I know and the truth. If that isn't enough for you, I can't offer you any better, if that makes you angry, I'm sorry, but it's my way of dealing with things and understanding things. It will be like this from here on, there are no surprises, everything is written in your scripts for the heist. Is that okay with you Mr. Chatterbox? This is my way of doing things, are you okay with that?” </p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox wiped her eye, “Yes, your way of doing things is good enough”</p>
<p>“Good” Mr. Angry looked around, “Then shall we start?”</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mr. Melancholy asked Mr. Angry privately about the speech he had said. “The one about the lions”</p>
<p>“The one about the lions? Oh that” Mr. Angry said.”What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>“That was really inspirational” Mr. Melancholy said. “But did you mean it?”</p>
<p>“Remember the four women in the cafe? Remember how I predicted every action?” Mr. Angry said, “It's standard procedure, in that situation with mr. Purple and Mr. Chatterbox against me, mainly because of gender differences, that was the best thing to say. Well, it wasn't the best thing to say, it was the second best thing to say. The best thing would have been a bit inappropriate with everyone around. But to answer your question, yes, it was calculated.” He turned to Mr. Melancholy, there was no life in his eyes, he was bored.</p>
<p>“I know what to say to persuade people to comply, people are robots, the only difference is that robots know they dont' have free will, people don't. Everything I say is calculated to create an effect, and Mr. Chatterbox and Mr. Purple listened to it and heard it, then they felt the effect and stopped complaining and complied. I say whatever I want, people cry in some places, they laugh in some places, but none of it is unpredictable. </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy said, “How about now? Is this calculated as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I live and breathe calculations.”</p>
<p>“Let me ask you another question, can I?” Mr. Melancholy said. “If I can still trust you, with what you say”</p>
<p>“Just because someone says something different, or that you don't like, or is over your head, doesn't mean you can't trust them, it doesn't mean they are lying, it just means they are good at what they do, and if that creates tension, it creates tension, if it doesn't it doesn't, the wind keeps blowing anyhow”</p>
<p>“I heard from somewhere about your motivations for this heist” Mr. Melancholy said. He noticed they were the only ones in the room, everyone had left. Mr. Angry was sittingin the exact same position, unchanged, he looked relaxed, and yet impermanent at the same time. “Apparently you confessed your weakness, and it really sounded like something you would say”</p>
<p>“What is something I would say?” Mr. Angry said, “I only say what you want to hear, or what I want you to hear. As if there's things people will say”</p>
<p>“You talked about how you tried three times...”</p>
<p>“It was like this” Mr. Melancholy interrupted, “I was talking to someone it doesn't even matter now, but it was like this, “I tried, I told you I tried, three times, but she wouldn't marry me. So this is what I'm doing it for, I don't know what any of you are doing it for, and I'm going to tell you again that I don't care. But you have to make sure to do the job. You can't make a woman change her mind. </p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked up at the roof, then back down, “No matter what I did, the attraction was absent for her and she was only liking me as a friend, nothing more. She couldn't help it either, she could try her best, work hard to cry about it that she didn't like him more, but it wouldn't change anything, no amount of tears or effort would change her feelings for me, or mine for her. It was something written down that was bigger than us. Your emotions are not you, they have a strong heartbeat of their own under the sun.”</p>
<p>“But you said people are predictable” Mr. Melancholy said, “Their emotions are preidctable, everything is calculated, so why coudlnt' you calculate this?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, for the first time William had ever known him, Daniel looked alive. He made a bigger smile than any of the smile she had made before, and he even laughed. “you got it” he said, “the purpose of my life right now, it's love. This heist, this team, everything, it's all love. I've found something that satisfies me, confuses me, something I don't understand, and I'm desperate to cling on to it. You're right, everything is predictable, but only this wasn't I didnt' see it coming, and that's why I've organized everything, this is all to see what happens once I get to meet her again. It's love, the ultimate unpredictability, love is what brought us here on this earth, love is the first and last things we will be.” </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was astonished, “That's amazing, you've got a real purpose, I'm really happy for you”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry turned back to him, his eyes were not glazed, and his mouth was the same bored shape. His nostrils breathed in air into his deep body, and it came out heated up and diffused..</p>
<p>“But I didn't say that” he said, “I just said what I wanted you to hear, I never said anything even mildly close to that, or even referenced it. Just now I made up something that you would probably like to hear. It's because you're looking dfor something to hold onto aren't you? That's why you have so many women in your life, you think the next one, or the next bit of sex is going to show you something that the last one didn't, you think the next friend you meet will be somehow more special. The truth is, and I think you're realizing it, everything is the same, there's no differences. If you're feeling this way now, in ten years, twenty years, on your deathbed, you'll probably be feeling the same way. We never change, even if you take your brain out and put someone else's inside in its place, you still won't change. That's how permanent we are.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you want to know something more?” Mr. Angry said, “I found this out a while ago, but our happiness is also always the same. Every now and then you become happy about something and elated for a while, then it falls as you get used to it, and you become sad about something else for a while. This just keeps going on and on, until you've repeated it enough time and you're dead.Your level of happiness is set. What's so ironic about it is that we try to climb out fo this by saying the enxt thing will make us happy, I want a car, I want a house, I want more money, a higher salary. And everyone believes this will make them happy. Some people say material things don't make you happy, so they turn to the spiritual, or whatever their perception of that may be, they say prayer makes them happy, they say doing kindness to others will make them happy, or they say forgiving others will, or meditating and being at peace with oneself and renouncing the world. Some others reject this as well and say that being drunk will, or stealing someone else's things will, or being so high that you can't experience the world and havemoved to a higher plane, or even finding the enxt relationship. Who knows, everyone finds their happiness in their own ways, their needs must be satisfied, otherwise they self destruct. And with so many people in the world, there are less resources for needs to be satisfied on. But it's ironic, because no matetr what you do, if you chase these ambitions for more, or stay still and not do anything and sleep all your life, your level of happiness remains the same”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy felt insulted, and in a strange way, he felt like perhaps this was what mr. Angry was aiming at. He had no idea what Mr. Melancholy was thinking, but a deep sense of hopelessness and helplessness overcame him, and he wondered if Mr. Angry was saying this to make him feel this way, or was he saying it because he sincerely felt it. Either way, it was a bad feeling, because it meant he was not going anywhere. </p>
<p>“So” Mr. Melancholy spoke slowly and full of thought, “If it makes no difference what you do, if you're going to die no matter how you live your life, then why do you bother? Why do you even organize this heist if the end result doesn't matter or change anything...?” He held onto the question, “Please be wary of your answer Mr. Angry, because right now I am really sensitive to what you're going to say, and I might become really upset, or really happy depending on how you choose to answer.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I don't know what's going to happen, that's why I want to try it, maybe I'm doing it for you guys as an experiment to see how all of you act in extreme circumstances, maybe I'm desperate for money, maybe I want to fall in love with this woman. Are any of those what you wanted to hear?”</p>
<p>“Can you answer it like this?' Mr. Melancholy said, “Since you never speak what you think and only speak what others want to hear, or what you want others to hear; then can you tell me something comforting so that I can sleep well and dedicate myself to this heist with no questions of doubt?”</p>
<p>“Because we're going to become so rich, and we're going to be powerful and be able to change the world” Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Melancholy was embarrassed, he saw a naked tear drip down his cheek, he wiped it with the outside of his hand. “Good” he said, “That's what I wanted to hear.” He wiped his cheek again, this time with his sleeve. “Now don't say anything more. I fyou leave it at that I will be able to respect you more.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry had a weird sensation. He never bonded with people, he was a chameleon, he never engaged sincerely, but for some reason with this man completely under his control, he felt exrtremely sorry. He was crying over the things Mr. Angry was saying, because he believed inMr. Angry so much. What was scary was that Mr. Angry didn't even believe in himself, he had nothing to believe, and to see others believe in him was to see their emptiness, and he felt so sorry for Mr. Melancholy who was investing so much into their friendship.</p>
<p>He wanted to tell him not to believe a word he said, “I never said that, nothing like that, nothing even mildly close or even referencing it, so don't listen to me. I'm more messed up than the both of us together.”</p>
<p>“I'll put my faith in you, I always did, but now I will put it in you” Mr. Melancholy said. “I think that we can become good friends. And I will put my faith in you to get rid of the system, the things I dislike, and we can reap the benefits from it. Now I really believe it is good and the best choice we have, not just for us, but for everyone.</p>
<p>In the store the next morning, William had hardly slept, he still had the moral code running through his mind, and now was becoming completely dedicated to the heist. Daniel had put details in the heist of the store, and he wondered how did Daniel know about all of these small things, when he hardly ever came around here.</p>
<p>“William?” Black came up to him from behind, his posture was straight and he looked like a boss from far away. If the aliens were to use their telescopes and look at the hotel, they would be able to instantly recognize Mr. Black as the boss. “He's the boss, he's the boss!!” they would say in their alien language.</p>
<p>Second boss:</p>
<p>“Can I have a chat with you, just a catch up”</p>
<p>So William sat in front of Black on a stool, the boss said, “You're useless, you need to work properly, this is an insult to you, everyone else around you is workign hard and fast and properly and just a pleasure to be around. William why don't you smile? A customer own't want to buy things from you if you don't smile. And make sure you smile sincerely. Serisouly, at this rate you're good on paper but you're a horrible person to work with, you need to bring your brain to work okay? Understand?”</p>
<p>William nodded. </p>
<p>“Is that a yes or a no?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“Good”</p>
<p>William put his hand in his pocket to check for the piece of paper he was writing on. In the store he always wrote down things as he was thinking them. Thing sabout the heist, even peoples' names were on it. He had to make sure it wasn't lost and no one read it. He stored it in his rooms with all fo the other papers and maps. He wrote about Black in it, and Mr. Angry, and which female customers he found attractive, and what he did with Annalise or Charlotte last night. What hepepend with the items in the store, a rude remark from someone, or a joke someone said that was funny, he notated it all down like a journalist of the store. Except, no one knew he was doing it.</p>
<p>“Alright?” Black said.</p>
<p>“Okkkaaayyy” William said.</p>
<p>When he got home that night he received a call from his parents, Mum said she was coming over to see him tomorrow-ish. “I want to see you in your natural habitat” </p>
<p>There was a pause, “Also, your father quit his job, so we can't support you anymore, you have to live on your own income now, you have to support yourself, do you think you can do that?”</p>
<p>William's friends were surprised he wasn't already doing so. They were sitting in the staff lounge, it was earlier today, and Daniel hadn't come in. He was talking to one guy from reception and a porter. Both guys he walked into a lot but never really talked to.</p>
<p>“Also, my girlfriend's birthday is coming up and she wants something expensive. She doesn't care what, as long as it's expensive.</p>
<p>“Oh, you've got one of those”  the porter, Greece Marlian said. “Those women are crazy in bed, they'll do anything for you, but they cost a ton. They're like a car that you need ot maintain really well, and give it pure high quality gas, and it runs fast, but eats up all the fuel.”</p>
<p>“Which girlfriend is this?” the guy from reception said. He knew William went around a lot.</p>
<p>“Oh, do you get around a lot with the ladies?”  Greece said.</p>
<p>“I get around, it's stress relief from a shit boss”</p>
<p>“Here comes the boss bashing, beware” The reception dude said. He was enjoying this whole conversation, listening to William like he was a Youtube video.</p>
<p>“My boss is rude, he's not tolerant, everything has to be done in a small narrow way, and he stands over your shoulder and watches, anything eh doesn't like he tells you to stop. Can you look at me when I'm talking to you. Kind of thing”</p>
<p>“Your boss is Mr. Black right? Yeah, he's not very popular with...anyone” Greece said. “When us porters have to deliver stuff to him, he just doesn't respond or something, but as soon as a customer comes in he treats them like they're diamonds.”</p>
<p>“He's two faced, he criticizes us all about our work, but when he's doing the jobs himself, he gets everything wrong, and everyone talks about him behidn his back.”</p>
<p>“But isn't that kind of mean” </p>
<p>“It's mean, but it's what is inspired. And there's no respect for him either, because he's so naggy about a few cents changed at the end fo the day, if the money from the till's even slightly off he looks and accuses everyone and makes them try to fix it. So the team has got a wallet where any leftover money they put in the wallet together, and any money not leftover they put away. They sometime suse that money to buy breathmints, because there's always some left over. And he finds out about me from my friends, the people who I talk to and ask questions about, then he has found out about me, instead of asking me directly. It's weird, then he's judging me based on what tohers have said about me. This corporate culture thing is so weird and nasty.” William was on a roll, he felt all of this hatred coming out like squeezing the pus out of a swollen bubble that had burst.</p>
<p>“Besides, we're supposed to report to him at all times, but he wasn't here for the past week, and ti was good because there wasn't anyone there to criticize my every action. But we coudlnt' get anything major done”</p>
<p>“It's not easy being a boss” The dude from reception said, “I don't think it's easy trying to manage a very diverse group of people in a way that makes everyone happy. He's probably working with about ten different cultures, with people of different ages and expectations as well. That's like what a Saint does to manage the world and create peace. And I heard he was getting married, he was engaged for a while, and now he's finally getting married to the love of his life, that's probably why he was away all weekend”</p>
<p>“She's probably ugly” Greece said, “I can't imagine any beauty hooking up with him, he looks like a pig. That's why he treats everyone horribly at the job as well. Tough luck for you William, for working that department, you should move to ours, it's a lot better, there's no one like that.”</p>
<p>“I don't understand” the guy from reception said, he didnt' hang out with them much, and William was starting to get a feel of why. “What has his looks got to do with his job? And how can you ever hope for bad things to happen to someone? It's people like you guys who would ruin another person's life”</p>
<p>William had never felt he was saying anything bad, he was just expressing himself, and these guys were willing to listen. But now this guy was saying things about them. He didn't even know them.</p>
<p>“Actually, I went to Mr. Black's house for dinner recently, and he was married and was actually a really great guy, doing the cooking and everything at home. He's just another guy who's trying to support his family and trying to secure his job and avoid any mishaps. Who isn't like that? If you go up to him and insult him, he will feel like you're a bad employee, of course, because he trusted you to do a job, and everyone else is doing it but you can't, so of course he says those things.”</p>
<p>“Whatever” William said. </p>
<p>“Don't be so immature, one day you'll grow up and understand”</p>
<p>“Fuck off, my life is none of your business, who are you to tell me how to live my life? I know what I'm doing. Who the fuck are you anyway, I don't even know your fucking name, your'e just another slave who works in reception and regurgitates everything that is told to you. You're another guy who's dead for eight hours a day and revives after work.”</p>
<p>The dude fell quiet, and William did as well.</p>
<p>Then William turned pale, because he lose the sheet of paper that he was writing on, the plans, what if the boss finds it, and it's got the time on it and everything.</p>
<p>“I'd better get going” the dude said, he stood up and left.</p>
<p>“See you man” Greece Marlian waved to him, and they said bye to each other. William was busy going through his pockets for the paper.</p>
<p>“You lose something?” Greece said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, something really important”</p>
<p>“What is it”</p>
<p>“Paper”</p>
<p>“Shit”</p>
<p>William turned up to work early the next day, he swiped the counters for the paper, he looked through the rubbish bins and felt the gazes of everyone on his shoulders. He couldn't find it after an hour of searching.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, his colleague Dadine was supposed to come in. He spoke a European language fluently and was extremely useful for the team in dealing with these European customers. But a lot of the time, instead of selling products, he ended up talking to the customers, asking them where they were from and what they were doing here. Talking about the weather fo their place, he was particularly interested in British people. The customers acknowldeged his efforts and usually responded enthusiastically. They were on holiday and were usually impressed by this man in this foreign country being so kind to them.</p>
<p>But ot his colleagues he was a disaster. He never got his jobs done, he was always running off to the bathroom or to fill his water bottle, he made big mistakes on the counter that other people found at the end of the day and had to stay back and solve until late into the night.</p>
<p>Dadine always came to work on time. That was one of the rules here, you could do anything you wanted at work, but you had to be here on time, if you were late then there would be trouble. The hotel ticked to its own time and all of the bosses and employees ticked to that time as well. No one had their own watch. Even if we could see the mountain outside, or it was obscured by thick cloud, the time was the same.</p>
<p>William stood behind the counter, beat. He had spent the last hour looking everywhere and didn't know where else to look. Now that work had started he would have to stay here instea dof searching some more.</p>
<p>Then he slowly turned his head to look at Dadine. The man was behidn the counter, he greeted William cheerfully and asked about him. He wanted to know more about William's story. “There'snot much to know”</p>
<p>Then, without asking more, Dadine launched into a story of a man he once knew who had tried to kill a different person here. He also knew a man who threatened to kill him for having his music on too loud. He also todl a story of wandering into the mountains and falling asleep at the top of the bare mountain.It was pitch black and he was wandering down, finding his way back. He told these three stories with dexterity, and within the three stories was hidden a trail of his personality. There was a hint of violence, an ignorance, and an appareciation fo nature.</p>
<p>As William gazed at this man, with one hand on the counter, a neat and tidy uniform, and still talking, he wondered how much of Dadine's personality could be accurately represented and inherited by these aspects. </p>
<p>Dadine served a customer who came up. He was doing three things at once, talking to William, counting the money in the cahsier (probably not very accurately), and serving a customer.  Then when William began talking he interrupted him</p>
<p>“Don't talk, not while I'm doing this” he said, “I'm a very rigid man, I can only do one thing at a time” he smiled, the grin pulsing over his lips and manifesting on his eyelids, “But I'll do that thing excellently”</p>
<p>“Tell me another story” William said.</p>
<p>Dadine talked a lot, but he didnt' do his job. William didn't see it, but his colleagues and sueprvisors, Jeena, </p>
<p>What was msot fscinating though, was that despite having the whoel world against him, he didn't seem to realzie it. “They're catty talkers” he once said, when William hinted at others talking behind his back. Then he launched into a story of his own, and started discussing his morals and William's morals. They shared them like it was merchandise.</p>
<p>It was the best conversation William had had all day.</p>
<p>“I hear you're a player” Dadine laughed, “That's fine, but just don't trust these women, they'll do anything. You're youn,g you need to experience these things, Ir ememebr when I was younger I went to a bar and I rpetended to be American, and speak in this American accent, then all the women would come up to me. But then I went up to another women with an Irish accent. Whcih was fine, you know, it was all going good, but then later on in the night the woman I spoke in an American accent with, and the woman I spoke in an Irish accent to, they miraculously came up to me together, and I was confused, what could I possibly do?”</p>
<p>Dadine had a studio in his house, and he wanted to be a full time musician, instead of working in this store. The only problem, he said, was that he needed better equipment.</p>
<p>Apparently he had been saying this for five years, even after he bought new equipment. Elizabeth professed to it one time when they were finishing work.</p>
<p>Dadine talked to everyone and had a library full of stories to share, but he was a pain to work with, he didn't get his jobs done, and only half finished them at the end.  Everyone complained about him behidn his back, but out of work he was the most popular man, and everyone asked about him.
“How's he doing? Is he still working there?”</p>
<p>Then, when William and Dadine went to throw out the rubbish, closing the store for five monutes, Dadine walked ahead, ignoring William. But when they came to the door, he stopped and walked through. </p>
<p>“Oh, sorry” he turned back around, “I forgot to hold it open for you, that's so rude of me, I'm really sorry” He started apologizing profusely over what William saw as such a small deal. But for some reason it had hurt him a lot. He freely ignored others and said that work was pointless, and made others do the work, but when he forgot to hodl the door open he felt a sense of guilt. In his mind, open doors were not a luxury that every human could observe, but they were a right that every human inherited.</p>
<p>The others around him would never understand, and they would be upset or feel weird to hear their friend doing all of this and saying all of this. “It's wrong, it's not good, it's bad” When they heard about Dadine, everyone came to judgments about him easily.</p>
<p>After an hour, when they had returned from the rubbish, Dadine was looking oevr his roster and stressing about the erratic hours he had to work. The erratic hours were the normal hours for everyone else, it was just that he had been privileged to certain hours because he refused to work the ones he didn't like.</p>
<p>Black wlaked into the store, his posture was tall and striaght like usual. He quickly scanned the store to see anything out of place, or aythign that could be inproved. Then he settled on Dadine. Dadine was still looking at the roster innocently.</p>
<p>“Dadine, could I have a word with you at the back?” Both men went to the back, William manned the front for a while, but had to go and retrieve something from the storage out back. He went to open the door, then saw the two men facing each other. Black had a piece of paper in his hand full of scribbles and names underlined. </p>
<p>“I've never seen it before” Dadine said.</p>
<p>William felt a shiver crawl up his back, Black looked at him and nodded respectfully in a way that thanked him for working double the amount. He knew Dadine didn't work hard, or hardly worked.</p>
<p>Black turned back to William, he sighed and asked “Who is this Mr. Angry, it looks like your handwriting, this Mr. Angry looks like a toxic character. Is it made up? </p>
<p>“I told you” Dadine said, “I didn't do it” The way he spoke was so forceful to his boss.  “Why yell at me? It had nothing to do with me!” he said.</p>
<p>William nodded back. “I don't think Dadine would do something like this”</p>
<p>Black pushed William aside and told him to go back to his job, then Black started talking of punishments, the paper had bad things written on it about people, and apparently a few people had professed to the writing belonging to Dadine. Dadine was being punished and he had no idea why he was being punished for someone else's sins.</p>
<p>“I don't know who wrote that, the person who wrote that can't be in the right mindset, but I'm in the right mindset, look at me, I'm fine.” </p>
<p>“Don't lie to me” Black said, ina  tone that made him so scary. Human beings were the scariest thigns in this world. Because they were the most similar to us, with the same needs and desires they were would create some truly dreadful acts.</p>
<p>William only overheard a bit of the conversation, but it was enough to make him guilty. He wished he hadn't walked into the storeroom. He coudlnt' decide whether to profess that he had written it. It had negative things written about the colleagues, things he was watching and doing.</p>
<p>After the two came back, Dadine was quiet, he wasn't his normal self. William tried to talk to him, to resolve his own guilt, if Daine answered normally, it meant that nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Black came back as well, “Busy today?” he said, “It's not busy now, I can see, but in the summer it's going to be busier”</p>
<p>“When is the summer?” William said.</p>
<p>“Whenever there are a lot of customers” Black said. For some reason Black was being really kind to William, it was almost as if he felt bad for saying those things to him yesterday. But even in kindness he was in control and knew what was happening here.</p>
<p>After Black left, William still tried to gauge Dadine's interest. He started talking about world issues with Dadine. But he was unable to gauge much interest out of the man. The man had become silent after the scolding, for something he had never done. William looked at his fingernails, he still had time to go and fix this, to admit he had written it. </p>
<p>But he could see the expression on Mr. Angry's face, after the plan had been shown. It would compromise the safety of everyone in the heist. And it was irresponsible of William to ruin everyone's safety and hard work for something as small as this right?</p>
<p>“Did you hear what happened overseas?</p>
<p>“Sorry” Dadine said, “William, I'm not in the mood to talk, let's just do our work okay?” Dadine said that, and sat down, although work meant doing thigns like cleaning what was already clean, but cleanign it again because there was nothing else to do, or rearranging clothes into something more beautiful and appropriate than what was already beautiful and appropriate.</p>
<p>William was unable to do it, he faced a failure to tell the truth. He was a coward in the face of his boss and his friends. He blamed himself for having this guilt, if he didn't feel guilty and left things like this, then everything would be fine and the heist wouldn't be placed in danger.</p>
<p>What made it worse was that Dadine didn't suspect him at all. And that was so touching, he felt even more guilty. Dadine was such a pure soul that he didnt' question why he was being blamed. He took the blame and now didn't know what to do with it, like a kid been given a million dollars and not knowing what to buy.</p>
<p>William knew that they would have to stop the hesit if they couldn't retrieve the paper. Mr. Black had probably thrown it out.</p>
<p>“CanI tell you a story?” Dadine said.</p>
<p>“I thought you didn't want ot talk” William was surprised by his own tone, it sounded like he was annoyed at Dadine, like Dadine had done something wrong, was he? Annoyed?</p>
<p>“If someone had a really spiky stone...no wait, you know how on TV they have people who have drugs in their bags and they never knew about it? Well they are incriminated for someone else putting drugs into their bag?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, what about them?” William said, </p>
<p>“Do they feel guilty for it? They didn't do it themsleves, but someone else did it”</p>
<p>William knew what Dadine was saying, even better than Dadine himself knew. But for some reason he was upset, “Thigns always happen, you just have to deal with it, if it comes your way, then so what” </p>
<p>William's guilt ahd disapepared, for some reaosn talking to Dadine made him dislike this man.He pictured Mr. Angry smiling, this is what he would have done. Mr. melancholuy would follow in Mr. Angry's footsteps, that was enough for him, that would keep him satisfied.</p>
<p>The paper would possibly incriminate them. But where had Mr. Balck found it&gt; that was also an important part of it.</p>
<p>Dadine nodded, like he was listening intently. “Okay, I guess so”</p>
<p>“But don't listen to me” William said, “It's never happened to me before, and if you're feeling that way, that's why you're asking me this kind of question right? Because of the feeling it gives you, you have to figure out how you feel, how you should feel for yourself”</p>
<p>“Okay, I just have no idea why I'm being punished for something I didn't do.”</p>
<p>“You were punished for something you didn't do?”</p>
<p>Dadine raised his hand, it meant he didn't want to talk anymore. “I'm not going to say anything bad about anyone” he said. “That's my personal belief”</p>
<p>After about six hours, Mr. Black left, and Dadine staretd to open up, he spoke like he had recovered completely. And he started multitasking, talking while dealing with customers. A different colleague came in, today it was all males. This man was serious and meticulous, he organized evyrthing efficiently and tried not ot talk during work. He was one of the boss's favourite employees.</p>
<p>There were no customers in the store right now, and William leaned back to look through some of the reviews that customers had of the hotel.</p>
<p>“Stop doing that” the man said. He didn't even look over William's shoulder, he didn't even know what William was doing.</p>
<p>“No one's watching me anyways right?” There were cameras above them but the boss hardly watched.</p>
<p>“No one's watching” The man said,</p>
<p>“SO I can do what I want?” William said.</p>
<p>“Well, you can do what you want, but you will be treated accordingly...” he said.</p>
<p>“But you just said nobody's watching”</p>
<p>“You know you should do the right thing even if nobody's watching” he paused and reshelved some brochures in adifferent place that would be easier for everyone to access, “The boss is watching”</p>
<p>“But you just said no one was watching”</p>
<p>“Everyone watches the stars at night” he said. “We all watch something”</p>
<p>“No, I meant the Creator, is He watching?”</p>
<p>“Don't ask me that kind of stuff man, that's not cool...I mean how should I know? Go ask someone smart who knows.” He gotten a degree from university, even studied postgraduate, but now he was doing this retail job at a mediocre hotel. He didnt' feel smart.</p>
<p>“Well who knows and is able to provide an answer? The religious men? The university theologian professors? The pregnant mothers with child? The philanthropists? The pious who pray for an end of the war? The terminally ill lying on their deathbed? The busker on the street who sings about everything anyone has told him? The store owner who walks back and forth from the same store everyday repeatedly? The school child who cries after his first encounter with a bully? The Prophets and Foreseers of the world who practice virtues and unbelievable kindness? The Saints? The heinous criminals who commit the worst crimes? The young woman who was raped in an alley on a late night? Every one of these people will give me an answer, and it doesn't even matter if it's the same answer or a different answer.”</p>
<p>He blew up, “Did I ask for your opinion? You don't go around asking that stuff man, it's a burden, you don't go around putting a burden on people, shit. What kind of questions are you even asking people? Learn some manners bro”</p>
<p>After an hour, when the flow of customers died down he spoke out of the blue naturally. He wa susually a quiet man, and thoughtful, he worked out everyday after work. “Look bro, no one knows what they're doing, some people say they do and they try to tell you what to do, but it's your life, no one can live it for you. Everyone's just trying to live their life, no one knows what's around the corner, everyone's struggling to understand their emotions and how it relaets to anything. So don't be so low or so lost, you're the same as everyone else. That's what I do with my life”</p>
<p>He didn't stop there, he kept talking, William stood by listening, it wasn't the advice he was amazed by, it was just by this man expressing himself, he probably felt really vulnerable whiel doing so as well. “It's really good advice, thank you for speaking” William said.</p>
<p>“I said that to someone” he said, “You never knw what's aroudn the corner. She was living a life she was bored of, she said it would be like this, but at the same time sudden changes happen. The next week she was obsessed with this new guy she met, the two were together 24/7. So you never know what's around the corner.”</p>
<p>To William it sounded like a love story, and he had just confessed. William stood like a mouse watching which way to run. He was so touched, this man would never know, but those words were what extremely comforting, and what he needed to hear at this moment.  He wanted to hug him, but knew the man would reject him, because men weren't supposed to hug each other. Were they supposed to hug or not? </p>
<p>Who knew, no one knew. </p>
<p>“Are you okay? Stop standing like that man, it makes me think I said something wrong”</p>
<p>William stopped, “I want to hug you” he walked forward with his arms open, but the man shied away. </p>
<p>“Dude, please. Respect?”</p>
<p>“Sorry” William nodded, it was okay if they didn't hug, he just wasn't sure if a hug was okay or not, he woudln't do it next time.</p>
<p>After work William didn't spend it with a girl, he sat in the common room waiting for Daniel. Daniel appeared and William told him what happened. “I write on notes” he said, “About my thoughts and everything that happens. But I lost the paper at work.” </p>
<p>“So you lost this paper that has my name on it?”</p>
<p>“No, it says Mr. Angry”</p>
<p>Daniel flared up, his nostrils looked like giant machines. “Those names the whole plan, it's a personal investment, our personal investment, just what do you think you're doing? Our real names are on it.”</p>
<p>“But your real name is Daniel”</p>
<p>“These plans” Daniel said, “Everything. I wanted to put it in a museum, then people from all over the world could come and see it, how the biggest heist in history happened, they coudlr ead the plans, see our personal handwriting and codenames, it was all important, and your'e ruining it”</p>
<p>“But I want to help you, I love the plan” William said.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry grunted, he closed his eyes strongly, his fists were clenched and he stood up from the green sofa. His pants were saggy and loose, his hosuekeeping uniform looked dirtier than ever today. “Don't ruin it” he said, “Every again”</p>
<p>He left the room.</p>
<p>Then William felt a despair overcome him. It was a strange despair, moments ago he had been hopeful that Daniel would accept his losses. </p>
<p>But Daniel's way of dealing with relationships and trouble was to not deal with them at all if he coudln't understand them. Daniel had walked away. Black would never have done so, he would have communicated everything until the end.</p>
<p>The next day at work, Black was trying to respect William. He was behind the counter when William walked in, clearly stressed about something. He wished William would be more relaxed, not just because it was better with the customers, but also because it was better with himself as well. He also wanted to respect all of those around him.</p>
<p>When an employee did something that misrepresented the hotel, the guys up top would point fingers at him and ask him why he doesn't have it under control. Why doe she have son many employees working, why are there so many bad comments from customers about the store? The pressure trickled like water running down a black stone brick wall.</p>
<p>He was especially embarrassed when the complaints lodged against him were personal insults, when his employees said the didn't want to work for him. Or when people from other departments came to help. They were doing it because they helped everyone, but he felt like he wanted to manage things himself without need of help from outside.</p>
<p>When employees did or said things., he heard about it, and when they complaiend about him, his colleagues, the heads of the other departments came to him and told him calmly, but inside they were laughing that he couldnt' kepe his children under control. They didn't want to work for him.</p>
<p>The pressure trickeld down from above, and was slowly diffusing as it hit people. And so he didn't want to upset his employees, but he had to be the boss as well and be respected.</p>
<p>And when William came in, he sensed an employee in mental trouble, and he sensed a man he could help.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it was William who came up to him and asked to talk to him. He was an employee who was good on paper, but actually very bad in reality.</p>
<p>“Just as you said” Black started, “I discussed with them, and they said it was just as you said”</p>
<p>Then they sat down in their usual spots. Black was in his chair in front of the computer, William faced him on the stool. He was timid and very shy, like a kitten recovering from an extreme shock. Black wondered if this was his natural state, every time he saw him William was like this. But he heard stories form tohers of William being relaxed and the pleasantest person to be around.</p>
<p>This place in the nature didn't have many people and everyone knew each other, there was a lot of space for face to face interaction, and everyone knew and trusted each other closely. But William seemed to be in a different world. He felt like a parent who needed to intervene in this child's life, he questioned how William's parents had raised him.</p>
<p>“Before you say anything, can you let me tell you a story?”</p>
<p>He started talking, and as he started talking he enjoyed himself and his tone loosened, he wasn't the boss in action, he was a man telling a story as old as time in his own way.</p>
<p>When I was young, a bit older than you, I worked in a beautiful environment, and it was the best place, everyone loved it there. Except, there was only one problem, and it wasn't my problem, it was the problem of someone I knew. She was always telling me about things I did, or the things that I didn't do. But they were all small issues compared to one big issue she had. She said that every night she fell asleep, but she couldn't leave her room, because around four am there was a monster in the corridor. It slowly slivered past. She had never seen it, but that's what she sensed, it slivered, like a snake. She said she imagined it was six feet long, and so fat. It also played music so loud and woke everyone up around the place. No one had seen it, but everyone had heard it, most of the people in the living quarters tlaked of this monster that woke everyone up at four am.”  </p>
<p>“When the monster passed, no one dared to go outside to check it, the sounds were too disgusting. And in the morning when they woke up and checked the carpet outside, there was no sign of anything passing through, the carpet was normal. One lady, Gina, at the time it was a common name, she was a housekeeper, she went out partying and came back at four am, she got a black eye and a string of insults flung at her, she claimed it was from the monster. And that the monster treally existed. It was strange because everyone knew about the monster, but no one had seen it, no one dared venture out of their room at this hour when they heard it coming. Gina was the only witness, and she was scared. People would come out of their room at ten past four and see nothing, five am, three fifty five am, and there was nothing there. But as soon as it hit four am the monster came, promptly. And the hotel time was universal with everyone, same as these days.”</p>
<p>Balck sighed and looked at William, the latetr was listening intently, he loved stories, any form of stories would capture his attention.</p>
<p>“That monster” Black said, “Was me. I realized it and changed myself, over about three years and four tears. I finished work at four am. When I was a monster I stole things from others, and now I've become the opposite, I've learnt my morals and how to better the world. Now I also really hate cheaters, people who steal things from others are the worst kind of scum on earth, lower than the cockroches. Because stealing is something so preventable, it's like being fat is preventable; people are just lazy. But some other things are worth pitying.”</p>
<p>Black clapped a few times to himself and waneted William to clap as well, for finishing the story. “I tell this to people, not because they want to hear it, a lot of kids are like, why are you telling me this, but it's because I think it'd be useful for you to hear something like that, a great change that happens in people.</p>
<p>William saw that the boss was human and also experienced pain. That meant he was the same as everyone else, and he could be trusted, and he had gone through his own things in life as well.</p>
<p>“Mr. Black” William said. It was the first thing he had said since sitting down here. Hgis colleagues walked past behind him, minding store matters, they all left Black alone with whoever he was talking to, they knew it was private.</p>
<p>“It was me who wrote the paper.”</p>
<p>Black blinked, “What paper?”</p>
<p>“The one with all the words on it?”</p>
<p>It took him a while to remmeber, “Oh you mean that paper?” he followed immediately, “What should we do, someone needs to apologize to Dadine then, he got the blame for that.”</p>
<p>“It was wrong of me to falsely accuse him, I was sure it was him” Black staretd thinking, if William had written it, it was unexpected, but it would explain a lot.”</p>
<p>And they discussed it, and Black was so generous about it, in some ways even more generous than Mr. Angry was. And then he felt like maybe Mr. Black was better and more reliable than Mr. Angry. Black kept talking, he was so open and so considerate, he really was trying to find the best solutions for everyone. Sometimes that made him have to hold a conrete face and be hated by his employees, but he saw them all as his children. William could tell.</p>
<p>Then he inevitably began to feel bad about the heist. If Black was so kind, and so accurate, and so trustworthy, didn't that mean the hesit was wrong? The next time he went to see Mr. Angry at  the meeting, he wasn't committed. Mr. Angry noticed it immediately, but in his usual way, didn't say anything, he kept it to himself. William just thought to himself. No communication.</p>
<p>“So why do you say it now, that it was yours, it's all finished, you weren't going to get in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Because” William said, “There are some things that are more important than getting in or out of trouble” </p>
<p>“That's why I hired you” Black said, “You have a bad attitude at work, and are surprisingly lazy, but  when it comes to personal values and moral codes, you are more trustworthy and reliable than anyone else. I think I noticed that when I first talked to you, and talking to you now has brought that feeling back, it's given me a reconfirmation of why I hired you. SO let's sort this out together, then do some good work okay?”</p>
<p>William was happy to resolve issues with Mr. Black, both were respectful about it. But in the end, after everything that was said, William still questioned if what he had was right. Even after everything had finished and the results were announced. There was always the lingering question of rightness this abstract concept that permeated through everything around them. 
Or had he done just what Mr. Black wanted, and what he thought was right as a result? If he stuck with Mr. Angry's views, he would never have this conversation with Mr. Black and become friends with him, and if he stuck with mr. Black's views, he would never tlak to Mr. Angry and think him depsicable. And no one would be happy there.</p>
<p>So how was he supposed to reconcile all of these different beliefs? Where was the textbook to teach him this? How did other people do it? They didn't did they...</p>
<p>Balck watched William, the boy was silent, but his inner mind was working like a high quality car that ran silently. </p>
<p>He wanted to help William, but for some reason at the end fo it all, William didn't accept the help. Even afetr Black told his story. And he sensed William was going down a bad direction on a bad path but he was powerless to stop him or pull him back onto the straight path. Especially not as his boss, he couldn't. But he felt the moral responsibility to do so. This boy had so much potential, but right now he was squandering it. He could potentially become a very big employer, but his heart was not in the work here and he spent his days playing.</p>
<p>“You need to find something you lvoe and stick to that” Black took out the paper and gave it to William. He had stored it in the drawer. “This paper was in the bin” Black said, “Someone had thrown it away, but I thought better and picked it out. It's someone's belongings so I kept it safe. I'm sorry for reading what you wrote, I only thought it was rubbish, and then read on because it was a safety hazard. I hope the things you have written on here will never happen to anyone. Bt ultimately, it's none of my business, it's your choice. Just don't go down this path, you can do some postivie things instead of this stuff here.”</p>
<p>“It's just fiction” William said.</p>
<p>“I hope so, but all fiction is real, if it didn't relate to us we wouldn't read it”</p>
<p>William nodded. Then he got up and went back to work, leaving his heart somewhere else no one could find.</p>
<p>Black nodded behind him, he was proud of this young man and had high hopes for him. As long as he followed some basic rules that Black had learnt from experience of his accumulated years then William would do good.</p>

<h3 id="twenty-five-the-stories-part-1">twenty five: The Stories (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The meeting was to occur at the bar at regular hours. But today was a holiday so there was supposed to be no one here. Mr. Purple walked past the concierge desk, the reception desk, and into the bar, but instead of no one there, it was packed with tourists. They had their cameras and wines out and were discussing photos over drinks. She saw that none of the crew were here, so she took a slightly large table in the corner and silently sipped her glass of clear liquid.</p>
<p>Soon Mr. Lazy entered, he stood at the doorway and looked around, he saw Mr. Purple and a look of recognition sparked on his face. “What's with all these people?” he said, sitting down opposite her.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple had her legs crossed, her long bare legs stood out like meat in a tray of vegetables. Her shoes today were triangles, they were the colour of anger. She shrugged and nodded, then sipped more of her drink. She was always like that, vague, non committing, disinterested, she had no spirit of teamwork, a lone wolf who hunted and ate on her own. She wasn't aware of there being any other wolves around her.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger and Mr. Chatterbox came in together. They didn't see the team members and walked to the other side of the room in a big circle before coming to the table. “What's with all these people?” Mr. Chatterbox said. She sat down with a coffee. Mr. Danger also had a coffee, they had ordered together. “Does Mr. Angry know about this?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple tipped her leg and shrugged again. That was the only action she was going to commit to today.</p>
<p>“He's an idiot” Mr. Danger said. Mr. Lazy nodded in agreement, he was looking around at the others, looking for someone to copy and agree with. “Do you think we can still have this meeting?”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Mr. Angry?” Mr. chatterbox said, “That's what he calls himself right? I mean what kind of person doesn't even tell others their real name. What's up with that? And he's so arrogant.” He doesn't tell us his real name, you know that his name Mr. Angry is an alias.”</p>
<p>“What, really? Why would he do that?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don't know why he would be doing that, but it's almost like he's preparing to be caught or something, I don't know, it's all a bit weird. I don't know if I can trust him. That's why he doesn't tell us his real name.”Mr. Chatterbox had all sorts of theories as to why Mr. Angry was the bad guy, this was just scraping the surface, the lower the went the more burnt it was.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry showed up next, and close behind him was Mr. Melancholy. “Those two are always together, I don't trust them” Mr. Danger said. And Mr. Lazy nodded in agreement. Mr. Purple sat in the corner quiet as usual, her eyes were half closed, like she was ruminating on a deep ancient Plato script. </p>
<p>“Hi guys” Mr. Melancholy sat down, he seemed eager to see them. Recently he was becoming very involved in the missions, and Mr. Purple was frankly disgusted by his enthusiasm. Passion was for ignorant wusses who had never been taken down a few notches.</p>
<p>“Well we can't talk about it can we?” Mr. Angry's first words sparked anger and dissension. It was his fault they coudln't do anything.</p>
<p>“We can move somewhere else?” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“No, it's too suspicious if we all move at the same time together” Mr. Angry said. </p>
<p>“We don't have to move together, we can follow each other at intervals. Whoever's watchign us on the cameras will have too much to look at.”</p>
<p>“Let's do some bonding today” Mr. Angry said. “Let's share some of our private stories about romance.” Mr. Angry forced a smile, but everyone could see it was fake. (Spock “I believe the correct response is 'you're welcome')
Artemis Fowl, butler says “You want em to dirnk this don't you?”</p>
<p>“Oh here we go” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“I believe the correct response is 'yes' ” Mr. Angry said</p>
<p>“Uh...why?” Mr. Chatterbox said. “They're private for a reason?”</p>
<p>“This is what we're doing now” Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>This was scary, privacy was what kept everyone alive, sharing privacy it meant they would have nothing to keep them alive, because it was all known, especially for criminals.</p>
<p>“We'll talk about romance” was Mr. Angry's great idea. “People keep coming in and walking past, we can't talk business here, so let's make it a little different and enjoy our time here, bonding together will alleviate a lot of stress and help us rely on each other. Statistically, the chances of success will close to double.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry's statistics were so concise that they sounded like they had been fished out of someone's ass. He played a pipe of beauty, and everyone who listened to him agreed that his pipe was difficult to play, but he was very good at it, and the sounds he created moved and made everyone dance to his rhythm.</p>
<p>“I'm done” Mr. Purple stood up, she left her wine glass half empty, the liquid sloshing back and forth like a stormy sea inside the cup, and she uncrossed her legs and stood up. She dusted off her pencil skirt, the same one she always wore and turned to walk away. </p>
<p>“Why are you leaving?” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“This is a waste of time” she was almost at the door. “If it's not business then I'm wasting time”</p>
<p>“There's business in talking” Mr. Angry said. </p>
<p>Mr. Purple stood with her back facing everyone, she was midstep, and no one could see it, but her head was exploding with decisions and choices to make. Then finally she made her decision and went to the counter.</p>
<p>When she sat back down she had a bottle of wine.  “This is the only way I can tell you guys anything” she said, “We're going to share our lives right? Well then let's share”</p>
<p>Now the party had started. With Mr. Purple involved it was going to be really fun.</p>
<p>Besides all the guys wanted to know more about the enigmatic Mr. Purple.</p>
<p>“So here's how it's going to work” Mr. Angry said, “We go in a circle, each person tells a story and it moves to the next person, the story has to be interesting, otherwise you have to tell a different one. We repeat this twice and go around.</p>
<p>“And how long is this going to take?” Mr. Chatterbox looked at her clock.</p>
<p>“As long as it will” Mr. Angry looked around the room, “Since it's my idea, I'll start the ball rolling by going first.” He looked around again at everyone's faces before starting. He knew that he had to reveal something worthwhile if he was to gain the trust of these people.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was aware of Mr. Angry's pathological lying, he was like the media, which said whatever it pleased to create sensations and emotions in an audience. But Mr. Angry was so good at it that even after knowing that, Mr. Melancholy still wanted to hear it.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry's First Story</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was negative as usual, he tipped his drink into his mouth and sat with his elbows on his knees. “The guys called 'Marriage', there's five or six of them, sometimes you see them walking down the street. It's a rare occasion, but they live in my neighbourhood, and when I see them I try to observe them. But basically they all look the same, they all have the bald shaven head and look tired. They walk in a line of about five guys, and they hunt down single men with sweet words. I've been approached a few times by them, but I knew what they were up to. Like I said, my neighbourhood is full of these guys. But there's one guy in particular, he's their ringleader, they all call him their boss, so that's gotta mean something. Don't ever associate with him, you should run as soon as you see him. He has hired many angels to work for him. His name is marriage and he doesn't have a last name, he made a business out of this word.”</p>
<p>“A few centuries ago Marriage hired a frontman, she's got a beautiful angelic face that smiles and laughs and is eager for more. She listens to everything you say, and is respectful of your space and territory. She makes promise that are full of the most beautiful things in a human's experience. But behind her is a lot of things. And you start to realize that it's a loose advertisement that is full of emptiness and masterfully crafted lies.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry dived into personal details of his life, “One time, one of these frontmen came up to me, we got along, and she never mentioned her employer, Marriage. It was a medium rare night, and she was looking me in the eyes, standing so close to me like a mirror, with such a beautiful smile. She was wanting me to ask her to marry her, then she would finally get a reward from her boss. She acted like she didn't mind, but it was the only thing on her mind. I knew this, and her friends probably knew all about it as well. </p>
<p>But then, in the end nothing came of it and I threw her away.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry finished his drink and clashed it on the glass table. “I'm done”</p>
<p>Not because anyone had to, but they clapped because they felt like it. It was a quiet heartwrming sound of five people clapping for a story Mr. Angry had. </p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked to his left, at Mr. Lazy. “You're next”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy grinned, he hid a smile, he realized he atcually wanted to share this story with someone. And for once there was some people who were wanting to listen. He didn't have to scream and feel like he wasn't being heard.</p>
<p>“I don't know if I can top that story. Mine is just something really simple and plain” Mr. Lazy said. “It's a bit of my life, and it shows a romance that's so beautiful that it's dangerous.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy's First Story</p>
<p>(Story about marriage, contrasting it with Mr. Angry's.)
“I made it a habit when I was in the city to talk to people in cafe's. If I had some spare time on a weekend, or it was a godo temperature outside, or it hadn't rained in a while, or if I woke up an hour early, I would leave my apartment and go to the cafe with a friend. Usually it was one of the quiet ones nearby, and this friend and I would discuss anything. I would usually end up talking about my worries, the things that were happenign in my life, and wanted another opinion on them. Cafe's are places for that, it just comes naturally, they stimulate that sort of conversation. And usually invitied anyone along.</p>
<p>But one time I was sitting in the cafe, and a woman was sitting there...”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy was interrutped by his listeners going “Ooohh” </p>
<p>“Yeah, finally the woman enters the picture, it really is romance. But I went up to her because I was curious about her, she was drinking something I would never drink, and she didn't look up once. We started talking, and she was very friendly, everything went smoothly, there was no trouble.But what was really amazing was that she connected with me about everything, and instead of having a ten minute chat and exchanging numbers, we had a ten hour chat. Literally, we sat there and talked until the cafe closed, and then we changed location to somewhere else that was open until later, and stalked there until that cafe closed as well. It was 2am and the only places open were nightclubs. She asked me if I wanted to go to one. I said yes, and two horus later I could not get this girl out of my mind for one second, everything she was wearing, everythign she looked at, I tried to anticipate her needs. Then, I took her to a restauratn open at night, and I crouched on the floor like a Japanese Samurai, because I didn't have a ring with me, I had no time to prepare.”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh” Mr. Chatterbox was fluttering her hand like a fan, “No Way!”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy nodded, “Exactly, it was totally crazy, I proposed to her, with no ring, and no preparation, just instantly, on the day I met her, after talking with her. But at the time the feelings were overwhelming, they were beyond my control. It was like we were both enchanted at that moment and nothing we could have done would have sobered us out of it.”</p>
<p>He paused and took a deep breath, “She said 'yes', which was even crazier. Why would she agree to marry this man she had only just met? But she did, and the rest his history, she's my wonderful wife now. We've been together all this time. But there's trouble. Because our married life is difficult, it's like we're two strangers who have no connection to each other, because that is essentially the case. We dont' have anything to talk about, our views on everythign clash, so we just sit there and gape at the TV, the moment one of us opens our mouth it becomes an argument. We both want out, but her parents are super conservative and dont' agree on divorce, and my parents as well, they paid for our wedding, and they would be exrtremely disappointed, besides, they told me she wasn't right for me when we got married, they would only be disappointed to know we weren't doing well.”</p>
<p>“She said she knew she wanted to get married to me the moment she met me. So in that case she was always considering it beforehand. And when we're otgether she's not being herself, she's trying to be a woman who she thinks is the ideal, “Do you want me to act like this, or act like that, which do you like better?” she says a lot. She's very considerate, and listens to me, but she's listening because she knows I need to be listened to. Basically, our relationship is so lacking and bare that we have to make up for normal things with logic and forced actions, and we're both good at that, we can force ourselves to do things, and be relatively happy with it.</p>
<p>“When we go out to do things she's always...”  he changed tactic “What's worse.” he said, “She never told me, she said because she never expected to get married so suddenly, but even if I had waited she woudln't know. But she said she had been sleeping with guys every single night, and she had fallen in love with each of them. So one night she came crying to me and told me all of this, and of course I was shocked, but happy that she told me. But then it hit me, what if she had other things she did, but hasn't told me, worse things that would instantly wreck the relationship?”</p>
<p>“One evening she had her hair tied up real tidy so her neck was bare, that's all I remember, and we were sitting at the cafe, and she told me she had kids, and that she'd already been married before.”</p>
<p>“What?” Mr. Chatterbox said, “She never told you that?”</p>
<p>“She started crying and worrying that she never dared tell me and she felt guilty about it”</p>
<p>“She should feel guilty about it, look what she did to you life” Mr. Chatterbox said. </p>
<p>“Just listen to his story, it's his story and it's the past” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“I'm almost finsihed, it's just that at the time we felt like we were fated” Mr. Lazy said, “And we were fated, we had no say in it. We are committed to each other, but we dont' trust each other wholly, and we rushed into it. But even when It hink back to it now, that moment, that night when I met her for the first time and the emotions flowed like a pipe overflowing with the wrong liquid and completely blasted all over everything. That night, in a graph, was the climax of my life, after that everything is kind of sinking down.I am able to be with the woman of my dreams together forever. But it's nothing like your expectations, reality is a bitch, for both of us. We are fated and strung together, and no matter what happens we are together, no matter if we love each other beyond the world, or if we hate each other until we can't even be in the same room. The amount of trust between us is insurmountable by mere worldy troubles, but we sometimes feel like we no longer even live in this world.” </p>
<p>There were no claps, it was such a shocking revelation. </p>
<p>“That's why I want to do this heist” Mr. Lazy said, “taht's why I was excited about it, it gives me another chance at life, a thrill that reinvigorates, it's like an injection that will keep me going, a vaccination from the dullness of the world.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy read everyone's reactions and slumped down, “I'm sorry, I just wanted to share my life that's all”</p>
<p>“No, there's no need to say sorry, thank you for sharing something so personal with us” Mr. Angry said, “It's a great learning for the young ones here who are still walking along the path themselves.” </p>
<p>Mr. Danger leaned forward, he took a big swallow of water, “I guess it's my turn now”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger's First Story</p>
<p>His voice was low and monotonous, he spoke so quietly and slowly. It was a reserved side to his character that they hadn't seen in the meetings. </p>
<p>“I was raised a religiously” he said, “So religiously that the whoel world seemed unimportant and a waste of space. There were ways to live my life, like what to do and not to do. I wasn't allowed to hurt anyone's feelings, I wasn't allowed to swear, I wasn't allowed to leave the dinner unfinished, and I wasn't allowed to have a girlfriend, or a boyfriend. Over time I started to develop anxiety, a deep anxiety that was like a violin that never stopped playing, the string were always vibrating uncomfortably, even while asleep. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart pounding and sweat gripping the corners of my body. The clock showed the hours of the early morning and I had to go to school the next day. So my solution was to pray to God, the more anxiety I felt the more I would pray to Him, because anxiety meant I was impure and needed to trust in God. I believe in God the most when I was feeling vulnerable or happy, but in the day to day I was just a normal guy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy watched as Mr. Danger spoke and thought only about how Mr. danger had done such a violent deed, he tried to reconcile the Mr. danger who was speaking now, with the Mr. Danger who had done horrific deeds in the past.</p>
<p>“And because of my anxiety, it developed in me a neediness, to constantly be with someone, I was with girls, but they weren't interesting, they were fun to talk to, but under their clothes they were boring. Then I found men, they were fun to talk to, and more. But my parents found out about it and made me step back. “Step Back” my Mum said, “Step Back” like she was reciting a ritual of ancient magic. Whenever I saw men, I would exhale and breathe deeply, then slowly calm myself down and resist the temptations. I would feel really guilty for being interested in men...”</p>
<p>The story kind of just stopped there, Mr. Danger wiped his brow, he was sweating. “That was really difficult for me to say”</p>
<p>“Good job” Mr. Chatterbox smield and leaned oevr to pat him on the back, she was really encouraging towards everyone. Her attitude had changed to something a lot more hospitable. She was starting to enjoy this a lot more than she expected and was even looking forward to her turn.</p>
<p>“You're next Mr. Melancholy” She sat with her hands between her legs, squeezing them in anticipation. Her boyfriend was about to speak about romance, how could she not be excited? Just her boyfriend speaking was already exciting.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy's First Story</p>
<p>“I don't know if this is a story” he said, “It's more like just thoughts that I have, is that okay?”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry nodded slowly, his gaze was warm and encouraging.</p>
<p>“I feel like my life is going normally, there's no railway tracks, nothing to disrupt anything, nothing to change anything, and then suddenly the train hits a brick wall. It's romance, or a girl or a woman or whatever. And then I feel like life is so complicated and I keep criticizing myself for being so complicated, stop being so complicated. Why can't I settle down and relax about things? I start becoming anxious about everything, anxiety always comes upon me like a monster lurking in the shadows.”</p>
<p>He could see the members losing attention, Mr. Lazy was looking away, Mr. Angry was swallowing his drink. Only Mr. Chatterbox had both palms under her chin and was hearing every word he spoke. </p>
<p>“I'm going to stop, sorry I don't have a story”</p>
<p>“No, don't!” Mr. Chatterbox said, “Keep talking, go on”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry nodded encouragingly, and Mr. Melancholy continued. “Well everyone's making their artistic, so I'll try to do the same.” He crossed his legs, “It's like I'm walking through a long path with everyone watching me, someone sees my hand and likes it and follows me because of it. Someone else sees my leg hair, one specific one, and they follow it because they like it. Then someone else sees my nose and follows that. And in the end I'm being followed by one hundred different people who all like some part of me. But which of them likes me?” </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy looked up, “Is that story alright?”</p>
<p>“Go on” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“Fine, then when I walk further, the people following me have their houses, and they invite me in, the first person only sees my hand and invites my hand in, and then she notices there's more than a hand, and is handicapped by action. She's surprised. Everyone's like that, they only saw part of me, and when I get close they shy away. Another girl sees that I speak Chinese and Arabic, and then she is attracted, but then she sees me arrive at her door, and I can see it in her eyes before she has thought about saying it, it's a look I've seen so many times, I dred it every time I meet someone new, because they always give me the look, and it means everything has finished  between us before it has even started. SO it's like a swimming pool that everyone comes and dips their toes into, then they decide it's too cold and leave. It's like I have no substance beyond what is on the surface. Maybe I'm just a superficial person.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was afraid that saying this would drive Mr. Chatterbox away, he kept looking at her. Despite having so many girls in his life, he didn't want to lose any, because they all had a part of him within them. </p>
<p>He looked around, they realized he finished and started clapping. He had just confessed his self, but for some reason he felt like no one listened. </p>
<p>“I'm curious” Mr. Lazy said, “You speak Chinese and Arabic? Isn't that really useful today? Is that why you were hired for the job?”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy felt a sharp pain, because cared more about his language skills than who he was, about the personal story he just shared and identified with. Didn't they care about it at all?</p>
<p>“I would give you my language skills” he said, “If you would give me your attention”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, we were all listening, you had our attention, even though it was a boring story.”</p>
<p>Were they here to listen to stories? Or for something else? Or was William's story just too boring to enjoy because he had no talent in storytelling?</p>
<p>None of them knew or realized that he just spoke his heart out, now it was officially in the open after being concealed and locked up for so long in the dark ages of his memories and feelings. But now that they were in the open, the open was empty. </p>
<p>Should he repeat himself to get an answer? Or should he pretend like he never said it and hope everyone ignored it and didn't ask questions?</p>
<p>Then he looked around and wondered how many of these others also spoke their heart and it never went anywhere? Was that why everyone made up stories?</p>
<p>Then they all heard sniffling. They all turned their heards to see Mr. Chatterbox crying. Her face was dug into her arms and her knees were pressed against her forehead. She couldn't encourage him to go on.</p>
<p>“What was so sad about that?” Mr. Danger said. </p>
<p>“Even Mr. Melancholy's not crying what are you crying for?”</p>
<p>“That's why I'm crying” she said.</p>
<p>“You're so lucky Mr. Melancholy, you have a beautiful woman like Mr. Chatterbox to cry for you” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>It was ironic that the popular Mr. Melancholy had a story about isolation and loss. Mr. Angry never expected it, but he saw greater depths to Mr. Melancholy's personality than he had first seen. </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy had so much of the world, but it was not enough for him.</p>
<p>“I can't explain why I'm crying” Mr. Chatterbox wiped the corner of her eyes with a tissue that was handed to her. She wiped the other eye as well and dropped the tissue on the couch. It was hardly damp.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry” she said “That story just made me really sad” She was embarrassed to show William her crying face, she wanted to show him her upbeat side, it wasn't fair on him to show him her weakness. But he saw it, and he reacted, and she didn't know how he reacted, whetehr it was good or bad. </p>
<p>But she also felt sorry for William. Because what he said about feeling left out, even without him saying it she had always sensed it in him, but she had hoped he didn't realize it himself, and it was just her feeling this way. But when he confirmed her fears, she started to feel hopeless for him.</p>
<p>There was no way she could ever say that to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox's First Story</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox didn't want to say anything when it was her turn, but she relented a story. It was surprsingly long and dear to her, she was quiet about it, religious ideas, and how she was torn between all sides.</p>
<p>“Hey Annalise” someone from outside said,</p>
<p>“Don't call her Annalise, she's Mr. Chatterbox” Mr. Melancholy glared around at the girl, “We have to remain professional at all times” He looked to Mr. Angry for support, he wanted to gain Mr. Angry's trust and respect. But Mr. Angry wasn't even looking at him, he was checking out some slim woman who had just walked in. That was more important to him than respect.</p>
<p>Charlotte was on the other side of the bar and saw all of these people gathered together, she wondered how they all knew each other, and if she could join in for a chat. William was there, and the girl he was friendly with, Annalise, was there as well. Daniel was also there and he was three letters H. O. T.</p>
<p>They were in deep discussion about something, all listening in on each other speaking, she caught a few words here and there. And they wondered who it was.</p>
<p>“I'm in a room” Mr. Chatterbox said. “It's a masked ball, but only one man is wearing a mask. The mask has no expression, it's hard to describe, like it's welcoming but inhospitable at the same time. The masked man ignores all of the other dancers male and female, and has his eyes on me. His pupils are unmoving, like they have been painted into the mask. They are my favourite colour, hazelnut. He is going to seduce me, I can feel it in the air, he doesn't speak a word, he has no voice, his dancing says everything. He has such smooth moves that make my heart beat. And the longer I dance with him the more I am intrigued who is behind this mask.” </p>
<p>“Then I look around and no one is having as much tension as us, others are laughing or joking, being friends, but we are something beyond that. And a part of me is afraid, I want to run away into the embrace of the people around me who are friendly and normal, they won't be threatening and will dance well. But all the while the masked man is in front of me. I have no idea of what he's thinking, I try looking away but I can't, so then I decide that the only way I can solve this is to peel his mask off like an orange. While we're dancing in the middle of everyone, twirling and spiralling like a Pachinko ball, I keep reaching out and trying to peel his mask off. I'm in a trance as well, the modo of the place has changed me. He puts my hand back, but I keep reaching out and trying to peel it off, see what is beneath the mask. I'm hopeful it's someone I can spend the rest of my life with. But I'm also afraid that it might not be what I expect, because my expectations are narrower than the narrowest street in Auckland. Each time though, he holds my fingers delicately like they're chopsticks and says 'no' shaking his finger.”</p>
<p>“So then I'm desperate, the room has changed colour, there are even more people and the music is louder, everyone around us has been changing partners this whole time, they are all living their own lives. But the masked man and I, we haven't changed, we've been staring at each other. Our bodies too hot for dancing and too cold to admit our feelings for each other. I have to start every action with him, so in the middle of everything, I lean over and kiss him over his mask. I feel the cold plastic against my lips, unmoving, I see his unmoving pupils, and he freezes up. For a moment I wonder if he's still alive, or if I'm humiliating myself and kissing a stone.”</p>
<p>“Then he gently pushes me back. So gently that I feel like a leaf falling off a tree branch that it has been connected to for the whole of its life. He made me close my eyes, then he took the mask off. Then he leaned over and kissed me. And I felt warm lips, so smooth and kind and wonderful, like unicorns must feel when they're prancing over the rainbow.”</p>
<p>“But when I open my eyes, I see a horrible ugly old man with wrinkles everywhere. His eyes are like a chameleon, still unmoving, and his tongue is slimy. There are huge spots on his face like the craters on mars, and the wrinkles are like death valley. His skin is oily and I can see the surface boiling. He has huge moles, some are hairy like cells that are alive, some are blotches of skin, if you look closely, as I was, you can see each one has small eyes and teeth and a voice of its own.” </p>
<p>“The mask is around his neck, I throw him off me and run away. I run far away from the party and the lights. The music can be heard a hundred miles away, so I run two hundred miles away. But it was too late, we had already slept together”</p>
<p>“That escalated fast...” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“It was too late, his snakes were writhing in my belly. They were eating me up from inside, and eventually I would give birth to an egg that was full of snakes.”</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>“That's it” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“What was it about, it was so abstract” Mr. Danger said. </p>
<p>“I was raised religiously as well, and I think the solution is there”Mr. Chatterbox said, “One day I want to make it into a book, haha, maybe” she laughed, but everyone encouraged her. “It was about looseness of morals, everyone sleeping with each other, then sometimes all sorts fo problems arise which woudlnt' happen if we were all more conservative and respectful of rules which are the foundation of human society and peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was amazed by his girlfriend's insights, she was so creative, he didnt' know that at all, and suddenly he was really attracted to her, he wanted to know all about her.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was so touched by her story, he sat staring into space, unable to move. It was a state of shock at the reality she had cerated. His mind was going crazy with familiarity and possibility. </p>
<p>But Mr. Purple heard it and was disgusted, why would she ever think that? Why did Mr. Chatterbox tell that disgusting story, who would ever want to listen to something like that? She had thought Mr. Chatterbox was a calm and quiet woman with no such dirty intentions.</p>
<p>“It's a story” Mr. Chatterbox said, “Stop insulting me, we're supposed to tell interesting stories, so that's what I'm doing!”</p>
<p>“Okay it's my turn” Mr. Purple uncrossed her legs for the second time. She sat straight and still for a long time</p>
<p>Mr. Purple's First Story</p>
<p>Mr. Purple started talking and didn't stop. It was organized as if on cue for a long time coming.</p>
<p>“This is my story about a woman who lives in a big land with her brother. Okay? It's quite long, but please listen carefully.” </p>
<p>“They're both happily working everyday and being productive with their lives, their lives are the best lives they can have, except for one problem. They realize they both need to find a partner. Because life isn't meant to be lived alone.” </p>
<p>Mr. Purple took a sip of her next drink that had just arrived. She didn't thank the waiter, she didn't even look down at the drink, she just continued speaking.</p>
<p>“So they decide to set out around the world in opposite directions. She goes due East and he goes due West before leaving they both agree that if they have not met anyone after going once around the world and coming back here, they will not search anymore. She packs her bags, she carries all she needs to find a mate. And he does the same. Now we follow her story.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple took another sip, it was distracting from the vision of this world she had created to see her sipping. “The woman travelled for a while and got to one fo the neighbouring countries across a wide  and calm sea. There, she met a man who fell in love with her frugality. He was the owner of that country, and promised her all the money and fortune he could find. She was delighted and stayed with him. She lived everyday with no shortage of luxuries, she could buy anything she wanted, she could have as many houses and any food she wanted. But after a while she started to grow tired of these things. She felt a boredom overcome her, it grew larger and larger until it was the first thing she thought of in the morning and the last thing she thought of before going to sleep. Her bed was as big as an elephant and as soft as a generous heart, but it wasn't enough. So one day she took her bag, it had been stored away untouched the whole time in one of the closets in the big house. It had become dusty, but she dusted it off, the belongings inside had turned brown and older, she wrote a letter thanking the man for all of his kindness, and moved on out of the country.”</p>
<p>“I think I know where this is going” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple smiled slightly, she took another sip of the drink, eyeing the fire that was burning, and the chandelier above them, before settling on a position to go on.</p>
<p>“The woman went further west, she travelled over freezing seas with only the company of the birds in the sky. Then she finally arrived at a big mountain. Everyone here was poor and without money, she immediately felt welcomed by their hospitality. Usually travellers didn't stop at their island. A volcano erupted every ten years, so they built their houses in the sea, the land itself was only used for hunting and farming. She joined in with them, they asked her about her culture at home and she told them how she lived, a normal life with no changes and no struggles. Then theya sked her why she left, and she said because she needed to find a husband.
The villagers were overjoyed, and they brought out the best man on the island. They said she could marry him. She started to spend more time with him, they had a lot in common, they talked about the volcano, and they talked about social life on the island, and about farming, and he taught her all about living a sustainable lifestyle by reusing everything and living in harmony with nature. In the afternoon she accompanied him to go to the sea shore on the other side of the island and they meditated. He asked her to marry him and she agreed. Everyday he farmed and meditated and came back, she was overjoyed to see him, after a while she bore his children and named them in the traditions of the island. She looked back over the ocean to the east and her old life seemed far away now. She was settled here, this was her home. Then one night her husband came home and he had a handful of new vegetables, her children ran over and peeled them, and she heated them in the hot water and made dinner. But for the first time, she had not been excited to see him. The feeling had died off. She hoped it was just today, and tomorrow her excitement and joy would return. But it didn't, it slowly died away and got worse, her interest wavered and she soon stopped doing the hosuework. Her husband came home one day and saw the chidlren running around like barbarians, the house had not been cleaned and the dinner was not prepared. Before spring arrived, she took her bag from beneath the house where it had been stored. She prepared a letter, the same letter she had prepared so long ago to the previous man she had been with, and put it on their bed. She kissed her children, and she picked up her bag and left.”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger grinned, “I knew it would be this kind of sad story”</p>
<p>“Is it sad? It's amazing” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I'm really loving it”</p>
<p>“I don't mean sad as in that way”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple just shrugged, she took another sip and carried on.</p>
<p>“The items in the woman's bag had turned even browner from age, she looked over her skin to see wrinkles had started to develop, and her walking had become a bit slower. But this didn't worry her. She travelled West again, this time she skipped many shores and finally arrived at a big town with castle in the middle. The castle was famous among the lands. The Prince of the castle needed to be married, but there were no suitable princesses nearby and no political conflicts to seal. So the King had offered a proposal to have women visit the palace, and if they could meet the Prince's demands, they would marry him. Women from all over the town flocked to become the Prince's wife, but none of them could meet his demands. Then our woman, she carried only her bag and stood in line to meet the Prince. Hens he walked through the doors to his palace she was disgusted, the prince wasn't a handsome knight in shining armour. He was a coward who wore gloves because he was afraid of getting germs from others, and he wore a crown that was too heavy for his head. She immediately turned away, dissatisfied. But the Prince was intrigued. He called her over and asked her what was in the bag. She told him tnhat it was just materials that she travelled with. The Prince then and there asked her if she would marry him. She declined, she wasn't interested in spending her life with this prince. What do you want? The prince asked, anything you want you can have it. I am the Prince of this land, everyone listens to what I say. She thought about it and told him that she didn't know what she wanted. The prince became more and more amused with this woman, he offered her the most beautiful dresses in the world, and she would be treated like a princess. So the woman relented and stayed with him. He came oevr to her room every night but she kept it locked, pretending to be asleep. The prince was ridiculed for being unable to consummate his marriage. Then he called her old, and that she needed to bear him his children. And finally, he asked the worst things he could ask her at that time, and each time she heard it she flinched. Because this wasn't the first time she had been asked this, she had also been asked this by the other men she had been with. 'What is it that you want?' What did she want, she didn't know. But she knew what they were going to say and she didnt' know the answer, and was reminded of it every time she acted out. The men always asked her in the end. And the Prince said, Your purposelessness is betrayed by every action you attempt to commit to, there is the smell of a lack of commitment in everything that you do. She left the next morning to travel further West.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple grinned, she was making good progress, everyone was listening “She travelled further west and met a man who engaged her mind so much, she was mentally stimulated by his ideas and ambition, but after a while she grew bored and moved further west, then she met a man who would do all of the housework and invented new products, an interesting combination. She stayed with him and laughed with him, but afetr a while she grew bored again and moved further west. Then she found a man who had what she was looking for, a relaxed attitude to life, he made her laugh all the time, non-stop, the cafes and restaurants they visisted were humoured by her laughter. He said she was perfect for him, she found him funny, and they both helped each other relax. And she agreed, they grew really close, but once again, after a while she grew bored of him as well. And when she left him, he asked the same question as every single other man had ever done before her, 'What is it that you want? What are you searching for' He wanted to be the man she was looking for, he swore that he could do it.”</p>
<p>“So what happens next?” Mr. Melancholy said. “I bet she never finds the man and commits suicide, that's like one of the stories I know”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple grinend and shrugged and took another sip of her drink.</p>
<p>“She travelled further West still, now the weatehr was always colder, and she had grown much older, her fingers had wrinkels on them and her eyes coudlnt' see as well. She didnt' catch as many glances from men as before, and she had to sit down to rest more often. She found herself going through her memories and pained by them more regularly, her mind was telling her that her present life had nothing going for her. She was tired of travelling and wanted to settle down, but the dissatisfaction and boredom always caught up to her. She kept travelling further and further each time, hoping that if she went further it would take longer for the boredom to catch up to her. She felt like she had been born as two people, herself, and the boredom, and they couldn't live without each other.”</p>
<p>“And one day she came upon a calm country, the people were simple and respectful, and she sat at the fountain in the middle of the town and peacefully admired the water flowing. Here she dind't look like a traveller, but one of the locals. Soon a man saw her sitting there and asked her where she was from. They got talking and laughed with each other. She learned that he was rich, respectful and kind, a very moral person who would never dishonor anyone, and would be a great family man, he was honest and sincere, and she could trust everything he said with no doubts. The relief of finding someone as trustworthy as him was overwhelming. He kept proving himself to her in ways which went beyond her expectations of any man she had ever met, and she felt herself rekindling that feeling of excitement and curiosity that she used to feel so long ago. This man did charity work, and he held high opinions and optimisms of human society. He said he was disgusted with how men all only look at women and not really know them. They see legs and hair like an animal does, and not a human soul. And this touched her. And he took her out to see the night sky, the stars were spread out like sesame bread in the sky. And this touched her. And he pointed to the people walking around outside and displayed a hope for humanity, and this touched her as well. She liked what she saw, so if he wanted to stay with her, she would stay with him as well. Everything he said clicked with her own ideology of how she thought about things, and she knew he was the right man. And when she said something back to him, it clicked with him as well, and he also knew she was the right woman. And in all the time they were together, he never asked her the question, of 'What is it that you want?' And she could be with him free of any anxiety.”</p>
<p>“Is he the one?” Mr. Melancholy asked.</p>
<p>“Shut up, let her go on” Mr. Danger and Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple shrugged and sipped more of her drink, </p>
<p>“So they decided to get married and have children. The wedding went smoothly and all of their friends congratulated them, they thought it was the best match they ever saw, even the matchmaker was touched by how perfect they were, and she had set up half of the country. But on their first night together, they were naked and in bed with the covers over them and clothes thrown around the room in the heat of the moment, they both hesitated. “I have something to tell you” she said, and he was surprised, because he also had something to tell her, “I think it is final with you, and I promised to tell someone that I found someone when I did” And he surprisingly said the same thing. And then it clicked, they both knew who each other was, and that they had come halfway around the world.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple made a comma there, but the comma turned into a full stop.</p>
<p>“And...that's it” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>“So what happened, does she marry her brother?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” Mr. Purple shrugged, “You decide”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was still living in the world of the story and felt like tearing up when the spell had broken. And then while everyone was talking about the story he felt like he understood what she meant, that people don't change, and everyone is set in their ways, and on long journeys. He didn't know why, but he really clicked with her version of this story.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple sat there so innocently and aloof to the world, so cold, but she was unbelievably the most warm about it.</p>
<p>“Mr. Purple” he interrupted all of the conversation, he had to ask her.</p>
<p>She sipped more of her drink. Mr. Melancholy told her his speculations. “I thought that was genius, it hit me really hard”</p>
<p>She shrugged, “I don't know, I deny your allegations, I don't know what it means, I just said it because I felt like it. I'm a plain woman with plain troubles”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy shook his head, his fascination with her was growing, she had no idea of how amazing she was. “You can only be plain if you're living in this world, in this environment, you can't be anything else”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox saw this exchange; everyone did, but Mr. Chatterbox saw it, she saw her boyfriend hitting on the hot woman sitting beside her, she saw an infatuation in him that she had never seen him possess over her. She coudln't believe how unreliable men were, she had forgotten about the story, she was thinking about her real life now. But to the others she was in her own world andbeing forgotten. She cared about William, he didn't care about her, but right now he cared about Mr. Purple. She knew that, any girl could see that, but not every girl could admit it. And she wasn't the type to be able to.</p>
<p>But Mr. Purple wasn't interested in Mr. Melancholy, she kept looking at Mr. Chatterbox with care. It was a love triangle so common in the drama's. If any of the points in the middle could be eliminated it would be so much easier...but the feelings never received the memo. They lived in their own world as well.</p>
<p>The conversation died down, and with it Mr. Angry's turn had returned.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-six-the-stories-part-2">twenty six: The Stories (Part 2)</h3>
<p>“Firstly” he said, “I would like to compliment the diversity and the creativity of these stories, they have gone 'far beyond my expectations' as Mr. Purple would say. It's really great to hear everyone's contributions. ”</p>
<p>She just nodded and took another sip of the never ending drink. It was like a wine that never exhausted itself and brought eternal pleasure to those who drank it. But in drinking it they also needed to have an extreme amount of self control and discipline that had never been seen before.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry's Second Story</p>
<p>“This is a story about a woman” he said, “None of you know her, so don't ask me who it is, I met her a few years ago, way before anything here.”</p>
<p>He breathed deeply like the memory tormented him. Memories could torment people worse than reality, they were an imagined fiction that had forced itself into one's reality and sometimes burned people out from their past into their insides. Kind of like HCL.</p>
<p>“I'm with a woman, she's throwing herself at me, she has a thin waist and smooth skin, hips at a slight angle, blonde hair, and doesn't talk. She's the perfect woman. </p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox heard it and was displeased, what was with men and all of the women they talked about like trash. They were all attracted to the same formula. Perfect woman, she grunted, it was an oxymoron. </p>
<p>“I want to be with her, and we're together briefly, but she's always leaving to go off and do something. She doesn't fit in with the world because she's too beautiful for it.  To face her directly is blinding, shes too strong like the sun, so you have to have filters to look at her, looking at her through photos is amazing, or to look at her at night, or to look at her while she's with a different man, but to look at her directly is impossible.” </p>
<p>Mr. Angry rubbed his hands together, “I'm not making this up, this is a true story” he said. Although those two words were also oxymorons.</p>
<p>“Every man who was with her was in constant pain, because even though they were so close to her within touching distance, they couldn't reach her. She had too much beauty for a normal person of this world to handle. That was why she always had to leave her current circumstances. The men who were with her were in pain because they couldn't be with her. But the one in the most pain was her, because she loved all of these people she was with and they loved her as well. She had seen so many loves come and go, without being able to consolidate any of them accordingly. And I was so lucky to be able to meet her while she was still in her youth, before her beauty had fully flourished, but she had started to attract attention in the world. And when we parted, we both felt so much pain of separation, because were were supposed to be together, there was somehting wrong when we weren't together.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox stopped hating him as soon as he started showing his own pain in the story, she empathized with him and started to feel his pain. She had a growing respect for him, and understood how women could sometime be very cruel to men, just like men could be cruel to women, pain was a universal thing that wasn't restricted to gender, it was restricted to life. She saw it for the first time.</p>
<p>“She is a very needy woman” he said, “And someone like her needs to have a man who can be by her side all the time, she is afraid when there isn't someone there to take her through life. Some people are like that, it was unfortunate for her to be born that way. It could have been due to any small reason, some chemicals she was exposed to in the womb, or the father's personality, or an experience she had, needless to say, she always needed someone to cling to, to put her fingerprints on. And when I met her I saw that, and I walked through everything hand in hand with her. We experienced things together, all of the powerful emotions, love, awe, embarrassment, joy, and anger. We felt anegr together, when we were both angry we crushed the world into a pulp together and went and did things, then we later unfolded it and stepped back into it and lived again. We understood each other to the bottom of our lives. She was living my life just as much as I was licign hers. It was a perfect relationship, no questions about how close we were, or where we were moving.”</p>
<p>He sighed, the memory was still fresh in his mind, “But as I said, her beauty caught up with her and she become something more than a private possession, she became a public announcement and soon everyone wanted her. The richest men in the world wanted her, even nature swayed and shook to her echoes. And when you're one inexperienced man against that sort of power you can't do anything but lose.” </p>
<p>It was an awkward place to stop, but Mr. Angry stopped there. He had only described his most important romance, there was no structure, no ending, it was just a part of his life.</p>
<p>No one said anything, they just sat around. Mr. Melancholy imagined this woman, he imagined her dancing in a field, walking side by side with him, looking up ocassionally at him and saying something, everytime she looked back she wore a different expression, sometimes she was upset, sometimes she was speaking quickly, sometimes she was just tired. He didn't know what she was wearing, he didn't look that far down. But even when he was tired and exhausted, she kept moving and talking and dancing, he couldn't keep up with her.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy's Second Story</p>
<p>“Okay, so I'm going to use third person” Mr. Lazy said, “It's about a guy, let's call him Joe Schmoe, he's a normal guy, but he's got a superpower like all those heroes out there, he can't fight, he can only wink and smile. But he wears charm, and women smell his charm on him and can't resist it. He  says things that aren't funny and makes women laugh. He approaches women everywhere and they are so enticed by him that they wish to spend more time with him.”</p>
<p>“But he never asked for it, this superpower is not what he asked for, he only asked for a simple and peaceful life and raising a normal family with normal people who are fun to be with. He meets women everywhere and starts chatting to them, then he eventually winds up marrying a woman he met at a coffee shop, she was beautiful and appealing to him that day. He ends up impregnating her, and then he hits on another woman, and another, and another, and before he knows, he's got pregnant women all around him. They don't know about each other.” </p>
<p>“This story's weird, the weirdest one yet” Mr. Danger said. Mr. Purple squealed in excitement. She was actually really enjoying these sessions.</p>
<p>“He is a businessman, he's always travelling around the world to different cities, he goes from the cities on holiday to nearby tourist destinations. He ended up hooking up with a woman two plane flights and a five hour car trip away from his home, in the Philippines. One day at home with his wife, he gets a call, it's so blurry on the other end and people are yelling in a different language, like at a marketplace. His wife hears it and is confused, her eyebrows flurry up, like she's asking What is this? The woman in the phone is asking for him, he says he's sorry, he doesn't know who she is, and hangs up. His wife asks him who it was. And he says he doesn't know, it must be the wrong number.”</p>
<p>“Then after his wife is asleep, he retraces the call and goes outside to call back, the woman answers and immediately begins telling him she's pregnant. So next time on his business trip, he goes there to see her, and they sit on a bamboo bed and he hugs her and listens to her stomach, for the kicking.”</p>
<p>“When he leaves and goes back to the main city, there's another woman there for him, she was also waiting for him. This woman is married and has kids fo her own, but she enjoys seeing him whenever he comes over. And when he flies back home he is with his wife.”</p>
<p>“At work they tell him he's going to Britain for a new project, and he's excited because a great woman is there, she's still a University student, but he contacts her and she hesitates before letting him stay at her place.”</p>
<p>“Basically” Mr. Lazy said, “The world is his oyster, and he literally has a woman in every city that he can cuddle up with and listen to their stories.”</p>
<p>The group laughed, and Mr. Lazy felt offended, he surprised himself with how he felt, because it meant that this story was more personal to him than he realized. And then the offence subsided and embarrassment entered, because he was being so personal with all of these people. Usually people didn't talk about their true feelings with anyone, even married couples didn't. His own sincerity scared him.</p>
<p>“The wife finally finds out, that he has a trail of women, and behind them, a trail of kids. And she cries each time she finds out a new woman, because each of them is a different woman. But he personally is fascinated by each woman, how they behave, what they want, how their culture changes them, and he's probing deep inside them to understand.”</p>
<p>“He tells this to his wife, but of course she's even more horrified by the details. Just how many do you have? She said, Give me a number so I can work with it. She watched her kids playing outside and wondered if she would still be able to be with this man who she thought was her husband, now she was starting to think that instead of a man, she had married a shadow.  He was never home and was always fleeting, and she wondered if he gave the same amount of love to all of the other women, and she wondered if they knew about him. And then she thought about how insignificant she was to him. Even though she had slaved away her youth and the best time of her life for this ungrateful man. She weighed the options; should she give up on this man, or should she try and tighten the noose around him and try to change him?</p>
<p>“What do you want from me? He asked her one afternoon after he got back. She didnt' want to think about if his prick was still wet and smelled like fish, she dug through his suitcase and found pictures of the other family in there. </p>
<p>I want you to take care of your kids, they need a father figure she said.</p>
<p>That one's impossible, What's something else you want from me? He said.</p>
<p>Give me your loyalty so that I can trust you she said.</p>
<p>He fell silent at the dinner table and thought about it, the plates were left empty and she probably ahd to go and clean them, endless cleaning that she had to do.</p>
<p>I'll take care of the kids he said. </p>
<p>So you're not going to be loyal? Her eyes looked at him dearingly. </p>
<p>He looked back at her, Look, nothing's going to change, it'll be the same.</p>
<p>“It had taken ten years for them to have a conversation with this much honesty, and it wasn't a particularly hurtful think to say; but the way he said it, and aligned the words, and the timing he used, and the way they were standing on the beach with the wind against them and soothing their seething skin from behind, and the way the sand was carried and hit everything like a bullet targetmaking them close their eyes and see each other with only their ears, it worked. And because the beach was so flat and plain brown, anything was welcome.”</p>
<p>“Later he changed and went to a cafe, and there were pretty women everywhere, he started talking to them and wanted to talk to them more, they found him attractive as well. But then he remembered he was married so he couldn't, he tried to go do something dangerous outdoors but he rememebred he was married so he couldn't. It was a conatsnt repetition in his life. And then when he wasd tired and lost his job one afternoon, he was walking outside lost, and then he sees his wife, and he remembered he was married, and it was wonderful.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy finished. He was finished because he stood up and left immediately before anyone could say anything, how they were dissatified or touched.</p>
<p>Mr.Melancholy stared into space, he was too concentrated to notice, even to close his mouth was a distraction. He could relate to this story, he didn't know why Mr. Lazy was saying it, but he could relate to it as a guy. Because he felt bad about something, and this story helped him realize it. That he was juggling women in his life, he promised Annalise that she was the one he loved, but while saying that he kept Charlotte's number and was constantly texting her dirty things like about her getting naked for him and the things he is going to do to her. And she loved it every time he gave her attention. He felt guilty for doing this, and he probably made Annalise feel guilty as well, for making her green and jealous about the other girls.</p>
<p>He looked up and saw Mr. Chatterbox staring at him, he looked at her and she immedately looked away, but he could tell that she had been staring at him deep in thought.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lazy” Mr. Danger said, “If this was an autobiographical story, or a projection of your life, I would have to say that it's very disconcerting to see you experience something like that. Are you unhappy in your marriage? Are you wanting to sleep with other women? Are you wanting to be promiscuous?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy sniffed and leaned forward, “Mr. Danger, do you remember that one time about three weeks ago when we came out of the meeting and we were talking, you said something then that I remember fondly, I think that answers your question. And you also criticized me about the same things”</p>
<p>“Something about a keyring?”</p>
<p>“Yes, something about a keyring”</p>
<p>Both men grinned and yeleld in excitement, they slapped handshakes. “I understand now”</p>
<p>“But” Mr. Lazy sat back down, “You have no right to criticize me, your sexuality makes you experience a lot”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger frowned, “Do you mean that because I'm gay I'm promiscuous? Like I'm some kind of animal that humps everything that moves? Being gay is no different to being heterosexual, it's just that you prefer a different sex. How dare you”</p>
<p>The second batch of stories were longer, people felt more open and comfortable and had more to say. They all looked around, the bar was almost empty the huge crowd of people had left, the talking subsided, Charlotte had gone as well. The bar had big iron chains drawn across for its closure.</p>
<p>They sipped their drinks, looked around a bit, had a bit of a comparison of what they were doing, shared some small talk before Mr. Danger started his story.</p>
<p>Some of them felt relieved to hear another story starting, some were excited, some were weary. But all of them were happy to be a part of this community.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger's Second Story</p>
<p>“Imagine a beach, it's off the coast of a country with a name, it's long, longer than anything you can imagine and then double that. Then if you travel inland from any point of the beach, perpendicular, then you get to a city. Everything in the city is for sale if you pay enough, every corner has advertising shoved into it, all types of advertising, advertising that is so obvious, advertising that is offensive, advertising that is indirect and seems like it's generosity. And every supermarket takes the loose change and keeps it for themselves. People are so busy that they all walk along the streets at full pace, they have to rush to get to the next destination. Meanwhile, there are homeless people crawling on the ground like caterpillars, the fast walking people above them all walk around them.”</p>
<p>“There are big companies set up to sell products, they don't care if the product is good or bad for society, as long as there are short term, or long term benefits. People don't have time to talk to each other, everyone has schedules that are jam packed full like suitcases before a last minute flight, and everything is decided instantly by a large amount of people, responsibility is diffused and agentric personalities are everywhere”</p>
<p>“What does that word mean?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger went on, “It's a really shallow world, if you have money then people flock to you, if you don't they leave you alone. Some people don't have money but pretend to have money, some people have money but pretend to not have money. Some people spend their money on sex and gamble it away, some people take everyone else's money under a veil of 'legality'. The small young people growing up in this society must navigate through all of the bluffers and hustlers and prostitutes and shelves stacked with money, and find their own way in this messy lifestyle. If it were a room, it would not be tidy.”</p>
<p>“It's a really shallow world, and people have different judgments about everything that is done, if one action happens, there are one hundred people there to judge it, some saying it's good, some saying it's bad, one hundred different variations on how good or bad it is. People only see immediate worth, women are judged on their size and shape, like chips in a packet, they're judged on what kind of person they are based on how they are dressed, or how sleepable they are, so everyone has to create this frontpage cover of themselves to portray an image to others on how they choose to show themselves. Every man can only see. And so people can do anything they want to, they can treat each other like shit, they can be generous, they can scream at each other and swear, or they can share what they have and be empathetic, in the end it all just happens and then goes away. Some people have religious beliefs that say you can't do this or that, others have an opposite view. Amidst this chaos, the city is formed and grows larger every day. The city has identified the chaos that inhabits it, and denies any problems, ignores that anything wrong is happening and continues to expand day in and day out.”</p>
<p>“Then” Mr. Danger said, “There's a neighbouring city with people everywhere saying things that are preposterous, their city is neat and tidy, it is organized every night by cleaners, and everything has to go through detailed plans to be set out, there is a strong coherency where everything is comnbined with previous rules and regulations properly. It is a harmonious environment and everyone here will go to heaven. But because of it, the people who are different aren't able to live here, the people who commit crimes, the people who have mental illnesses, the people who laugh too loud or smile too greatly, the homosexuals, they aren't treated the same, and go to the neighbouring chaotic city.”</p>
<p>“This is getting pretty personal, I'm just speaking what's coming to my mind” Mr. Danger said, “But this story thing is really purifying and kathartic, it feels so natural and relaxing, thanks Mr. Angry for suggesting we do this, it's like a part of my life that has been missing is being revived.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy felt like he was understanding Mr. Danger for the first time </p>
<p>“Now let's say there's a man, a detective, he comes from the harmonious city, but he was hired to do a job in the chaotic city. He crosses the border and is told his job. He has to investigate a man and a woman. He gets a picture of them and finds out they're staying in a hotel. He has to try and investigate what it is they're doing. So he goes to the hotel restaurant, and just by chance he's very lucky, he sees them both sitting there having dinner. The man and woman walked in, she's wearing dark green, or light gray short shorts and is talking to her man, her arm is wrapped around his, and she's leaning into him, she's talking like she's used to it and she does this a lot. It doesn't take an expert to know that they just came from their hotel room where they were doing something together. No one knows what, he can only make assumptions, but the detective was hired to check, so after dinner the two go out somewhere, so he gets special access to their room. He opens their room door, there's a smell inside, of fish. He is suspicious, the room looks normal but there are clues everywhere. The bed is ruffled inh the corner, the pillow has been placed afterwards, the dust on the wall has disappeared, there are fingerprints on the floor and the curtains have been closed. The shower gel has been used twice the amount of normal. Then he finally finds the weapon, a used condom has been thrown into the rubbish. Now the detective can write off what happened”</p>
<p>“That's weird” Mr. Angry said, “It's just sex right?”</p>
<p>“But in this world sex is not allowed” Mr. Danger said, “For some reason it's a really big deal and if you're caught it's taboo. So the detective goes and reports it, then whiel he is reporting it, the woman is there, and she overhears him. She doesn't want her life ruined by going to prison, so she makes sure he isn't allowed to tell ANYONE about it. He has beenr aised properly with ingrained morals and a loyality to the detective agency, he reports it accordingly. But then she becomes desperate and tries to bribe him with her body. He says no at first, it's easy, but she keeps insisting, and he remembers it. The day before reporting it to the authorities, he realizes that he doesn't care about showing the truth anymore, he gives in to her advances. It was a dilemma and his discombobulation was trifling, he is conflicted because if he gives in to these advances then he might not be able to go to heaven anymore, and all that he has grown up with, his family as well, are in that city, but he won't be able to go back”</p>
<p>“He weighs the options carefully, it's just sex, he can just say no. But he looks over the messages the woman has sent him, and what she's saying, the dirty things, they look like heaven to him, and he feels so alive and free and wants to experience it all. And more than that, it feels natural. Sometimes sex feels taboo and guilty and he will be punished, but other times it's the most beautiful thing that can happen between two human beings. He decided to do it, and he goes up to her room, but he notices the room next to hers is open, and her man is in there. He's beyond letting the world know about what hapepned. And suddenly instead of going to the woman's room, going to the man's room seems much more enticing, it's beyond pleasure, it's doing what is right for him at this moment in time. He weighs the two options, the man's room, or the woman's room. Sex between a man and a woman suddenly feels so unnatural and his own genitals seem disgusting to him.”</p>
<p>“He goes to the man's room and they hit it off, and afterwards, instead of going their separate ways, it turns out they are really compatible for each other, and the man ends up liking the detctive a lot. He says that the detective is his type, and this meeting is so lucky, and maybe in a year he will realize that is the luckiest day of his life. But to the detective it's just another lay that he hasn't thought twice about. His parents and family will be so ashamed of him though.”</p>
<p>“Okay...” Mr. Chatterbox said, “That was getting kind of weird, and inconsistent”</p>
<p>“Wait” Mr. Danger said, “Can you guys let me tell you another one, this one will be very short and straightforward”</p>
<p>“Okay” Mr. Angry said, “Although it's against the rules, go ahead”</p>
<p>“Okay, so there's a man travelling with his friends, his friends are hunting a wild pig. They are all at a village and go out just after sunset to hunt this pig. They hear it all day, it's running everywhere, and the men catch sight of it and throw their spears at it, they finally capture it. But to the man's horror, every spear he has thrown has struck his friends instead of a pig, Mr. Danger has hunted his friend. When the men throw their spears they get a stack of pigs like a kebab, but when Mr. Danger throws his javelin, or spear, whatever”</p>
<p>They laughed because Mr. Danger got it confused, and the way he said it was unique to him and funny. </p>
<p>“You get the point, when he threw it, it never hit a pig but it hit one of his fellow hunters in the back or in the leg, and it disabled them. And they all looked at him and blamed him for hunting, they blamed him for all of the recent problems that came upon their lives. The man becomes so distraught and alienatd that he walks into the forest, he wanders around until he hears snorting. He thinks it's a herd of pigs, and if he catches one of the pigs and takes it back to the village he can redeem himself, so he keeps the pigs safe and goes in to strike. But when he goes in he seesa female pig, and then he drops his spear and goes and impregnatesone one of the pigs.”</p>
<p>“What? This is getting really weird” Mr. Chatterbox covered her face with her hand, she was both embarrassed and disgusted, she wanted the story to stop. </p>
<p>Mr. Danger considered stopping, but Mr. Angry encouraged him on. He was happy to be able to say more, he really needed to get this out, it was dark and nasty, but not everything was pretty, under every stone are insects that are crawling around, and it's only by moving the stone that you can reveal them. The pig's male other pig never came home because it had been caught by the hunters. Then the man realized he had to raise the child that the pig had. The pig gave birth to a child half human and half pig. It snorts, but it's human, and he has to love it with all his heart.”</p>
<p>“That's it” Mr. Danger said. “Sorry to disgust you, my story's done now, thanks for listening.”</p>
<p>“Is that how you feel?” Mr. Angry said. </p>
<p>“I feel like it's something natural that can't be changed, and so different and alienated, I guess”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger got a hug from the women, Mr. chatterbox hesitated, she was disgusted by the story, but now that it was over she felt a little better. And because Mr. danger was gay she could hug him without any feelings developing. </p>
<p>Mr. Purple was happy to hear all of the stories, all the creativity in everyone. She was starting to see that everyone was creative if they were just given the opportunity to be so. And if everyone was encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>But the more she heard, the more she became sad that her own views were irrelevant and small and less important as well. This was why she didn't want to tell the stories in the first place, because of her low self esteem. She always sat distant and apart from everyone, not because she was proud, not because she was antisocial, but because she was afraid of becoming irrelevant and normal. </p>
<p>But maybe the two were interrelated, you couldn't have low self esteem without having a high expectation and belief of yourself.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy's Second Story</p>
<p>“Okay, since Mr. Danger had two stories I have three” Mr. Melancholy said. “I've been wanting to tell them for a long time, looking at the trash on the table reminds me of it, and the trash I take out every day at work and dump into the big cans, which get taken away by bigger trucks, to somewhere where it all joins together and trash can be with trash...anyway. I'm proud I can say everything here, to have a place like this with you guys listening to my humble useless nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Aww don't say that” someone said. </p>
<p>“I'm proud” Mr. Melancholy said, “Everything here, I can throw it away, my job, my friends, my family, my hobbies, my words, my belongings, everything that makes me me, all these people need me, but I don't need them, so I can throw them away without feeling a sense of loss. But it wasn;t always like this, all of these things, once upon a time, were what brought me here. This really affects me, I don't know how yet, but one day I will. And telling this story will help me understand introspectively a bit better. And then one day I met the greatest woman, she is absolutely amazing and perfect, like Mr. Angry's woman, or Mr. Lazy's, but this woman is for me, my personal belonging. And I think she's permanent, that she will always be sparkly and polished without maintenance, and will never disappear. But then I become afraid, because if this is true, then I might not be able to leave her, so I can't commit. If it's not a disposable item, I can't stand it, because I am scared there might never be a rubbish bin again.”</p>
<p>“That's my first story, sorry it wasn't really a story, it was more fo a confession, in the vein of Mr. Danger's story earlier”</p>
<p>“That was beautiful” Mr. Purple said, and her gaze reached William and it tied for a bit longer than natural.</p>
<p>“The next story I have is about a dog” he said, “Please listen”</p>
<p>They all clapped hands in excitement.  A man walked past outside the bar, he had just been stargazing outside and come back, in awe and appreciation of the great nature. He  walked past the bar and heard clapping, voices laughing, people were enjoying themselves, and he felt happy for them, they were enjoying themselves in this wonderful world. He went back to his hotel room after searching for the key in his pocket.</p>
<p>“There's a little boy, it's autumn outside his house right now and the red leaves are falling from the sky onto the carpet. Every morning before the little boy wakes up, his parents have gone out to buy a new toy for him to play with. This little boy loves playing, he will play with anything, making up narratives and good guys and bad guys, big weapons and big worlds that they live in. He plays with the new toy, so excited by it, and after a few hours he grows bored and falls asleep. He wakes up the next day and has thrown the old toy away, he sees a new toy waiting for him in brand new pacaking placed in the spot where the new toys are placed every morning. He runs over and rips the packaging off, it trickles to the ground like a water, and he sees a new figure inside with a huge shield and long javelin. He plays with it, running around screaming, making names for it, making it win battles and wars. Same as usual, after a few hours he is bored and throws it away and falls asleep. When his parents come home he asks them for the new toy, he says he has already sleepened today and deserves another one. His parents earn a lot of money and to them buying the toy is cheaper than sending him to daycare, but he doesn't know that, all he can see is toys here and toys there.”</p>
<p>“The boy grows older like this and when he's a teenager, he is still playing with toys, they are more sophisticated and more elaborate and more expensive, but still toys from the way he treats them. He browses the stores and buys a new toy every morning, and in the evening chooses one old toy and throws it away. He's not satisfied with any of the toys, although he once was. Then one day he buys a doll and he doesn't grow bored of it, he keeps buying more and more clothes for it. After a month his room has no resemblence of soft toys, and it is replete with dolls and dress up clothes and make up. His paretns walk in the room and shake their heads,they can't believe this is a boy's room, what has their son been doing? The little boy, who's a teenager now, turns to his parents, and he tells them that he likes these dolls and wants to have them for the rest of his life. But the parents shake theit heads slowly. No, they won't have it, he isn't meant to play with these toys, they won't accept it.”</p>
<p>“The boy grows up to become a man, he has thrown all of his old toys away, but now has a different type of toy, he has photographs of these toys in his house, different people that he has been with, instead of dolls, they are real women, and he has wardrobes full of clothes, he has a chest with all sorts of accessories and a small perfume box to store the most expensive and rare and delicate smells he possesses. Every morning a new model comes to his house and he dresses them up, and by the nighttime they leave in preparation of a big party. He really enjoys making these models pretty in the world, it's one of the greatest joys of life to dress up and try out new looks, to be beautiful. But when his parents come, he closes all of the wardrobes, shuts all of the curtains, and hides the chests, then his parents walk in and are proud of him for being a man. Because he is at one with his work.”
Mr. Melancholy finished and looked around for feedback.</p>
<p>“That's similar to Mr. Purple's story” Mr. Angry said. “And Mr. Danger's story as well....like both of them combined”</p>
<p>“I must be influenced by them” Mr. Melancholy looked up at them with admiration. “If they had gone after me, then my story would probably be very different”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple sensed his worship and shivered.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy said, “We're all becoming similar, because we're all in the same place, every day we're slowly merging into one being, so you can throw away your individuality, and your freedom, those are just words advertising companies use to make you feel powerful in your purchases.”</p>
<p>“It was nice” Mr. danger said, “There's just one problem, it was supposed to be a story about romance, that was the criteria right?” He looked over to Mr. Angry, who nodded in tacit agreement.</p>
<p>“It is, I mean it was” Mr. Melancholy said. “That was my love life on a calm plain.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox's Second Story</p>
<p>“I was walking down a beach one time, when I thought of this story” Mr. Chatterbox said. “Now I have something to say”</p>
<p>She sat with her legs crossed on the couch, her drink was empty, and Mr. Melancholy could feel her cool arm beside his. She was really relaxed right now and didn't pay anyone much mind.</p>
<p>“The beach is full of shells, as you walk over them you're crushing more and it's the sound of the beach. The waves spit out more shells onto the graveyard of shells. One time on the beach there was a group of clams, is that how you call it, sorry my english was never good? A school of clams? That doesn't sound right?” She looked around for guidance.</p>
<p>“Go on, it's fine” Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>“There are a school of clams, one clam opens up timidly, it had been listening to all sorts of conversations happening around it and found it interesting. It laughed to itself and cried, as the conversations around it took place. All of the other clams were talking about things. So one day the clam decided to open up and see the world. When it opened up it was surprised to see that all of the other clams had opened up long ago, and they were talking facing each other. The clam felt left out because it didn't know at all and wished that it had opened up earlier and not missed out.”</p>
<p>“When the small clam opened up, the other clams started laughing, they all looked at it and laughed because it looked funny and weird. The clam felt so shy that it closed up again and hid in its own world between the two shells, it felt hurt, it never knew that it looked different to all of the other clams. It had never seen itself before, because all of the other clams looked at each other and described each other.”</p>
<p>“After the clam closed, the other clams yelled and asked it to open up, they wanted to see its funny face once more and laugh at it. But the clam was so hurt, it cried and fresh water came out. The other clams saw this, “Shh, it's crying, see, there's salt water”
“No way it's crying, that's just salt water”
“Hey, fellow clam are you okay? Open up, we promise we won't laugh”</p>
<p>“The clam was so hurt, because it wanted to join in the fun, but also because it feels like it isn't good enough and never will be. It also felt embarrassed that the other clams knew it was crying fresh water. But over time and afetr crying enough it grew tired and resistant, and slowly opened up, the other clams were all talking again, it saw the world slowly grow bigger as the two shells moved apart. But this time, instead of having a normal face, the clam stuck its tongue out and shook it, the other clams saw it and said it was funny and laughed, the clam saw them laughing in a friendly way and also felt happy. The other clams thought it was cool and copied it. Then, by being funny, the clam joined in with all of the other clams and was accetped. But the clam was always afraid to show its true self again without sticking its tongue out.”</p>
<p>That was Mr. Chatterbox's story. Everyoen clapped again. Then Mr. Danger voiced his interpretation, “It's supposed to be a romance story, remember?”</p>
<p>Mr. chatterbox looked oevr to Mr. Melancholy and giggled, she repeated what he said earlier, and he also laughed. “It is my romance story” </p>
<p>“Well, okay, whatever you say” Mr. Danger backed off.</p>
<p>“Was this what the story was about?” Mr. Lazy said, “Was it somthign about don't spend your life worrying about how to be like others, just notice what you have, and how valuable it is, and what you are able to offer with it, then go on?”</p>
<p>“Maybe?” Mr. Chatterbox tilted her shoulders and head and smiled. “I'm not sure either, I just really like that story”</p>
<p>“Maybe you could added this to the end” Mr. Lazy said,  “For example when the clam looked around, it saw that the other clams were also all making a weird face of their own, and not a single one of them was normal and not acting, so one clam could have a long tongue that it sticks out, another one could be a different colour, another one could be covered in barnacles or something, and make them all really weird and different and all trying to fit into the popularity niche with their own weird ways.”</p>
<p>“Maybe” Mr. Chatterbox said, “That sounds good”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded and clapped politely, but Mr. Lazy was really amazed by her perception and feelings. He felt like she was talking to him directly, she was thinking really deep to be able to tell a story like that, or she had a deep perception of the world around her. In everyday life she was always joking and living superficially, never serious about much, so he didn't expect this from someone so shiny.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple's Second Story</p>
<p>Everyone's gaze slowly setteld on Mr. Purple, it was coming to the end of the night and Mr. Purple's story would be the last one on the menu.</p>
<p>“It's going really great so far”one of them said, and everyone agreed.</p>
<p>“Let's have one last one to finish it off, and we'll see everyone at the next meeting”Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple started, she sipped her drink and it was the final sip, the drink was now empty. “This is my first love story.”
She put the glass on the table, and it was crooked like the neck of a giraffe or swan. Her cheeks were flushed, she was tipsy. “A woman has a pearl that she got from somewhere. No one knows, not even she knows. But it lights up beautifully with all sorts of sparkels inside like a kaleidescope. But it only lights up if someone is truthful, if they are lying, then there is no reaction, and it looks like a cheap glass pendant that isn't worth two dollars.”</p>
<p>“This woman knew this pendant's special quality and wore it around her neck. She didn't wear any other jewellery, she was a simple woman, she kept the big brands in her wardrobe and wore this pendant only. But in all the years she has been wearing the pendant it lighted up only once, ten years ago when her mother told her she loved her. After that, for a whole decade it hadn't lit up. At first she thought the pendant was broken, but slowly she began to learn that everything that was said around her was becoming a lie. For some reason the pendant knew this, and she trusted in its judgment more than ever now. In the decade she had walked through hundreds of men's confessions and through mens' desperate proposals and vain attempts to persuade her with shallow words. In all those years the pendant never was once satisfied enough to light up.”</p>
<p>“The woman had been thinking about these mens' words and promises and how they never fell through and revealed themselvesto be as empty as a pot. She looked at her aimelss life without anything achieved and felt like the pearl was a big burden, because she couldn't do what she wanted to do. Everyone around her was lying all the time easily, their tongue flashed different directions. She wished she didn't have the pearl in her possession and had never come across it, then she could live her life normally like everyone else. This pearl's blessing was the biggest burden on her life. She felt like she was dragging it along to make her distrustful of everyone. And it hapdn't happened in so long that she didn't even know if the pearl was supposed to light up anymore. She had almost forgotten what it looked like the last time it lit up.” </p>
<p>“She made a promise to herself, that the next time it lit up, she would marry that man. But she was naiive”</p>
<p>“Is it like this?” Mr. Lazy said, “The Pearl was always broken and she has wasted her life?”</p>
<p>“Shhh” Mr. Angry said, “Please go on Mr. Purple”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple smiled, she touched the rim of her wine glass, it was empty so she circled her fingers around it and satisfied herself. “So she lived for a bit longer and came across a man, as it always happens, but this man seemed appropriate, he was honest and sincere, he told her everything he was thinking, and he told her of his ambitions in life and what he wanted to achieve. She saw what her path would be like if she followed him, and she enjoyed watching him. He said he couldn't live without her, he wanted them to share the rest of their life together. She was touched by his words, and had never been so convinced of a man. But there was one thing that worried her, all of the words the man said, all of the beauty he confessed, and all of the dreams and love he conveyed to her had never made the pearl light up. It remained in its dreary glass state.  And she became upset, not with the man, but with the pearl, because she felt like it was deceiving her now, and had been deceiving her all this time and taking her life away from her with a fake belief that she had.”</p>
<p>“Fuck, this is interesting” Mr. Chatterbox said. Now she was leaning on Mr. Melancholy and staring intently at Mr. Purple, just like everyone else in the bar was. Mr. Purple was so beautiful and perfect, she wished she could be more like her, then more guys would like her and she would be happier.”</p>
<p>“She was out taking her dog for a walk when she ran into the man again, by coincidence. She was stressed from brooding over whether to throw the necklace away and be with this man when he appeared in front of her with a large bouquet of flowers. Well, he didn't have any flowers, but his huge smile and care towards her felt like receiving a bouquet. And then they start joking around so easily, then she gives him a test to see which is more sincere, him or her dog. She puts a can of spaghetti on the grass because she knows he loves spaghetti more than anything, and the dog does as well. The dog runs to her instead of the spaghetti, and the man can't resist the spaghetti. Then she laughs because he looked so funny just now when he was trying to take the spaghetti from the dog.” </p>
<p>“The man asks her why she won't marry him. Then she looks at him seriously and tells him about the necklace, because it has to light up, and if someone is truthful and honest, then the necklace will light up. She wants him to say something to her honestly. He grins, he's confident he can. And he puts his arms on her shoulders, moves his hand up to move some of her hair out of her eye and gazes into her eyes so deeply that it moves her soul. I Love You. he says.”</p>
<p>“She slowly tears her gaze away from him and looks at her neck, at the pendant, it's the same gray glass as usual. There is no change. She looks up and doesn't need to tell him, there are tears in her eyes because she was wishing it would change. But he argued that the pendant was broken, it hadn't lit up in a decade, and his words were dead honest, more honest than anything. To believe in the pendant and not believe in him is rude to him. He can't express his feelings like this forever to her because ti also kills him to say them and have no reciprocation from her. He asks her to marry him anyway, he wants her to see how sincere he is and how much he loves her, it doens't matter if the pearl lights up or not”</p>
<p>“Fuck, this is interesting” Mr. Danger said”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple picked the glass up, then indecisively put it back down. She was indecisive right now, but the story was set, she was sure of it. “Now she is in tears because she can't decide to trust the pearl or him, the pearl could be broken, but to throw it away is to admit that the last ten years of her life were a deception, and she has watsed her time, and it is also to throw away her past and her sincere belief. Was this man worth more than ten years of her life? She had removed herself from her family and friends all because of this pearl as well. She looked up at her man, kneeling down with a big ring, much more elaborate than this dirty pearl, it was so easy, all she had to do was say yes and she could be happy with him for the rest of her life. In the middle fo them the dog came and licked her leg, it saw the ring the man was holding and licked it as well. The man pulled the ring away, horrified it would stain from the dog. He looked up to see the woman still unable to decide and told her it was now or never, he couldn't wait any longer, he was getting older, she shouldn't be so selfish and sometimes just accept the things that came to her, especially when they were so easy. The dog pounced on the ring and he pushed it away. The dog was scrambling. She kneeled down to pet the dog, and it looked back at her. The man looked back at her, he picked the dog up and took it away so it wouldn't bother them. She was stadning there when he came back and she felt forced to answer him. She walked over to the dog, and petted it some more, the dog licked her hand and was excited to be with her.”</p>
<p>“When she looked down the pendant was sparkling, it had gold and red and green glittering through it like a kaleidescope, and red sparks sprinkling like fireworks. It was lit up for the first time in a decade. The dog kept licking her fingers, taking care of her. The man came over and saw the pendant, his hand holding the ring dropped, he told her she was fake and insincere, thats why she needed to believe such a pendant over him and his words. She had to be fucking kidding him that it lit up for a dog and not for him. She smiled, she knew her answer and walked away, keeping the memory of the pendant in her mind for another ten years.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple had finished.</p>
<p>“That was a beautiful story, thank you” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger pounced on an interpretation, “One thing the story says is that men are unreliabel and dishonest, another thing it questions is the honesty of people, how much can people be trusted, and are they really sincere? And another thing is integrity and steadfastness to hold on to your own beliefs, no matter how difficult or unrealistic they may seem, because the man was no good for her anyway, she didn't know that but the pendant knew.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy had a different view, “No, I don't think that's what it meant, the pendant wasn't that special, it only lights up once in ten years and she's foolishly believing it lit up for the dog, maybe it just hapepend to, isn't the story more about dogmatic viewpoints that are set in stone and don't change with time? They're superstitions that hinder us from real progress and choosing the best opportunities presented to us in life, being unable to see the world for what it is?”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox said, “Mr. Purple's story showed how men are unreliable and have the tongues of snakes and the tears of a crocodile, and because a woman isn't strong enough to know that for herself, she has to rely on some external force, in this case a pendant, but otherwise it's parents or friends, who are extensions of herself, and they help to accurately judge a situation based on many representations of it. That's what I got from it. Or maybe just that people are meant to marry animals instead of humans.”</p>
<p>The thoughts slowly died down as the atmosphere came back into play, they were in a bar, and they were a team of thieves planning something very big and risky. And once the realization sunk in everyone became serious and rigid, the talk was over, work started tomorrow.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the bar talk was that this atmosphere created this glue, and this time and place and what was happening, and it would probably never happen again. But once was enough for this miracle. And everything that happened was a miracle if you appreciated it. </p>
<p>The long night came to a close, each member felt like they understood each other a bit better, and it had been a long night indeed. </p>
<p>They dispersed slowly, like seeds in the wind spreading all over the world with their own views and ideas that had changed slightly from their interactions on this night. The trees outside howled as a strong gust rampaged past, and the clouds were beginning to clear so that the stars were becomign visible again, but strangely it was also drizzling outside and small water droplets were forming on the metal handrails leading down to the staff quarters.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-seven-the-one-with-the-chastity-belt">twenty seven: The One with the Chastity Belt</h3>
<p>Two people entered the bar the next day, it was a spontaneous decision to come and visit the Management hotel. They had just decided to come randomly at about midnight. They saw two others in the bar, a man and a woman. Samantha was playing guitar and singing to William. The two were attracted to Samantha's singing and walked in the bar, after a bit of looking around, they approached and started talking. Both parties laughed a lot in a good mood, as if they really knew each other well. Haha it's really nice to meet them. </p>
<p>“It's really nice to meet you's” He was the boyfriend, he was really nice and considerate and takes videos for her, and is kind on the phone to his brother as well, “Yeah I'm really good thank you” he said to the person on the phone.</p>
<p>The girls started singing the songs they mutually knew. The girlfriend had her hand on her thigh slapping it to the rhythm. She was excited and listening nicely, “Holy shit” she exclaimed at the woman's singing. She was impressed by this woman's voice.</p>
<p>Because of the time of the night, these four could bond easily with any strangers and develop bonds. If it had been in the morning, or midday, it would not be possible. </p>
<p>Then the woman on the guitar started to think that maybe her boy wasn't right for her. She didn't know why or where these doubts came from, but they just arrived like the two people they were with now. Tonight was a night of unwelcome thoughts.</p>
<p>As the music died down, the conversation steepened and the couples shared secrets about each other. The visitors talked about their relationships, he said that he had a tattoo of his girlfriend's name on his shoulder, her initials written in a huge font, he did it to tell everyone that she is his property no other man can touch her. On her body as well, is his name written under her breasts and fanny. The girlfriend laughs, because she doesn't mind him talking about this, she feels his love for her.</p>
<p>“We're in a permanent relationship, so there's no need to ever change or ask questions” the boyfriends said, “And we both understand this completely, no other woman can touch me, and no other man can touch her. My genitals are in her handbag, and I named each of her breasts, the one on the left is called Julian, and the right one is called Lucy, because that's what they should be called.”</p>
<p>The woman with the guitar had it on her knees, they were listening to the conversation now, her man still hadn't said anything, she thought this was a really sick idea, some really sick people were in the world. They had been talking with a good mood in a regular conversation, but now it was starting to feel negative and she wanted to go back to playing music. Why did they feel the need to tell them this? Did she look like she wanted to hear it? Was there a sign on her forehead that said Please tell me about your sex life?”</p>
<p>The boyfriend went on, and the woman nodded, William was still silent. “I bought her a present, and she wears it all the time”</p>
<p>“Lingerie?”</p>
<p>“No” his girlfriend shook her head, “My sweetie bought me a chastity belt”</p>
<p>“That's weird”</p>
<p>“Why? If she's not going to sleep around then there should be no issue right?”</p>
<p>“But if she's not going to sleep around then you don't need a chastity belt?” Samantha said. </p>
<p>“It's okay” the girlfriend said, “It's comfortable so I don't mind, I wear it with pride because it remind me of my darling. And I wear his hair as a bracelet around my wrist”She raised her arm and showed them a strand of hair around her wrist. “And only he knows the PIN to my phone, because I don't need to check my messages, he checks them all for me”</p>
<p>“And you don't see a problem with this?” Samantha said, plucking a string every here and there.</p>
<p>“We love each other so much, other people might think it's weird or too close or whatever, but it's because they're not as comfortable with each other and their relationship isn't as close”</p>
<p>The boyfriend nodded. They had obviously discussed this all before.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a man walked up to them. He sat down with them. The four looked at him, who was he? He was a similar age to them, and was determined and with a strong purpose. The woman felt a nudge pulse within her, he was a man with purpose.</p>
<p>“Hi, I'm Daniel” he said, “I heard you guys talking about chastity belts and was curious”</p>
<p>“Sure” the boyfriend said, and the girlfriend nodded. </p>
<p>“Sure” the girlfriend said, and the boyfriend nodded.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the ultimate chastity belt?”</p>
<p>Talk about a random question, what was this guy doing here suddenly joining them to ask this. He looked around apologetically, “Sorry to interrupt your conversation, I was just so curious.”</p>
<p>The way he said it stunned the woman.</p>
<p>“Sure” the boyfriend said,  “You mean the legendary one thats gone missing? It's rumoured that the most beautiful woman in the world wears it now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that one.”</p>
<p>“That's just a rumour, I mean if you look up chastity belts and stuff online there's not many listed, but every now and then you come across someone talking about the legendary one, it's the most expensive jewellery in the world by far, it's made of pure gold, because it guards an important part of the body, the mitosis part. But there's no way something that valuable could exist in the world without anyone knowing its whereabouts.”</p>
<p>“It's called reproduction, not mitosis” Daniel said.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, the reproduction part. I didn't want to say it, let's just say there are genitals involved”</p>
<p>“We get the point man, and then?” William, who had been silent all this time stretched his legs.</p>
<p>“Then, the rumour goes that the woman who was wearing this most valuable treasure in the world disappeared. She just disappeared off the face of the earth one day like she never existed, and with it, the treasure disappeared. So the story goes that if anyone can get their hands on the chastity belt, they get a hold of the woman as well.”</p>
<p>The boyfriend laughed, “Why are you asking me about this? Why would you ask me about something that doesn't exist anymore and no one really talks or thinks about.”</p>
<p>Everyone was sleepy, and Daniel didn't really have to answer, but amidst the conversation and loud talking that everyone was engaging in, he looked at William with a look that said I told you so. It gave William a reconfirmation that the mission would actually happen.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-eight-parents">twenty eight: Parents</h3>
<p>The large bus swevred a corner and came winding down the road, it pulled to a stop in front fo the hotel Management, the people got off like cows, and the porters raced around like ants, moving all fo the luggage to a pile and putting stickers on it for the room it was to be delivered to.</p>
<p>William saw the crowd of people, he got here at the exact time, and everything in the hotel was clicking as usual. In the crowd of people he went up to one elderly woman, she had a plastic bag of groceries and when she saw him she smiled and laughed, she turned to one of the other passengers on the bus, a sour grapefruit who compained about everything, and she bragged and pointed to William. The two of them, the woman with the groceries, and the sour grapefruit, called out to William.</p>
<p>“Hi Mom” he said. He apologized and told her he had to go to a meeting. </p>
<p>Ten minutes later he was sitting in the meeting with the heist members, they were meeting in broad daylight. Not suspicious at all. He saw his Mom outside, she was waving and everyone looked. He went over and greeted her because he had to. They hugged. Mr. Lazy, Mr. Danger, Mr. Angry, Mr. Purple, and Mr. Chatterbox looked on in confusion. </p>
<p>“My dear Willie” Mom said.</p>
<p>“Willie?” Mr. Danger was smirking. </p>
<p>She brought out the big plastic bag of groceries, in it were items from the supermarket that they couldn't purchase here. “Here, have this, enjoy it” she said. William looked through and felt like complaining, “Where is the sauce I wanted?” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh did I forget it?”</p>
<p>“Mom...” he shook his head. “All of this stuff...”</p>
<p>“It's good right, it will be useful?”</p>
<p>“Mum...” he says. He didn't need it, he didn't want it, and he started to get angry that she was doing all of this without asking him if he wanted it. She spent a lot of money to buy him these things that he didn't want. “Why did you buy these?”</p>
<p>“Just use them” she said, “They're a present from me okay? Don't complain and just be grateful.”</p>
<p>“Why should I be grateful for something I never even wanted in the first place?” His voice was rising and the heist team noticed it. They had never seen Mr. Melancholy raise his voice beyond 40dB, but now he was far exceeding that quota of noise permitted to him.</p>
<p>His mother looked around the room, “There's two young women in there” she whispered, “Have you noticed?”</p>
<p>“Yes Mom, I have noticed, alright?” He eventually took her to his room to have a look, she was tired and had a sleep there. He returned to the metting immediately, apologizing for the distraction.</p>
<p>When Annalise walked down to the staff quarters she saw an older lady walking about at the laundry machines, she later asked Misty who it was.</p>
<p>“I think that's William's mother” Misty said, “People were saying his mother came over” She was reading something under the covers, Annalise hadn't seen Misty's face in a while. Misty was always hiding under the covers and never saw the world, or even sunlight for that matter. She had even installed a lightbulb under her covers to make it a private space. She may have even decorates the sides.</p>
<p>As Annalise thought about this, she realized how she had come up with the story about the clams that she shared with the team the other day. The team she smiled to herself, they were all becoming such a normal part of her life now. The story was inspired by Misty always hiding under the covers, she didn't know it at the time but she knew now. And it was something that she had probably always been thinking about.</p>
<p>“I talked to others about you the other day” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“Really? What did you say? What did you say?” Misty was so worried that Annalise had said something bad. </p>
<p>“It was good, very beautiful” </p>
<p>“What did you say?” Misty didn't get it that Annalise didn't want to tell, or she did get it and was still forceful to know. It was a contrast in her character.</p>
<p>That night at work, Annalise saw William when he came to reception to ask if they had any mail. “Do you wanna meet up tonight?” she made it sound so casual. </p>
<p>He hesitated and she was worried that he would say no he was busy. He was always busy</p>
<p>“Sure” he said. </p>
<p>And then she was surprised at her own relief, and at her anxiety, after knowing William for this long, and being his girlfriend even, she still felt nervous to ask him basic questions. </p>
<p>She waited for him after work, she didnt' know it, but she was sitting where Charlotte usually sat when she was waiting for William. And she was also looked up for the stars because she liked to.</p>
<p>William came out, the door swung and a silhouette came closer. She knew it was William from the way he walked up to her slowly and carefully, because he couldn't see her properly, his eyes hadn't adjusted. And she knew that he was afraid it was someone else. He was shy like that. She knew him too well.</p>
<p>“Annalise?”</p>
<p>“Yes” she smiled, she was reading him.</p>
<p>“Oh good” he sat down next to her. And she didnt' say anything, she hoped he would begin to tell her about his life, about the things important to him, because this was what girlfriend and boyfriends did. She waited quietly. </p>
<p>“What was it you wanted to talk to me about?” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing much” she said.</p>
<p>“I gave up getting a ride back down to staff quarters because you were waiting you know”</p>
<p>So he was blaming her? Did he not want to be here? “I just want to be with you” she said it directly, pulling him back to her.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay”</p>
<p>That was all he said, and his response triggered a flurry of doubts in her that swirled around like bitter milkshake.</p>
<p>How did he not get it? She was his girlfriend, she just wanted to hear him say that he loved her, and talk about the things that happened to him today, and how it made him feel. And maybe even talk about his Mom visiting.</p>
<p>But it didn't go that way at all, “Look I'm going to head home then” William said, “It's a little cold”</p>
<p>Did he mean she was cold? Did he mean he wanted a hug? If he wanted a hug she did not want to be the one to initiate it, that would just be embarrassing. </p>
<p>Then he laughed. William laughed, she looked up in wonder, “You look like you're in a struggle or something, you look so confused, it's cute” he said.</p>
<p>The thoughts in her head faded, she started to relax. “I'm cute to you? Good”</p>
<p>She decided to say something kind of relevant that popped into her head, “Sometimes when you approach someone you have no idea how they're going to react, if they're going to be timid or strong and forceful or angry, it really depends on meeting them to know.” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded, “That's so true. Are you saying you don't understand me?”</p>
<p>“I just want to hang out with you, is that okay? I'm sorry if I'm holding you back from whatever you want to be doing right now, if you want to go you can, but I also want to hang out with you”</p>
<p>“You're very timid today” he said. “Now that you said everything, I feel a lot clearer about everything now. And I agree, when I came out to meet you I had no idea what this would be like, if you were angry and looking for someone to complain to, or if you were sad and needed a hug, or if you were happy and wanted to laugh together, I had no idea, but the moment I stepped out and saw you, I knew.”</p>
<p>“So what is it?” she said, “What am I like today?”</p>
<p>“You're like Charlotte today” he said.</p>
<p>The name was like a metal pipe banging on her heart, why was he bringing out her name in the middle of their conversation, she wasn't even here. </p>
<p>“You're doing what she'd be doing, that's why, she's in the mood you're in right now a lot. A bit contemplative, a bit insecure, I think.”</p>
<p>“Okay...William, do you like Charlotte?”</p>
<p>“I like everyone” he said.</p>
<p>“So if I were Charlotte now, would it be okay? Is it okay if it's any girl?”</p>
<p>“It'd be different” he said. And he said it in a way that showed her that she was no different to the other women, she felt like she wasn't special to him anymore.</p>
<p>They were sitting there, close to midnight, William wasn't tired, and Annalise was normal. Then a miraculous thing happened, in hindsight Annalise probably could have spared herself from this experience. </p>
<p>William's mother walked past, she was looking at her bottle and walking around trying to find somewhere to fill it up. That had made her get up in the night. She was a light sleeper.</p>
<p>She walked past and she and William saw each other. “So this is what you do at night?” she said.</p>
<p>William didn't flinch, his mother looked at him tenderly, she must have been so proud of her son. He had come all the way here to work and had made so many friends. Then her eyes slowly shifted beside William and stayed on Annalise. There was tension in the air, Annalise felt like his mother was protective, but this was their first meeting, she wanted to make a good impression for herself.</p>
<p>“You have many of these young girls chasing you” his mother  said “A handsome guy like you”</p>
<p>Annalise heard this and felt shy, because she didnt' feel young compared to the other women here, and she wasn't chasing William, it was just a natural thing between them. She was older and calmer than William, but she could also understand William's Mom's point of view. She only saw a strange woman sitting with her son.</p>
<p>“You should go with younger women, not like the old woman from last time” his mother said.</p>
<p>“She was thirty!” William said</p>
<p>“Yes, but that's too old for you, I love you sweetie and I don't want you to waste your life away while you're young. Don't make sudden decisions okay?”</p>
<p>Annalise heard this conversation and felt nostalgic and a teeny bit envious, her Dad used to be protective of her too, and he would say similar things. Hearing it now made her feel old...  </p>
<p>But to her surprise, William never introduced her to his Mom. He pretended like she didn't exist, he talked to his Mum normally about women and about his job and the things he was doing, he kep all mentions fo the heist out of it, and Annalise saw how his life was so colourful, he had so much going on and thought about so many things. Yet, he didn't tell her any of it, and she felt sad, like she wasn't fully accepted by him.</p>
<p>William and Annalise parted ways there, on the books it would just say they parted ways, and they spent 23 minutes together, but on a human level Annalise was dissatisfiedby this encounter, she didn't know it yet, but she would feel like something was missing from it. It would be an important experience for when she made an important decision about William in the future.</p>
<p>When anyoen asked her about her romance, she would still tell them that it was perfect and nothing was wrong, and William was the best boyfriend she could hope to have. It was just status hiking, to let the other women give her space.</p>
<p>William and his Mom walked back to his place, but instead of taking the normal route, he zigzagged all over and found ways to avoid encountering all of the women he's sleeping with. He had forgotten all about Annalise, and when his Mom asked him it took him a while to remember who she was.</p>
<p>They were more comfortable, the two talked.</p>
<p>“How do you like the job? You always sound so happy on the phone”</p>
<p>“Why are you asking Mom?” William sat on the floor, his Mom sat on his bed, he was reading something and she was flipping through sites online.</p>
<p>“Because I want my son to be happy, that's the most important thing for me”</p>
<p>They relived their old tradition by both sitting and listening to music together. William plugged his mother's favourite songs into the speakers and turned the volume down because people were asleep, it was entrancing. His mother's music preferences were very diferent from his. Although they both loved music, they couldn't bond with it, they could only try and support each other. But one song came on which they both felt the mood for, and they sang it together instantly, and he felt so close and wonderful and close together with his Mom.</p>
<p>William thought about how his Mom had come all the way to visit him from afar, taking a few days off work. She was always smiling and cheerful, so happy to see her dear son. He felt guilty because even though he welcomed her and showed her around, instead the whole time he kept thinking about all of the other things he could be doing.</p>
<p>He landed on a song that he really liked, and he showed it to her. She listened to it and was fidgety. He paused the song and described his interpretation of what was happening, and to his own surprise he started tearing up at it, because it was so sincere and heartfelt, he wished he could do something like that as well.</p>
<p>But when he looked over to his mother, she was listening, but she was fidgety, she obviously didn't understand it and wasn't thinking thinking about it. He struck the desk in rage. And she was shocked, how come he got so upset about a song?</p>
<p>“Because it's so much more important than all of those useless things like work and polite speech, this is real emotions and feelings!”</p>
<p>William's mother asked him what he was doing these days, “Are you being productive and changing the world for the better everyday?” </p>
<p>He sighed, he was going to have to lie.</p>
<p>“I'm working hard” he said. “You remember that girl earlier?”</p>
<p>“She wasn't a girl, she was a mature woman.”</p>
<p>William talked about his friends, he told Mom how Annalise was wanting to grow closer to him, he told her about Charlotte wanting to try something else, he told her about his boss who had been here for years doing the same job, and he told her of Daniel, and how he respected this man. He talked about his supervisor being highly qualified but still standing in this low-end job. He talked and talked for a long time about everyone else except himself. He distracted his mother from the reality that he saw. That he was a failure and was doing nothing, accomplishing nothing in life. His passions had been squandered with water, and he was useless and talentless. He was on the verge of being fired from his job after pissing everyone off so much. His boss told him that he had a bad attitude. And the outdoor activities that he enjoyed, like climbing mountains and being free, the other day he realized that he hadn't done it in a long time, and had lost interest in the things that used to be interesting.</p>
<p>But he didn't say any of that, he said everyone respected him and he was an important member at work.</p>
<p>The only progress he was making was the new group of friends in his life, but he couldn't tell Mom about that either, because they were al criminals with bad thoughts in mind. Criminals who were exploiting him and squeezing the immorality out of him and converting it into cold smelly cash.</p>
<p>He didn't need to say it though, the more he talked about it, the more his Mom knew that it wasn't as he said. </p>
<p>Mom sighed, “You know I love your passion and what you are doing”</p>
<p>She told him that she loved his passion and what he was doing, and was sorry if he played something for her and she didn't understand it or enjoy it like she was supposed to, but everyone values different things.</p>
<p>“William” She said, “Some people will tell you you're good, some people will tell you you're no good. But you're the only one who lives with it.”</p>
<p>For some reason those words cliked into him like a door lock, and they fastened all the bad thoughts in the apartment shut.</p>
<p>William was embarrassed to hear it from his mother, hearing it from anyone else would have been better.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried to fly, his mother really understood him the best, he had so many friends who he talks to about all sorts of insightful things, but in the end his mother is the one who understood him most accurately, and she knew what he should be aware of and what to work on.</p>
<p>The next morning his mother looked back before getting on the same bus to go back home. She turned and said, “I know now, you're an adult, you don't really have time for your parents, but contact us once in a while okay? And please let me take care of you, just take the things I bring you, it's all I can do for my son.”</p>
<p>In the next building at a different time, Angela was sitting on her bed with her computer on her lap. In the screen were her parents, her Dad was squashed to the side once more. She waved goodbye, she had to go somewhere. She put the computer down and went running out to meet her friend.</p>
<p>She went to the bar where they usually met and sat down. She ordered a drink and couldn't stop moving her legs in excitement. There was a gentle pat on her shoulder, it was so gentle that she thought it was the wind, she ignored it, then looked around, and Daniel was smiling at her. Her heart rose like a plane, she was so happy to see him. He had everything together, he sat down, the drink came smoothly, and he talked to her respectfully. </p>
<p>She began talking, she was comfortable around him to be open about things, and what came to her naturally was her parents. She talked about her Dad getting older, about her Mom's health deteriorating, but they never told her anything to make her worry, they hid it from her. But she knew because people change over time, and her parents are people as well.</p>
<p>She told Daniel all of this, about how the older generation criticized you for all of your thoughts that you have, because some of them are different, they worry that you are weird or wrong, when actually all the younger people are saying it. And you walk to another room and it's the msot normal thing. There's a big distance between people of different ages that is sometimes extremely hard to overcome. It's a generational issue.</p>
<p>She talked about her opinoins like this, but it didn't take longer to figure that Daniel didn't care. He looked at her admiringly, dreaming. He wasn't listening to what she was saying, she could be talking about world violence or pornography and he would be the same. </p>
<p>She felt shy, because he valued her so much and just wanted to be with her. She didn't care if he didn't listen to what she was saying, it hurt her a bit but that was manageable. She could change it in the future. Angela decided to not talk about these things to him anymore, because they bored him. But she would still love him with all her heart. </p>
<p>Her heart was made to love, and this whole time she had been looking for someone to love, now she found the person she would love him with all her heart and nurture him the best she could.</p>
<p>END of Parents</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="twenty-nine-were-using-it-for-good">twenty nine: “We're using it for good”</h3>
<p>A truck driver was getting bored, he was about four thousand kilometers away from the hotel Management. Or, five days. Travelling with himself and his daughter. Over the five days they kept picking up hitchhikers, the hikers had huge bags which they stuffed between their legs in the cramped truck.  There wasn't much space, but he enjoyed the company, and his daughter did too. The hitchhikers asked him where he was going, and he told them he was traversing halfway across the country, they nodded and grinned. He picke dup more and more people, until there were quiet a few people on board and it was almost like a bus. The conversations were small at first, but quickly grew as they began to learn about each other better as he killed a few hundred  more kilometers. </p>
<p>He was driving in the middle opf the night watching the bland road with the white centre lines never ending. He coudln't believe that someone had actually painted these lines one by one, all across the country. One of his passengers awoke, after an hour they began talking, an horu on the truck felt like ten minutes off the truck. This happened every night for five days with this passenger, and they became like therapy sessions in the truck while driving and maneuvering towards their destinations.</p>
<p>Every night the truck driver stayed at a friend's place, and met different people there and felt closer to each of them. His passngers slept in his truck. After five days of long travel he dropped his passnegrs off at a nearby tourist township, they were extremely grateful and shared contact details with him, inviting him to come and visit their places overseas, soft beds, hard beds, spicy food, bland food, awaited him.</p>
<p>He drove for another hour or two or a day, and reached the Management hotel. It was a speck in the far distance, the road to it was constantly winding back and forth and was hilly. It truly was in a beautiful place, in the midst of a national park. As he saw the hotel closer, he knew why it was one of the grandest in the land, it was huge and towering over everything, the nature was its back garden.</p>
<p>He came to the front door and parked his truck. There was no answer, ten or eleven large empty tourist buses were parked in their allotted shelves. He didnt' know where to park his truck. There was no one at the front entrance. He looked away back a the dashboard, and then behind him, to where the hitchhikers had been sleeping, before they left they had tidied up the mess they made with food lying around, and they left with smiles and optimism. He was happy he was able to do something for them, and it was always exciting to meet strangers. Now he missed them.</p>
<p>When he looked back out, in front of the entrance was a porter standing. He was dressed fully in black, down to his shoes and lips and hair. He was staring at the truck driver weirdly and blankly. </p>
<p>“He's handsome, but the way he stares is creepy.” His daughter said, she just woke up form her nap and was looking over the dashboard with her arm learning against the wall. </p>
<p>“Dad, where's the man we're supposed to meet?” She had come all the way here to see the hotel. </p>
<p>“We're a day early, I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow at Five PM”</p>
<p>“Daaaaadddddyyy!” she said, “Do we have to wait for him? Can't you call him up and tell him you're here today, and if he doesn't want to meet today then he can screw himself.”</p>
<p>“Watch your language. It's okay, this is a beautiful place, we can go take a look around like all the other tourists here.” They climbed out of the truck, and his feet were on solid ground for the first time in a long while.Now they were here he didn't know what to do and was lost. The past five days had been amazing, but because he was coming here, he had a purpose. But now that he was here the purpose seemed small.</p>
<p>The porter had disappeared again, it wasn't a tourist bus so he didn't have to mind it. He would report to his manager that there was an unauthorized truck parked outside. And a cute girl was in it. He wouldn't report that part.</p>
<p>When the two walked into the hotel, they realized it was the back entrance, which was always empty and used for large tourist groups. The first thing they noticed was beautiful piano music, a boy was playing piano in the corner, a mahogany upright stood carefully.</p>
<p>They watched and clapped when he finished a song. He looked oevr and notice dthem and smiled, then silently went on to play the next tune, and the next, and they found themselves sitting on the couch and listenign to him. Instead of walking around and trying hard to see the tourist spots, this was what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>The boy finished, and the truck driver went to him and told him that he was really impressed with the music, and gave him a bit of loose change.</p>
<p>“Dad, really?”</p>
<p>“It's okay”</p>
<p>The boy nodded, he seemed extremely shy, but very kind as well. </p>
<p>The truck driver told him how he had come on a long journey, and this was the msot relaxing thing he could have heard, so he will go home and make his daughter play, it's these small affirmations that let you remember how beautiful music is again and again.</p>
<p>The boy was kind of touched by their comments, but he went home at night and thought about it in his room, and realized that he wads really touched by it. Because everytime time he played, he didn't know if anyone would listen, or if anyone would enjoy it or not. And no one had given him so many compliments before. Then he felt like quitting his job, because this was what he really wanted to do.</p>
<p>Then when he woke up the enxt morning he forgot all about it and was focused on getting to work on time and impressing his boss.</p>
<p>The next day they had breakfast in the hotel, it was an all-you-can-eat Buffet. Everyone had a taste of it, some people ate quietly, some people complained that there were no more plates, the staff walked around handing out plates and stocking up the ingredients, in the back a few of them were polishing dishes, after they finsihed a load another load came in and they polished those, and then they polished another load. The plates were still okay, the cutlery was a real nuisance. They wore aprons and came out normally, sweetly.</p>
<p>Three women were talking at a table, they were speaking so loud that the truck driver and his daughter heard every word. They talked about the same things wherever they went in the world.</p>
<p>“Oh, you didn't know that we broke up? We broke up like six months ago, cause he's dating that new girl. I don't know, it was weird, because literally two weeks before it was all facebook official. And then I went overseas, and he stopped messaging me, and when I got back. We broke up in like June, but he kept messaging me when I got back”</p>
<p>“I never use Instagram, apparently it ruins your reputation with other people.”</p>
<p>“But he's a really sweet guy, why don't you give him another chance or something, wait how did you meet him again?”</p>
<p>The woman laughed, one of them curdled in embarraseement “He was a year above me, and no one thought he would be interested in people younger than him because he'd never done it before.”</p>
<p>“Oh my  gosh are you serious, that's like really dramatic”</p>
<p>“Yeah haha”</p>
<p>“gahahaha” They were all laughing.”</p>
<p>“Anyway on Monday he told me he wanted to see me, he told me, there wasn't a question about it, and on Tuesday at Five thirty six, he told me., and this was all last year, so he never got too serious about it”</p>
<p>“You're very accurate, with the facts and the dates and when everything happened.”</p>
<p>“Is he on your instagram?”</p>
<p>“Yeeeeaaaa? Like it's so obvious?”</p>
<p>“What' s your name? No, no,  I mean like ur instagram name”</p>
<p>The truck driver and his daughter sat silently, she leaned back and scrolled through her phone with one foot forward and he sat there moving his lips and looking around. He didn't know what to do with all the time. There was no wheel in front of him.</p>
<p>They spent the day walking around the native park, seeing some of the unique sights. “We're tourists” the truck driver's daughter said. The next morning they hiked up a small mountain and observed the highest mountain in the country from it. The morning glow was beautiful, they starded at it peacefully, then looked around and noticed a hundred other tourists around them also staring at the mountian in the same way and with peaceful looks in their eyes. </p>
<p>Then as the meeting time approahced they had nothing else to do, so they sat in the cafe. “This place is beautiful” his daughter said, as she sipped through an expensive milkshake that was probably filled with sugar and ADHD medication. “But after a day here I think I've had enough, it must be difficult to live here”</p>
<p>The driver and father, read his newspaper, it was the same newspaper he read from home, it talked about local details that had nothing to do with here. The two of them were doing the same things they did at home, even when they were so far from home. He didn't order antyhing because everything in the menu was overpriced.</p>
<p>Beside them was a lady who was sitting there harmlessly reading her daily newspaper as well. The truck driver saw her reading her local paper and folded his own up and put it away. He got up to order something, and when he came back his newspaper had disappeared, along with his wallet and his drink. In its place was a cigarette and a blue Post-It note stuck to the table, </p>
<p>I took your things, thanks</p>
<p>-Old Woman</p>
<p>He looked around and nothing had changed. But the old lady had gone. His daughter returned from the restroom and looked at him weirdly, “Dad, what happened Why do you look so distraught?”</p>
<p>“My stuff was stolen” he looked around the room with a bite in his mouth, each tooth was as wide as a candy. He sat down in his chair in the same way, but it was different. He was thinking about the old lady, how innocent she had looked, how powerless she was, just repeating a daily routine of reading her newspaper. Now he knew she was a merciless thief, maybe in her young days she was worse. He felt humiliated by her and was upset, because something like this just shouldn't happen.</p>
<p>The old lady  had been cutting up parts of a crossword out of the newspaper, in this digital age it was unheard of. She lived in the past. Then when she saw an opening she took, hid, and walked out without attracting any attention, she was a pro. </p>
<p>“Dad why don't you go tell someone?” his daughter said.</p>
<p>“I should right?” he said. “Yeah I will” He knew he had no right to complain, because he was going to be doing the same things to others by selling things to them. He felt like it might be a sort of karma stepping his way.</p>
<p>But inside he knows he has no right to complain, because he is going to be doing the same things to others by selling to them.</p>
<p>They got back down and waited at the cafe. They watched the waiters working constantly, for horus and hours, only a few people had days off. At 5pm the cafe was closing, a housekeeper came in and looked around the customers, he went and sat at the third table next to the window. After five seconds he felt a tap on his shoulder, a man and his daughter looked down at him. The man was unshaven and looked rough, he wore a wrinkled grey shirt and old shorts. His daughter was sprightly and young, she let her hair out in two ponytails that were on either side of her head, it was a cute look. She wore shorts tjat hugged her waist, and she kept glancing around at the guys in the place.</p>
<p>“Are you Daniel?” The man looked anxious and looked around very suspiciously.</p>
<p>“You must be Roll, you're delivering the goods to me.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, they're in the truck” The three of them stood up and left the cafe, they walked through the front hall and straight past reception. One of the foreign receptionists looked up and saw a man with purpose walk past. She hadn't see a man with purpose in so long that she felt a tinge of familiarity and like for this man.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you a question, if you don't mind” The truck driver said. He pushed his daughter to run along and unlock the truck. The truck driver walked slower and Daniel slowed down as well beside him. They stood in front of the glass doors and the elevator together.</p>
<p>“Sure, as long as you're not asking me out”</p>
<p>The truck driver didn't laugh, “I'm not a curious man, and I'm not very educated, but I have a moral conscience, and I'm not stupid.”</p>
<p>“Sure” Daniel said.</p>
<p>“When you ordered those ingredients, it's a bunch of random materials, but I'm not stupid, I know you're planning on maing a bomb, it's very specialized and rare, but I know it. I've also done the research before, if you combine the ingredients I'm giving you in the right way, it becomes a bomb, there's not much else you can make with those things” the truck driver sighed, “Tell me if I'm overstepping my boundaries here and making unnecessary assumptions, or if I'm actually on the money”</p>
<p>“Isn't your job to provide your customers with their products?” Daniel said, “You're a truck driver, you deliver the goods. So does it matter if the goods are gold or silver or bronze? All you need to care about it that the goods go from A to B. But you don't need me to tell you how to do your job, you've got a boss for that.”</p>
<p>“Look, I've got a family, my daughter's starting high school next year and she has dreams of becoming a doctor. I have to feed my family, but I don't want to be involved in crime. I think it's morally wrong, and I don't want my daughter to think of me as someone who assisted a criminal. I want to raise her with godo values and principles. What I'm saying is, you can take the ingredients I'm giving you and do whatever you want with them, just don't use it for bad okay? I don't want to see your name in the news, I dont' know what I would say to my daughter if I had sold you a bomb. You're just a housekeeper, I thought you had a bigger responsibility here, like a manager of some sorts, but you're just a housekeeper, why would you need these materials?”</p>
<p>“You can make a bomb out of anything, anything anyone sells can be used in a bad way.” In the elevator Daniel reached out and comforted the trembling man. “Don't worry, our team, we're using it for good. Don't turn on your TV for the next few weeks okay?”</p>
<p>They elevator doors opened and his daughter was waiting for him. He took her hand but she broke off, she was embarrassed to hold hands with her father, but she led the way to the truck. He unlocked the back and took out the ingredients one by one and gave them to Daniel. His daughter helped him move the small things.</p>
<p>“Where did you get these? Some of them are really rare” Daniel said. His housekeeping uniform had gotten an oil stain from some of the products. But he was excited.</p>
<p>“I stole them” The driver joked, “You can't get them anywhere”</p>
<p>Daniel laughed, “I knew you'd need to do something”</p>
<p>The truck went back. It was a lot lighter, and the earth felt comfortable moving beneath it. With each minute they were a kilometer further from the hotel and the resort. The truck driver's daughter gazed out the window as the hotel grew smaller and smaller until it was the size of a star in the sky. She had really enjoyed it, he was glad he got her to step outside the hosue and see a bit of nature.</p>
<p>But otherwise he had a growing dissatisfaction. It took him ten minutes and ten kilometers awaay from the hotel to realzie that he was feeling anxiety. It was a nagging in his belly like some bad food. He had always had it, but it never used to be this bad. He felt like a douche. Was it because he was away from home and had no stability now?</p>
<p>“That man” The truck driver said, “I delivered the ingredients to him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah I know Dad, that's what you do, it's obvious okay.” His daughter rolled her eyes and continued looking out the window with her arm on the frame. </p>
<p>“I couldn't say anything to him at first, we were too different.”</p>
<p>“Yeah...I was curious who the man was” she said. “Why...why did you tell him”</p>
<p>“Tell him what?”</p>
<p>“That...you do that to people but not to me” </p>
<p>He didn't know what she meant by 'do that'. She noticed his confusion and explained.</p>
<p>“Why did you tell others you steal? Why do you make up that kind of lie? You always tell me stealing is bad, then why did you joke about it?”</p>
<p>He stared back at her, “I don't know.,..” He was sad that she saw him as something else than what he really was. He wanted her to know he was a monster. And he wanted to say it to her. “I guess I just wanted to fit in with him, because it seemed like something he'd like to hear” he had thrown away his integrity for social acceptance, and it took his daughter to convince him otherwise. He had raised her well, or she had raised him well, he wasn't sure which. But he felt a sudden affection for her and one hand on the wheel, with the other hand he reached out and took her hand. They sat like that for a while.</p>
<p>“Eww gross Dad, why are you holding my hand, is anyone woman other than Mummy okay with you?”</p>
<p>“You're my daughter, I should be allowed to hold your hand once in a while. Besides, where did you learn to talk like that, you shouldn't talk about that kind of thing for another ten years.”</p>
<p>“Hehe” she giggled and leaned towards Dad, “What do you think they talk about at school? Are you shocked?”</p>
<p>“I'm shocked” he said, “So very very shocked”</p>
<p>They turned some atmospheric music on, and it started pulse to the rhythm of the car. They glided along like fish in a river following their natural course home.</p>
<p>It was ironic since in the crossroad out of the national park a figure was standing on the edge of the road with her thumb out. She had probably been dropped off here by a driver who was turning the other way from where she wanted to go. The driver was keen for some company, he pulled over for hitchhikers. He glanced over and saw that his daughter was asleep and brought the truck to a halt slowly as to not wake her.</p>
<p>He stopped the car and saw the figure, she wore a satin hood and had a newspaper jutting out of her pockets like a loose screw on a car. He recognized her, she was the woman who had stolen from him in the cafe. He looked over her and saw that his bag was sitting on the top of a pile of things she had in a trolley. He couldn't believe his luck, but the anger returned to him, and it wasn't a nice feeling.</p>
<p>He stopped the truck next to her, she knocked on the passenger side door, wanting him to open it. She was short against the height of the truck. </p>
<p>“Hey, is anyone there?” she called out, “You stopped for me right?”</p>
<p>The truck driver's daughter had awakened. With her sleepy eyes she reached out silently and yanked  her father's bag off the old lady. The trolley was filled to the brim with bags from other people and things happening, they were stolen into the trolley no doubt.</p>
<p>The old lady looked up, she had to crane her head almost vertically up, as if she were looking at a celestial figure. To her they were blinded by the sunlight and she had to put her hand over her eyes to see clearly. She could only imagine what the inside of the truck was like, it was so high up that it must be heavenly.</p>
<p>The truck driver sat in heaven and sweated. His armpits were soaked and his neck was beginning to look like a swamp. His daughter was sweating, he felt her arm brush his as she put the bag into his lap. Without saying anything she knew who this lady was to her father, and she should be.</p>
<p>The girl put the bag inbetween the gearbox and her legs. Then she rolled her eyes, and the truck went past, the body of it zoomed past the woman, she only saw the girl up high rolling her eyes in her little space up there.</p>
<p>She outstretched her hand as if it were a prophetic moment and with her stubby finger shaking, making her dry lips tremble, she started swearing profanities at the two of them and their truck.</p>
<p>The dust from the area lit everything up like a romance.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-dont-tell-anyone">thirty: Don't Tell Anyone</h3>
<p>Charlotte and William were meeting up again. They met on a day when Annalise was at work and she thought William had gone to bed like a good boy. Turns out not.</p>
<p>William never felt guilty, but looking at Charlotte today made him feel so. Her light was on in her room, it was golden and cast on her figure like something out of the ordinary, it glowed on her and her silhouette was over her. She looked at him expectantly with eyes of long term hope and love that would be rewarded back to her. She knew she was the other woman, but she didn't act any different.</p>
<p>William was confused, he wanted to talk about the heist but he wasn't supposed to share it with anyone. If anyone uninvolved knew about it, it could cause a catastrophe to their lives. So instead of telling Charlotte, he hinted at it loosely. Maybe not loosely enough...</p>
<p>“Charlotte” he said, “I have something I have to tell you”</p>
<p>Charlotte looked at him with eyes glimmering like the stars. She waan't going to admit it, but a proposal would be favourably accepted. In her room the golden light was strong, it was pitch black outside, a fly buzzed around the room, like a surroudn sound speaker system. Whenever it came near, she raised her hand to slap it away. “What is it William?”</p>
<p>“It's about our future” he found it difficult to say, “It might not turn out to be anything, I mean it might be nothing” </p>
<p>“What do you mean?” What he was saying hit her like a bell for after class. “Are you breaking up with me?”</p>
<p>“No, no” William said, “It's just that there's something happening in my life” William was confused now, he was beginning to mistake things, he knew Mr. Chatterbox was a part of the heist, but he had difficulty figuring out who Mr. Chatterbox was in real life. Was it Charlotte? Or was it Annalise? Their faces looked so similar that it was hard to tell right now.</p>
<p>He decided that this woman in front of him knew about the heist, but was pretending not to. A kind of paranoia had evolved in him and hit a vein of action. “That big crime we're involved in” he said.</p>
<p>“What big crime?” Charlotte said. “Oh, are you talking about the dirty things in my room?” She slanted her eyes, “William, oh you promised not to talk about that, you know how embarrassed it made me”</p>
<p>“No” William said, “I mean those regular gatherings we have to discuss the heist.”</p>
<p>“Is this some sort of game?” Charlotte said, “If it is, then teach me the rules?” She stared at him so wholeheartedly and naively that he realized it was the wrong person, Charlotte wasn't involved in the heist, it was Annalise. Mr. Chatterbox was Annalise. </p>
<p>He never shouldn't have mentioned it. Charlotte stared back at him waiting for an answer, and William was struggling to come up with an excuse or a lie. But he fell blank. He only looked at her eyes, searching for something to say, and also ashamed at himself for not being able to tell the difference between these women.</p>
<p>“What was that about?” she said, “William, are you stealing something? Or was that a big joke?”</p>
<p>“It was a joke” William tried to laugh, but he couldn't. Charlotte laughed instead, but not without before taking some doubt and concealing it in her heart preciously.</p>
<p>“Will it make us rich?” Charlotte said. </p>
<p>“Us?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you're stealing, will it let us buy our freedom?”</p>
<p>“Freedom isn't bought, it's won” William said.</p>
<p>“Whatever” Charlotte said, “It was a joke anyway, so who cares right?” She slunk on her bed, then as if deciding something pushed herself off the bed and went to switch off the light. “You can stay here and fuck me silly, or you can go home and sleep, whatever you want, whichever is fine with me.” He heard her soft voice in the room like a curtain that blushed over the windowpane.</p>
<p>William left her room dissatisfied. He was surprised by Charlotte guessing about the heist, and felt guilty for betraying Daniel. He felt surprised because Charlotte never seemed like one to care about money or freedom, she just lived carelessly and worked everyday. He was afraid at her use of us. She saw them as joined at the limb, and that scared him.  And he felt doubtful of his own memory and its reliability that he would confuse her face. </p>
<p>And then he realized he must love her. </p>
<p>He wondered when the next time he saw her might be. He wondered if he could sit somewhere romantic with her and gaze at the stars or sit on a coastline with no one around them, and they could spend their time together.</p>
<p>Instead of falling asleep, he woke up. He wandered to the back of the hotel, it was a relaxed atmosphere, a boy was playing the piano. He was really good, and William sat there enjoying the sound and feeling the music. The boy noticed him but probably wondered whether this person liked the music or found it a nuisance.</p>
<p>Most of all he found it strange that Charlotte was excited by the heist. When all of them were dreading the day it came like the apocalypse. </p>
<p>As he sat there watching the boy play the piano, a different woman walked in, she was wearing a nightgown that stuck out at her sides and had pink bears smiling designed onto the fabric. Her hair was messy and she was combing it as she walked in. She saw William and froze, like a deer that had just seen a car.</p>
<p>William finally recognized her, his memory shocked him. It was Annalise, she looked different to how he saw her in the meetings but it was definitely her. </p>
<p>She saw him and smiled, it wasn't an excitement, just a notion of being happy to see him finally.</p>
<p>“Girlfriend” he said, motioning for her to sit down next to him and listen to the piano together. “After the heist” he said, “What's going to happen to our future? Will it be worth living?” He waited for an answer, “I accidentally told Charlotte about the heist”</p>
<p>Annalise combed her hair slowly, each brush stroke collected a few hairs and aligned them next to their friends. When each friend faced the same way she turned to him as well. At this time fo the night there was no space for jealousy or angst, only a calm meditative relaxation and respect for everything around her.</p>
<p>“I'm touched” she said because of the respect in her heart. “I'm flattered that upi are considering a future with me. I was too afraid of mentioning it, because I'm not sure myselfof what's going to happen. How can we possibly stay together, tonight you said you were going to sleep,but you went to see her.” The way she said it sounded like she was swallowing poison and preparing for Harakiri.</p>
<p>“It was because she looked like you, I made a serious mistake” William said, “I don't trust my own judgment anymore, and every action I decide on makes other people around me sad or happy, it's just too much responibility. And I wanted to tell you, Annalise. But I hardly recognized you as well. Maybe it's just this night, but it's like my senses have vanished, they were stolen by a ghost that wants to be human.”</p>
<p>The way William saw it, there were three of Annalise. There was the Annalise at work behind the reception desk, the Annalise who was naked and in bed with him and talked a lot and not much at all, and then the Annalise who was a cold calculated killer and highly dangerous criminal who was involved with him in an immense crime. He didn't understand how she was able to do soemthing so violent and then smile at him kindly in her room. </p>
<p>Of all the things he told her, she caught on to just one, “You told Charlotte?”</p>
<p>He nodded, then she shook her head, “You can't do that”</p>
<p>“Do you think Daniel will be upset?”</p>
<p>“Daniel will be so upset if you were to tell anyone” she said. “You know that, you don't need me to confirm it for you”</p>
<p>She paused and sat on her bed, the way Charlotte had been sitting in her room. “We're all criminals, I don't know your history but you're one too. And Mr. Angry is a big criminal. He's listed in the charts for horrendous crimes, rape, murder, solicitation, financial fraud, tax evasion. He's done so many that he's a genius of disobeying the law. Society will be better off if he doesn't exist” she said, “It's scary how just one man alone is able to cause so much damage to the world. It makes our society seem fragile”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Our boss Mr. Angry's CV, if you check it, will have crime after crime listed, he's tried everything you can imagine. And in these crimes he's got a consistent way of treating the women in his life who mistreat him. He poisons them, like in the Greek plays, he carries around a small jar which says Nail Polish Remover. He has killed all of the women that he has been with up until now, he puts poison on their lipstick. </p>
<p>“Will he kill me?”</p>
<p>“You're not a woman so you should be fine” Annalise said, “But I need to watch out”
In her room, Charlotte heard a knock at the door, she went over and opened it. She expected William and so left herself dressed casually, but it was not William, a tall dark man in a housekeeping uniform stood at her door, he fit the door frame perfectly. He was expressionless, like all of the expressive nature of his face had been drained long ago, drop by drop.</p>
<p>“Why didn't you put on your lipstick?” he smiled, “You look so beautiful with it on”</p>
<p>This man was Daniel. She felt a shiver go up her back. He looked at her coldly without any warmth, she blamed it on the time of the night, no one could be this cold during the day. </p>
<p>But even when he was so rude she still found him sexy. He would possess her completely and guide her through a path of pleasure, she knew it. Then she felt ashamed, she couldn't believe herself, her base nature was so greedy. Did he poison this lipstick as well? Or was he being genuine?</p>
<p>All this thinking happened as she stood at the door for a few seconds with one hand on the doorknob, the other hand supporting her weight against the door frame. He held out a tube of lipstick that was orange and looked like it had been painted recently.</p>
<p>“There's a lot of men, some are big men, some are small men, some are happy men, some are unhappy men. Some men are funny, some men are boring as fuck, some men are serious, some men are easy going. Some men are organized, some men lose everything, some men have integrity, some men are loose. Some men have a future, some men live in the past...”</p>
<p>“GG, I get the point” she said, “I'm human you dumbshit”</p>
<p>In the end she reached out for the lipstick and smeared it on, and walked out, looking marvellous and gorgeous and catching all of the eyes...</p>
<p>She walked past William one day and wondered why he didn't turn, if he doesn't turn his head then it was pointless. She wasn't going to be one of those weak women who worried that her appearance wasn't good enough and getting nervous over it. Then she looked at the kind man from the other store.Why is Daniel telling her about other men? She didn't want to be with other men... Maybe that was why she was so rude to Daniel. She felt bad about it now, she shouldn't be using those words.</p>
<p>Instead she went into the bathroom and stood n front of the mirror. Guests from the hotel kept coming in and leaving, they looked at their reflections while they washed their hands and then left. Some women didn't even wash their hands, and that's why they weren't married. Because a man would never marry a woman who left the toilet seat up and didn't wash her hands, it was just chosoe one of them, two was a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>She stared at her reflection and saw it as a jewel box. What did William see in her? He was such an amazing guy, compared to her who was so insecure and low, and there were so many othe rprettier women than her just in the hotel even. If there were ten women, she thought she could rank about halfway. She didn't compare the the pretty girls, like the woman who checked in today with a nice dress and a man on her shoulder squawking away into a phone. She was so pretty, that's why she could get a rich husband. Or the two teenagers who were just starting out in life. They were beautiful so had everything going for them. </p>
<p>What was the glue that would attract William to her life? She wondered how she could talk to him, what could she do to get him to notice her more and actively try to spend time with her? Should she act more bad, more careless and swear a lot? But that might just drive him away further. Maybe she should act like the girl next door, because guys always liked that. She could be the quiet and pristine perfect girl that he idolized. And she wanted to, but everytime she tried, she started to feel dejected because the other girls were so much prettier than her. She felt like no matter how she dressed and how she laughed, she would never be enough for him, and the other girls could do it better. </p>
<p>Last time she was able to talk to him a little bit, about herself mainly though, she didn't learn about him, he didn't tell her much. And she wished she could talk to him like that again, when he seemed so interested, and she could tell him her things. And he could tell her his things, and it was the start of a nicely balanced relationship.</p>
<p>It was strange, when Charlotte when into work the next day she saw William at work. He wasn't doing very well, slow paced and making a lot of mistakes. He looked like a useless person, he didn't have any talents in the job, and didn't enjoy it. The others around him knew so and treated him different. Charlotte felt sorry for him. She wanted him to do something, but then she felt bad and insecure for him, she really could relate.</p>
<p>But when he talked about the crime the other day it really excietd her, because he was doing something, it meant he wanted to change his life. He could see that he was going nowhere and  collecting dust. He finally told her something, he always kept quiet, but when he spoke she made sure to listen, because that rare occasion when he spoke was when he really needed her, and she could support him. She felt a strength well up in her, and a real meaning for her existence.</p>
<p>Daniel came up to her again, this time he didn't have any lipstick to offer her, but he wore the same expressionless expression. He waited for her in the spot where she waited for William. She didn't like it, but she didn't tell him so. She had just finished work and wasn't in the mood for this.</p>
<p>“Did you hear about the heist?” he said. He tried to act friendly but he just sounded fake. </p>
<p>“No” she lied. </p>
<p>“You know, if you by any chance have found out about it, then I'm going to kill William” he looked at her dead seriously. She froze with his words, like a chicken just brought out of the freezer after a long hibernation for Waitangi Day dinner.</p>
<p>“What, I beg your pardon?” Would he apologize and say it was a joke? She wondered how he knew, Did William tell this man he respected everything about all the confidential things she told him? Even about how she waited for him on this bench? It was strange, how could he possibly know so much about her.”</p>
<p>Now Charlotte felt insecure for William, he had gotten himself into something really serious.  “I don't know anything” she lied, “What, is there something I should know about William?”</p>
<p>Daniel looked at her silently, he was trying to read anything from her expression, anything telling him that she knew.</p>
<p>“Well?” she tilted her head and crossed her arms. “Is he cheating on me or something?”</p>
<p>Daniel groaned rolled his eyes and walked off. </p>
<p>She stood in the same position, and after he had gone she collapsed to the floor in a mess, scared that he would find out. That man was unbelievably scary.</p>
<p>William never found out about the encounter between Charlotte and Daniel. He knew about the encounter between Annalise and The hotel porter on Tuesday afternoon. But he never knew that  Charlotte lied and protected him. That day after work William felt loneliness creeping up to him, but he didn't admit it and called up the women in his phone. It was either Annalise or Charlotte, he scrolled through their profiles, he compared the two, then called Charlotte up.</p>
<p>Charlotte didn't know it, but Annalise found out about this, and the next time she went to work on the same day that Charlotte was working. Annalise wondered if William had told Charlotte to join him in the heist. There was no logical basis or any reason to suppose this, but she felt a paranoid anxiety that was so strong it was inhumane. Like one of the emotional gods was making her feel this way. Everytime the emotional god did something like go to the bathroom and press the flush, or brush her teeth, it made the humans below, down on earth to feel a certain way. That was what she believed. So it wasn't her fault to feel this way. </p>
<p>She felt betrayed and left out, and her personal value had depreciated. She caleld in sick on the day when Charlotte was supposed to work with her, because she couldn't handle the stress on this special day.</p>
<p>Charlotte noticed Annalise, who never called in sick, hadn't turned up for work, and asked Annalise about it the next time. Annalise answered simply, her tone hid all of her intentions and anxiety that had been brooding in her like a steam pot full of toxins. “I was tired and had stuff to get done at home”</p>
<p>Charlotte looked relieved, and it was hard to describe why, but Annalise felt safe seeing that reaction. She looked into Charlotte's eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh good” Charlotte said, “I thought it was because we weren't friends anymore.”</p>
<p>“And? How does that make you feel?” It was important to know how Charlotte felt, many things were important, but that was probably the most important thing right now.</p>
<p>“I'm glad that's not the case” Charlotte stopped her typing into the computer and looked back at Annalise on her left. To the guests at reception they were two normal staff working in a high class hotel, wearing their uniform and smiles and their role appropriately.</p>
<p>Then Annalise felt guilty, but she also wondered whether that was the case or not. And then she stopped wondering.</p>

<h3 id="thirty-one-river-excursion">thirty one: River Excursion</h3>
<p>Daniel's plan was beginning to become a reality. He had analyzed everything, all of the possibilities, and was excited at his vision finally becoming a reality. He sat in the hotel cafe, outside on the verandah and sipped a coffee. He had so many things happening in his life, and now they were all coming together as one. The heist would be happening soon, he could feel it in his blood. This was what he was born to do, like a baby was born to cry, a woman was born to love, and a man was born to work. His born stamp was for this. It was his purpose.</p>
<p>Today they were having a meeting in the dead of day, the sun was overhead them and casting shadows on all the bad people in the world. Everyone looked around to see who had the shadows and who didn't. Five seats were organized in a semi-circle facing one throne. The cafe staff were tired of granting these requests, all they knew was that someone high above was involved.</p>
<p>Five of them were there, they were drinking iced coffees and wore sunglasses to block out from the shade. The sun was so bright and it reflected off the shiny plastic surface of the table and into everyone's eyes. They had to squint while drinking, and double look at everything they let into their mouth. </p>
<p>Mr. Purple had to hold herself back, when she looked down she saw herself grasping Mr. Danger's finger. She thought it was a chip. They looked like five lightbulbs sitting there. Mr. Angry coudlnt' figure out who was missing so he decided to call their names.</p>
<p>“William isn't here” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>A stranger came over, it was too bright to see his face, Mr. Lazy held his hand above his head to try and see who it was, and then moved it below his eyes. “Hey you're the painter right?” He spoke to Mr. Purple. She denied it, but he insisted. </p>
<p>Later as Mr. Angry began to speak, two women came up and told Mr. Lazy that they knew his wife. And then three more people joined them and they sat at the table together with the thieves. There were al sorts fo random people, one man came over and sat down because he heard music. Someone's brother came to join in, and afetr a whiel everyone was there, and it was too bright as well to discuss anything. Mr. Angry clenched his fists, they pumped full of rage and frustration. He wasn't angry, he knew when he was angry, but the whole world was mistreating him, they were all angry at him. </p>
<p>He couldn't dicuss the heist today. He felt like gettign a gun and shooting things up. But left that until the heist, it was all for the plan. He looked around and saw that he was the onloy one upset and holding onto it, everyone else thief or not, were enjoying the company. They were laughing and treating each other as equals.</p>
<p>They sat there for the whole afternoon, turns out everyone enjoyed it a lot more than they expected. The thieves stayed behind, and one of them, Mr. Lazy, suggested they go to the beach. It wasn't the beach, but the river closest to them that meandered and made a small rocky shore. </p>
<p>The five of them, in one file walked to the beach. Mr. Angry took the rear like a steering wheel, he called out from the back which way was the quickest. Mr. Lazy was at the front as the indicator, and Mr. Chatterbox and Mr. Purple were the side mirrors who checked for obstacles. Mr. danger was the kid, he complained every two minutes if they were there yet. </p>
<p>As they walked along in a file, two men walked past them from the other side, coming from one of the hostels near the fiver. One man was old and every wrinkle had been etched into his skin with an experience of pain. It was his personal branded tattoo. He wore normal clothes and smiled normally,he was forty six and looking for a woman to spend the rest of his life with. He foresaw that this woman would see him and they wouldn't have to share a single word, because she would read his character from the suffering he had been through and know his whole life story instantly. </p>
<p>This man's name was James. “James” his friend said. The friend was a normal person. If you took all of the averages in the world, average intelligence, average height, average sense of humour, average clothing, average looks, average-sized abs, average lifespan. Then you would get someone like this friend. </p>
<p>“Did you foresee that?” he said, “What did you see?”</p>
<p>“That woman we just passed...” James said.</p>
<p>“She's average” James said, “Not hot, not ugly, she's fuckable though:</p>
<p>“no, No, NO!” The man shook his head, grasped his ears and shrunk down onto the ground wailing. He looked like a tree that had lost a branch and lost balance. After James was done writhing on the ground he stood up normally. </p>
<p>“Was it one of your prophecies? Because I know you can tell good people from bad people, that's your talent”</p>
<p>“You know it” he said, “When we travelled to the land with many hills together, I saw that man and told you he was a bad person, and look what happened a week later? And when we went to the flat land of no wind, I pointed to the woman and told you she was good? All of that doesn't matter in the face of that woman I just saw. I can distinguish good from bad in everyone, and those five people back there, they're all thieves. But the woman in the middle wearing black, the one they call Mr. Purple, she is the scariest woman of all” James was shaking again,from the root of his elbows to the tips of his hair. Something felt extremely wrong. He was afraid and hid down in the grass, afraid she would look back at them. It was strange because he was never afraid of people, he could see their true selves. But when he saw her he had seen the worst.</p>
<p>“Someone like her really exists...” His master had told him about a woman who would bring the world to ruins and chain it up like a car tire going up a snowy slope. He felt difficulty breathing, and it soon expanded into a full blown panic attack. He collapsed on the ground again, his legs gave in from the fear and shock. “She's the woman who's going to bring about the apocalypse”</p>
<p>“What can we do?” the friend said. </p>
<p>James breathed deeply, he breathed in and out, “There's nothing we can do, we can tell people all we want but no one will believe us. That's the burden of my blessing” he said. I can neverbe ignorant and treat strangers well I I know they're bad people. And when I treat strangers who are good people well they think I'm weird.” He shook his head,</p>
<p>On the way to the river, Mr. lazy turned the walking car towards the Church, it was on the side of the river and was a popular tourist destination. No photos were allowed in the Church. It had a spectacular view of the lake at the base of the river, but at this time fo the day only locals were left behind.</p>
<p>By some strange force they were unfamiliar with, the thieves filed into the church one by one. They felt drawn to it like a human being was to its Creator. They saw the beautiful spirals stretching high into the roof all around them, they had to crane their necks to see that high up. Around them were stone walls that had been burned and dusted, gone through human civilization and death like it was a daily routine. And the cross stood in front of them so majestic, lit up by the gentle candelights of the prayers of worpshippers.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>They stood side by side in the church, gazing at the world around them. It was quickly growing dark outside, and when they exited, the light would have all but disappeared.</p>
<p>“It's a Church” One of them said. “You're not allowed to draw blood in one of these places”</p>
<p>“I wish I found a Church earlier” she said. “I wish the whole world was a Church”</p>
<p>Then suddenly they were all so touched by it, this is how they wanted to live their life. They were all going to be saved, the Creator understood them and their struggles. </p>
<p>Because he felt like it, Mr. lazy knelt down and prayed, he prayed for his wife, anything for her, and he prayed for his neighbour who was always stressed and depressed and living a life too fast for her body.</p>
<p>A Priest came in wearing a beautiful white gown, and he smiled and talked to them about the Bible. It was friendly and non-judgmental. Then a few more people came in from behind them, they were kind people. They had all gathered to learn the bible.</p>
<p>The thieves were touhed by the kindness of everyone around them. But it was too late, they had already said that they were going to do this. Mr. Lazy looked around the Church once more, he got up from his position of prayer and thanked the Priest, then he walked backwards out of the Church. Mr. Chatterbox and Mr. Purple followed close behind him. Mr. Dangerwas crying at the altar, but then when he looked up his tears had already dried up. He had cried with no sound, what betrayed him was the jerky movements in his shoulders as he was down. When he was up, he walked out quietly and reverently.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was last, he looked around, and looked around some more. And left.The heist was starting. This was one more evidence of their change in the world and of what they were leaving behind.</p>
<p>Outside the huge church doors they gathered, they were all smoking, the tips of their cigarettes were like street lamps.</p>
<p>Before they knew it they had become so close, they all came here because Mr. Angry wanted them to. He called them over. They didn't know anything about his history or background or job, or parents, or nationality, or what he studied, or who he had loved, or what his vulnerabilities are. Or even his name, or what to say to make him look. Or what to say to make him angry. But they were still close because of this one job.</p>
<p>And here Mr. Lazy, instead of thinking about his wife, was staring at the perfect woman in front of him. She was smoking tiredly, impervious to his gaze, completely above him in any level. He didn't know anything about her. He wanted to know more. Mr. Purple was a mysterious woman.</p>
<p>He wished to know her name, her real name. The sweet name that her loved ones called her. It was too cruel for him not to be able to call her by her real name. The name that made butterflies flap their wings and babies cry. The slim sound that turned the world into one big cushion where the fall stopped hurting.</p>
<p>She looked down at her leg, it was a leg completely smooth like butter. Then there was a rough cotton patch stuck all around the middle, with heavy injury tape keeping it there. It flashed out from the side of her dress. Mr. Lazy wanted to know what this sign of imperfection was. </p>
<p>“You're always so perfect Mr. Purple” Mr. Danger said.”I'm impressed because your'e so perfect, so how did you get that scar on you?”</p>
<p>“Oh this?” she loked down and tilted her leg out. It looked like the neck of a swan.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy looked at her and knew the reason why, she didn't need to say it, he knew. “I know” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple had opened her mouth to speak her answer, even her tongue was prepared. But she stopped. “What is it?” She asked Mr. Lazy. She talke dto him directly like she knew him well, and the intimacy burned in him. It had been so long since he felt this excitement at testing a woman and getting attention from her.</p>
<p>“It's because you were frolicking with someone. And by frolicking I mean sex. And by someone I mean a guy”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?” Mr. Purple said. She was more surprised than anything. “Why does Mr. Lazy say this?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy knew it was an unreasonable assumption to make, but he was jealous, and his crush for her was growing and growing beyond his control. He couldn't tell anyone because he had a wife at home, and he had already promised her he would never cheat, that he would never even glance at another women. He rememebred telling her that there were all the women in the world, and then  there was her. She was incomparable. </p>
<p>He was already cheating with his eyes, he looked all over her body, her slim legs, and pictured what was underneath the bra, he saw the white straps peeking out like innocent little thingies. And her black top was squeezing around her juicy figure. He wanted to grab her and tell her he loved her. He wanted to see her out of control and wheezing in pleasure under him. He wanted to wipe the arroagnce off her face and replace it with a subservient rectitude.</p>
<p>But he shook the thoughts out of his head, hewasn't going to go any further than this. The rest of the night he tried hard not to look at her at all. Not to listen to her sweet voice, her subtle intelligence, her quirky smiles and laughter at things that weren't funny. And her tiny toes when she shook off her shoes and sat next to the river. He wanted to go and sit beside her and ask her about her life, how she felt about the things that were happening to her. </p>
<p>But he sat there silently.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple got up and, holding her shoes in her left hand, looked down at herself. She brushed off the stray grass that had settled on her being, and stuck to the cotton hem of her shirt. Her hair swayed like a piece of origami. She looked back to see where everyone was, they were still sitting at the river. Without a word she left them. She walked past the motels, there were strings fo them in a line, she had been contracted to paint them the diverse colors. The one in front was half orange on top and the bottom was light green. The next was also different, when they lined up they looked like a colourful wardrobe. She walked past a lady she didn't know, who was slim and glancing up at the motels like they were a museum display. She had long straight hair and walked with an air of educational guessing about her.</p>
<p>Thie woman was Angela, and we follow her because of a breeze that has blown a bit strongly. A smell of nice perfume emanated off her figure like the sight of beloved parents for a lost child. Angela walked down the street gently, each step tracing a history of steps taken by the beautiful ones. She overheard a conversation that was happening in front of her. She found what they were saying was familiar to what she thought about sometimes, and found comfort in strangers being similar to her. They weren't so far away after all. The voices sounded like vague echoes on a lost mountainside that a traveller had been facing for many days already.</p>
<p>“There is no betterment, there is no way of saving a dying world, it's best to run out while you can.”</p>
<p>“The easiest way of saving the world...”</p>
<p>“You don't want the easiest...that's a lazy way out”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I mean the easiest as in the simplest and best way to, the msot efficient way. You dont' need a superhero with a special unique superpower, we have dictators for that already. And it doesn't have to be the hardest way”</p>
<p>“I didn't ask you about superhero's why are you telling me about superheroes”</p>
<p>“If most of the world's population disappeared and went missing without a trace, all ties were broken off, we would have a better chance of starting anew”</p>
<p>“That's stupid, that's not a world harmony worth working towards”</p>
<p>“I have too much invested in it already” she said. “And it is true, I'd been investing in him since I met him. He was supposed to grow and grow and take me with him, but instead somewhere in the process I had been dismissed, and he had even stopped growing. It's like I was watering a plant, and gave it so much water that now it was a lake with nothing there.”</p>
<p>“I know that feeling, it's like trying to tame a wild bull that just runs too fast straight past you, to the drumbeat of something much greater than you can manage. That's something I think about your relationship”</p>
<p>“That's a really perceptive way of putting it. You must be really unique to think of that. The drumbeat is the clapping of the vain and shallow in the world cheering me on.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you're lonely”</p>
<p>These were two voices Angela heard on the street, she would probably never hear them again. She didn't have to go further than this for her answers. They were two voices talking about their personal philosophies and how to heal the world. They were walking beside the river next to a hotel so isolated and far away from the world. Angela went home and while boiling water and preparing some miso soup with dried seaweed and carrots; with a dirty fork and a blunt knife, and pots that aren't smooth and always shuffling about discontently, she thought about what they had said for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The nature never knew these things were around it. And the people don't know either.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-two-i-love-him">thirty two: “I love him”</h3>
<p>And where was Mr. Melancholy did you ask? Meanwhile William was managing his assets with business meetings.</p>
<p>He sat facing Charlotte on the grass behind his room. He had her arms around his waist, and she had his arms on her shoulders, they shared each others gaze. “I support you with all of my heart” she said, “But I don't want to support you if you're not going to remember me, or care about me, I won't invest in that”</p>
<p>He thought about it inside, on the surface he was unchanged and in love. He knew that the people kindest to him were those who had things invested in him. And they needed kindness and confirmation when they least deserved it. His investors watched over him carefully, because they saw something worth investing in him, a part of themselves stored in him, they found value in diferent aspects of his life. Charlotte valued his emotions and smile, and Black valued his skills and smile, everyone valued something in him.</p>
<p>Last night William listened to the DJ who had come to the bar and performed, then he felt like he wanted to be a musician and wished he knew the basics of that. He could do all sorts of things with it, he wanted to perform in front of a cheering crowd with difficult musical riffs. But he quieted his soul down.</p>
<p>Now when he saw Charlotte he wasn't in love with her anymore. Two minutes ago he was, but now he wasn't. These changes fleeted through him obliviously to her.</p>
<p>“I realize I've had pride” she said.</p>
<p>“We all have pride” William said, “I know it so well” He felt comfortable talking to Charlotte about these things, he felt her respect, and he respected her as well.</p>
<p>“William, I felt pride in knowing what you really thought, you always tell me your sincere emotions and I felt proud to know that I was your confidante and knew things about you no one else knew. I know it's selfish but it's how I felt okay? It was a secret side of you that only I knew....or so I thought...”</p>
<p>She wanted him to say something, so he hugged her, wrapping those hands on her shoulders around her neck like a tame Anaconda. It was enough, it did what it was supposed to, and Charlotte carried on.</p>
<p>“Until it turned out that....everyone knew about it. You're close with a lot of girls as well” she said. “I thought I was in the loop with your true thoughts and they were exclusively mine to keep safe, but you don't think so?” Now she was really demanding an answer. She gripped his waist like an apple she was going to bite into.</p>
<p>“Were the things you told me even true?” she said. “How many women are in your life?” William didn't answer and she took that as an answer. She got up away from the grass and William's hands around her waist. As she got up a first string of tears fell to the grass. The grass thought it was rain and absorbed it like food. She brushed the place where her tears had fell with her naked foot, and she wiped her eyes with a strand of hair. “You need to know that sometimes your actions affect those people around you” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded and watched her. He still had his arms out, and she could go back in to them any time, and things could be normal. But she stayed strong and stayed away, if she didn't do this then nothing would change. And change was more important than anything that lasted forever.</p>
<p>Charlotte left William there and walked to her friend who she could talk to right now. She found her in her room. This was an antisocial woman called Johanna. But she wanted to becalled Pernessies by everyone. She lived in one of the older rooms, because she had been here for a long time. And whenever Charlotte came here it was because she was facing a crisis. She neevr imagined that breaking up with William would affect her this much, usually breaking up with boyfriends was as easy as drinking a cup of water or having dinner with the family, or doing homework, or wiping your ass on the toilet. It wasn't supposed to make her cry.</p>
<p>“Pernessies” she knocked on the door three times. She heard shuffling inside and a woman opened the door, she had a wrinkle on her cheek, it was the forty year old wrinkle, that people got when they hit forty. On her neck were the strands of thirty and twenty. </p>
<p>“What is it this time love?” Pernessies immediately stepped aside and let the emotional mess in. Charlotte walked over boxes and shelved lying on the floor and balanced herself over to the bed, then she collapsed in it and let go.</p>
<p>The last time these two had met, someone had died. It was about six months ago as far as Pernessies could recall. She didn't meet Charlotte often, but whenever they met it flowed naturally. Pernessies was a janitor for public areas, she saw Charlotte at reception every so often. And sometimes they would destress from work in the cubicles together, because those were the only places without eyes in the hotel watching them. </p>
<p>“The man I love turned out to be a huge bad criminal” Charlotte said, “I'm sorry to dump this on you every time” Charlotte looked around and saw knitting remains, a sewing needle, designs on paper, and a phone sitting on the bed. She had interrupted Pernessies while she was designing and sewing something. “I feel so bad, did I stop you from doing your knitting?”</p>
<p>“Don't worry” Pernessies said. “Just tell me what you need to, we'll get through this together”</p>
<p>Her friend Pernessies always saw the best of people and the good things that people were doing. She saw people as noble and worthy and able to accomplish a lot, if they used their talents and passions and nurtured them in the right way with a positive attitude.</p>
<p>The last time she saw Charlotte was over something completely different, now suddenly Charlotte was with her about a man who she loved who was also a criminal and had never actually loved her back. So she felt used and betrayed and devalued. It was so sudden. The last time Charlotte would never imagine this. Pernessies knew by now that you never knew what was around the corner, peoples' lives changed all the time. And she liked to watch the change and be involved in it. It made her feel alive. It was her way of touching the world.</p>
<p>So Charlotte asks Johanna/Pernessies about this guy she liked. She just wanted to be heard and not judged on anything, she wanted someone to understand what she was going through.</p>
<p>“Well, I don't know anything about him, who is it?” Pernessies said.</p>
<p>Charlotte couldn't tell, she felt bad coming to Pernessies to destress, then ignoring her for the rest of the year. She felt bad because she couldn't tell Johanna who the man was, or what their passions were. “I can explain about him” she said, “I can't tell you who it is for confidentiality reasons, but he is very passionate and caring, and he's also in love with me, I think”</p>
<p>“Then what's the problem?”</p>
<p>“The problem...” Charlotte swung around on the bed, seeing more boxes piled up in front of her and a CD case that was open off a computer. “The problem is that he is also in love with a lot of other women, he's polygamous”</p>
<p>“So what are you asking? Do you know what you're trying to say, or are you just wasting more of my time?” Pernessies meant that in a friendly way, and Charlotte felt pleased that she had a friend who could talk to her in this way and she wouldn't feel offended.</p>
<p>“Okay, about his criminal life” Pernessies said, “You need to ask him which he likes more, his passion and his drive in life, or you. You need to know that before you can compare the two of them.”</p>
<p>Pernessies thought Charlotte didn't know what her man's passion was because he hadn't told her. But Charlotte felt that she couldn't tell Pernessies what William's passion was. She realized she couldn't tell, it must be because she loved him, William. She had never felt this strongly about anyone.</p>
<p>“You can't tell me?” Pernessies said, “Do you know what it is? It's what's most important for the character of a man.”</p>
<p>“I think I know it” Charlotte said, “It's very important to him, and I don't think I would compare to him at all.”</p>
<p>“I don't know what the passion is” Pernessies sorted out her sewing goods. “For each man it's different, but it's sort of like a password into their life, a visa to enter their country, an ID to identify them, and I only know what you have told me, that it's very important to him. Would you still exist in that passion of his, once he starts living his life?”</p>
<p>Now William was sort fo doing nothing, but in the future, she had no idea what he would be doing, and she wasn't sure if he would have space for her. He hardly had space for her now.</p>
<p>For some reason Charlotte felt so sad. Maybe it was because she couldn't tell Pernessies. Maybe because this romance with a sketchy man showed her just how far from reality she had detached. Her friends saw her and couldn't believe her anymore.</p>
<p>“Charlotte, if you're feeling sad, don't feel sad, I know you say a lot of unrealistic things, and don't take this the wrong way, but you've always been like that a little dreamy and impractical, but I mean it in a good way, not many people are like that anymore. You're looking for a guy who is a billionaire, or the next man who will show you so much kinendess and consideration. Or a guy who is a director of big movies that you watch on your screen at home, or someone who can make music that will make you dance all night. You're full of unrealistic ideas Charlotte. But that's why I enjoy talking to you and listening to you. For you, lovers are everywhere, if you throw a stone from the sky it will hit five lovers for Charlotte on the way down.” Pernessies said</p>
<p>Charlotte looked down at the floor, she was being flattered, this shouldn't be happening to her. “I dont' see it myself, you're saying too many good things about me. I'm nothing like what you make me out to be” she said. “My expectations change every day based on what I see in the world, I'm really immature and like a kid,  I always complain about small things”</p>
<p>“But that's also the most beautiful kind of dreamer” That brought Charlotte down a lot.</p>
<p>Pernessies gave her final review, “To be honest, I'm shocked that from the likes of what you've told me, you know almost nothing about this guy; his future aspirations and core morals, he seems to be lying to you, and you're infatuated with him. Look Charlotte, you hardly know him, and even whether or not he likes you. Whetehr you're a dreamer or not, look, these are the basic steps to a relationship, and everyone entering a relationship needs to walk through these steps one way or another.</p>
<p>Charlotte was amazed by her friend once again. She needed to say nothing and withold everything, and her friend would understand her.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the concerned Charlotte met Annalise. Both women were going through similar things in their lives. And both women, despite savouring the same goods, harbored almost no ill intentions for one another.</p>
<p>Charlotte knew that Annalise was involved in the heist. She was an observant woman. When the time was right, she captured Annalise in one of the cubicles, the camera's weren't upon them and nothing was recorded, so she asked Annalise about Daniel, their boss.</p>
<p>At first Annalise was shocked that Charlotte knew about the heist, then she was shocked that Charlotte knew so much about the heist. Then she realized why, William.</p>
<p>“What exactly is going on here?” Charlotte said.</p>
<p>“You know you're not supposed to know about this?” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“I know, I received a death threat from you boss already” Charlotte said, and the way she said it made her sound so helpless and desperate. Charlotte was left out and wanted to know more about the man she cared about. If anything, Annalise should understand her feelings, she was in the heist with William, and didn't have to be so curious.</p>
<p>“I just want to know, I feel like there's a lot happening that I'm not given the notes to, like missing many lectures and then having to attend an upcoming exam.”</p>
<p>Annalise sighed, what she was about to say wasn't confidential, it was just her opinions anyway, and who cared about her opinions? “About Daniel” she said, “He's our boss, I can't tell you about the heist, for reasons I hope you will understand, but I can talk a little about our boss.”</p>
<p>Charlotte nodded in approval and gratitude. She shifted her weight on the toilet bowl. Annalsie puleld some toilet paper out of habit, thenr ealized, and chucked it in her pocket, then realized, and threw it onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Daniel wants to make his mark on the world, a big mark, I think” Annalise said, “And because making a big and good mark is too difficult, he wants to make a big and bad mark, I think.”</p>
<p>For the first time Annalise wasn't yelling at someone to do something, she wasn't complaining about someone, she was actually thinking, and this impressed herself, she felt better. Everyone said something different about Daniel. But they all said the same thing, that they respected him.</p>
<p>“But I thought you said he was doing good” Charlotte said. She had such hopeful eyes that Annalise didn't wish to destroy them.</p>
<p>“We're stealing things Charlotte, is that ever any good?”</p>
<p>“But you're stealing for the right reasons right? Like Robin Hood?”</p>
<p>Annalsie felt jealousy tingering up in her, she hadn't wanted to feel this way, the fear of this emotion had kept her avoiding Charlotte up until now. But the jealousy was because she was amazed at Charlotte's dedication to William. She was so desperate to believe that William was doing good that she would lie to herself to believe it. Annalise could never be so self sacrificial over another person.</p>
<p>“Maybe” she said, “But I feel that this man's passion is something dirty and shouldn't be relased into the world. I only regret that I hadn't noticed it sooner. In person he's a great man, he's friendly and chivalrous, but his real presence is his passion. And that is something that should be avoided, do you get what I mean?”</p>
<p>“Kind of” Charlotte nodded, “Maybe not”</p>
<p>“Whatever, work with that”</p>
<p>Charlotte got up, she unlocked the cubicle, but before she could leave Annalise held her back with one lone arm.</p>
<p>“What?” She looked over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Charlotte, can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“Yeah” Charlotte washed her hands, pumping soap onto them madly.</p>
<p>“Why aren't we closer friends? I feel like we're really similar” </p>
<p>“We are friends though?” Charlotte said.</p>
<p>“True” Annalise went beside her and pumped soap onto her hands madly, sinking them in between her fingernails.</p>
<p>Charlotte dried her hands with the air dryer, she flipped them over like pancakes </p>
<p>“Can I ask you something else?” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“Go ahead”</p>
<p>“Do you love him?”</p>
<p>The dryer stopped, “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Because I love him” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“Maybe that's why we're not closer friends?” Charlotte said. She stood in front of the door handle. </p>
<p>“Yes, I love him” The door swung shut behind her.</p>
<p>The two of them were at war with who could bash out stronger emotions and right now they were at a standstill. Because no emotion was stronger than the L word</p>
<p>Charlotte walked home from the bathroom, with the first cigarette she was wondering about what Annalise said.</p>
<p>The second cigarette was wondering about how Annalise knew so much about Daniel, were they together?</p>
<p>The third cigarette was from a new pack that she brought out specifically for this occasion, and it was for learning all about new things. With it she wonders about how much she really liked William, if he had never come and apepared in her life, then would she like someone else around here the same way as she liked him? Did that mean that she had a choice who she likes?</p>
<p>And then as the cigarette breathes its final puff of nicotine, she wonders if she can still think clearly without these cigarettes prompting her to.</p>
<p>Because she was going to quit now, it was the last time she's going to have this taste. She would throw the packet into the river and let it float down and someone else pick it up. She felt almost as if she had to recommend it to someone else, or the tobacco gods wouldn't be happy with her and elt her loose.</p>
<p>Then she swore, she tried to light another one up but it was too windy. This whole place was windy nonsense, it was too windy for smokers, smokers shouldn't live here.</p>
<p>On that windy night Annalise heard a knock at her room. She expected William, but opened the door to see Charlotte. Her hair was a mess all around her, and her shirt had specks of dirt and grass and twigs. </p>
<p>She walked into Annalise's room with resolve. With the air of a rival. “William loves me” Charlotte pretended, she actually had no idea what he thought of her, but right now he loved her. “And I know he loves you too” Charlotte pointed her finger, it was difficult for her to say this, and Annalsie couldn't help grinning when her rival acknowledged her man loved her. It was the biggest ego boost. </p>
<p>“I know I have to share him” Charlotte said. “And I thought about it, and I'm still fine with that. I've got enough dignity and strength, other women have told me, and will continue to tell me that I shouldn't stoop so low for a man, but I know who I am and what I want, I know what my passion is, and I like this man, so I will do it. And maybe, someday, I can cheat on him as well, and we will be evensies.” she said, “But for now, I'm satisfied with where I'm standing, and today I just came over to respectfully but firmly tell you that I'm not going to back down, I'm going to go for William as well”</p>
<p>Now the two girls were looking each other dead in the eye, like looking at a computer screen for too long. Then Charlotte, with her head raised, walked out of the room and clsoed the door behind her quietly.</p>
<p>Annalise sat down, her energy drained from her. She had heard the extraordinary statement, a war declaration had never been so eloquently delivered, and yet, she heard the extraordinary amount of pain in Charlotte's voice, like every word was a breath after a long swim. But she knew that Charlotte didn't want to be reminded of it, Charlotte was living with the pain, she didn't need someone to tell her that she had it.</p>
<p>And it was with great respect that two enemies became friends that day.</p>
<p>But to the world at large nothing had changed.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-three-professional-environment">thirty three: 'Professional Environment'</h3>
<p>William was back in his job. It was a 'Professional Environment', he was reminded by the desks they kept clean, the folders he kept neat and tidy and in place, and the never ending flow of customers who turned up at the counter asking the same questions, which he answered in the same way. After repeating it twenty times he was getting fed up. Each customer came up to him in the same way and said the same things.</p>
<p>William felt like protesting, but he couldn't. Because he had nothing to stand on. He didn't care about work, that was true, but then what did he care about? Did he care about anything of value at all? He cared about girls, but when he was given the time for them, he refused. He didn't care about his appearance, but when people made him dress differently in a uniform, he was full of complaints and was extremely upset. In short, he didn't care about what anyone thought of him, because he was too stuck up. He didn't care about his appearance, he didn't want anyone to tell him to do anything, he was too proud. And that made him feel ashamed.</p>
<p>And when he was proud he would do and say anything and justify it himself. But when he wasn't proud, he regretted it. His emotions weren't lasting, and his interest in things wavered. So as he stood there at the counter greeting customers and organziing papers, and sorting through files for tomorrow, he wondered who was he?</p>
<p>Maybe that was why he needed to steal, to do anything to enforce some kind of extreme character, so he could try and capture something he was missing, a perosn with no character didn't exist, they were a shaodw. And so a kleptomaniacal impulse to seize anything that was in reach and stash it. Like a child in a cnady store who was oevrhwlemed by the cchoices and wanted to try everything.</p>
<p>The boss glided up to him smoothly and calculated, with his back straight and a 20 degree smile. As he talked to his boss, Annalise watched him from the counter, she admired how he talked eloquently and smoothly and started to like him more.</p>
<p>William gave Black an update on what kind of situation was in the store. He appreciated the responsibility and trust he was given, but he was dissatisfied, and he didn't know why. </p>
<p>“Really?” Black said, Suddenly he made a drastic decision based on William's feedback. Black kept sending emails telling employees new updates that they all had to sign in compliancy. And it was written in fine print, if they signed it and made a mistake, then they were liable to be punished for it. But everyone had to sign it. Even when they hardly knew what they were signing.</p>
<p>Black finished discussing he moved away and sat at his desk at the very back, isolated from the happenings of the store and making phone calls to various persons. The only time he came to the front was to inspect and find faults in the things employees were doing. Yet the manager knew nothing about the workplace and the situation of it, he always made mistakes up front. William felt like that wasn't a manager, the only thing a manager needed to manage was the respect he earned from his employees, and then work and discuss and consult with them on how to do things. Not making them sign things that they were liable to be punished for.</p>
<p>William was telling Charlotte about the job, and she understood everything, once was enough, she also had a boss, he was more popular, but more or less the same deal. People left the job because they didn't like their boss.</p>
<p>They had a party one time, a staff party for a special occasion in the hotel. William looked over all of his investments, his loved ones looked more real when they were talking to each other. Charlotte was smiling and grinning at someone she worked with, he saw Annalise, he saw his supervisors talking to each other, Elizabeth and Jeena, Jeena was tucked in closely with her husband, who was a large quiet man. He was the kind of man who was so large and soft that he could become a bed. He saw other pretty girls he wanted to get with. He saw Jason idling on the side with his wife. He saw Gerry A.K.A. Mr. Danger, sitting with a bunch of women and moving his hands as he described something, they laughed. He saw one of the players sliding back and forth in between women. He saw everyone but Mr. Purple, she really wasn't involved with the hotel. William had almost all of the girls' numbers in his phone, and they texted him secretly. So which life was real, this one, or that one? If everyone had secrets, did it really make sense? Was it possible to live life without secrets of these sorts that manipulate and effect others? William sat in the corner with his friend, they both sipped especially fizzy sprites, he said this to his friend, the friend was disinterested and commented how this girl was hot, that girl had hot boobs, that other one should wear shorter shorts, that girl who was laughing should laugh a bit quieter, but she had a small and bouncy ass. He was judging every girl like a connoseuir. William started to feel sorry for these girls, they had to live their lives within the aceptance of fussy men like him who judged the goods everywhere they went.</p>
<p>A group of the guys gathered in this corner, then they started talking, the music wasn't too loud. After about thirty minutes of talking, William told them about one of his women. Talking about her to them made her seem more realistic and lovely. After about thirty minutes of talking about her to others, that was it, no one else really knew much more or what to say to comfort him, because it looked like he needed comfort. His relationship with her, itself then, lasted for a long thirty minutes, he, like everyone else here was constantly bouncing around.</p>
<p>What was evidence for some people was just a word for another, and it was an epiphany for another. Evidence was determined by context. One guy was talking about this, then William looked up and saw a girl he was liking more and more. She was quiet but extremely respectful to everyone and kind. She sometimes told him about her love life, because they werebeginning to get close enough to do so.</p>
<p>The bosses were huddled in the corner like sea lions watching for prey. They talked quietly over mild drinks in their right hands. Their suits were impeccable and their belts were as shiny as a bald head. Their shirts were ironed and their pants had vertical stripes that were in fashion in the village.</p>
<p>William saw the GM, he felt like going over to talk about serious business details. The GM looked bored and looked around his employees. There was no woman next to him, and William wondered if there ever was. He was a very knowledgeable man it seemed. </p>
<p>The bosses didn't fit in with everyone drinking and partying their minds off. He said a few words in a quick speech, the words were there for show, the speech was there just to remind everyone that he was the boss and yes, he really did exist, and yes, he did wear a suit. After the speech, he left to go home and slept early to prepare for work the next day. He turned a blind ear and a blind eye to all the people who were drinking. </p>
<p>Before he left, he scoured through the crowd again, everyone was off their rocker and dancing and out of their minds, but within it he saw a pair of eyes looking back a thim like a possum struck by a bright light in a tree. The eyes belonged to one of the employees who was quiet but respectful, he hadn't been here very long. He was the only one who wasn't drunk, everyone around him was screaming and laughing, but this employee was staring back at him stoicly and calmly, as if he understood a lot more than he was supposed to. The GM knew that if he went to talk to this man, the conversation would make a lot of sense and flow, it would be sober. He was remarked.</p>
<p>Later through the night, William didn't realize it, but it was very important.He would remember it for a long time to come, just because this would be the last time he saw the GM, the first man he stole from.</p>
<p>The party really started to kick in. William was sitting there, the dancing was becoming more uncoordinated as people took the next step away from sobreity. Here everyone was equal, there were no more bosses, everyone had a licence to say whatever was on their mind.A woman came back from the dancing, she sat next to him. It was Jeena, his supervisor.
She was a Pakistani woman who felt a bit detached from her nation. She didn't associate herself with her own culture. In the store she regularly insulted the customers from her own country, but oved the ones from her hometown. They always wanted discounts on everything and had to nag about everything, it sounded rascist to say so, but it was true. They persistently wanted discounts on everything. </p>
<p>“Are you enjoying tonight?” Jeena said. There was no flush of alcohol on her cheeks, no sense of a loss of reality. “How come you're not dancing?”</p>
<p>William questioned whether she was here to talk to him, or if she was still the supervisor and comforting him because he was sitting alone.</p>
<p>“Let's talk” she said. “Let's just talk okay? I've heard a lot about you so lets talk”  She leaned in to ask him questions, but she stopped and raised her hand. It was dark around the table and she motioned for him to move next to her. “The music's too loud, I can't hear you” She was shaking her head. He moved in closer between all of them.</p>
<p>“I have to leave soon” she said when he moved to sit next to her. Then, she started talking about herself. “I came here, to this hotel to be with my husband” she grinned, “Funny right?”</p>
<p>“It's funny” William was not amused. He wondered why she suddenly started speaking.</p>
<p>“I'm qualified back home, and I have certificates from top companies, I went to our best University, it's even better than the top university in your country” she raised her finger, to show No.1.William wanted to remind her that he wasn't from this country either, but he understood what she meant. That her country was far away, and she ahd done so much but felt underappreciated here.</p>
<p>“Now” she said, leaning over to put her mouth in his ear, “I'm a supervisor in a store, I'm the boss of little pigs like you” he turned his head and saw her pointing at him again. “It's funny right?”</p>
<p>“Very funny” Now William was amused.</p>
<p>The next day in the store he was sitting there bored. A difficult customer had just come to them, they had been nagging about a price for a long time, and when he decided to them a service they just walked away with disinterest. His colleague wanted to complain about it, but she was afraid Jeena would be upset, because they were from the same country.</p>
<p>“Don't look at me, as if I'm offended, it's okay, I don't have a home” Jeena said. “I acknowledge that my people are rude, I'm also bearing the brunt of it, but I tell you, my husband and I are not like that. We never ask for discounts, we always pay what's due, it's out of a sense of duly respect that we have, and everyone should have.”</p>
<p>After the speech she made William go and clean something in the store that was already clean. Was she passive aggressive with a nasty streak of vengeance?</p>
<p>Later he asked her, because he sensed something in her that wasn't right. Jeena talked normally, was excellent at her job, and did everything she was supposed to, but William felt like something was seriously wrong with her. He couldn't tell how or why he felt this way, it was just something when he saw her. </p>
<p>She came over and sat down beside William just before work finished, not knowing that he was so popular with Charlotte and Annalise already. She asked him what he felt about the job, and if he was happy here. And if he was ever lonely, or ever in need of help, he should ask her. They sat on the seats in the storeroom which were without cameras. She was practically covering him with her body and arms. Like a big bear looking over a small bear</p>
<p>Then she leaned over and suddenly kissed him. He didn't respond and she watched him. He tried to kiss her back but she refused, “You don't like it right?”</p>
<p>Then he kissed her and let go, and she wanted more. She looked back at him on the pitiful stool. </p>
<p>“You said I can ask you anytime, well I've got a question” he said.</p>
<p>“Go ahead”</p>
<p>“Do girls like kissing?” he said.</p>
<p>Jeena gave a complicated answer, because she always said a lot when she was nervous, also when she was thinking hard about something; which was probably nervousness as well. “Maybe, hmm, maybe”</p>
<p>It didn't matter to William, “How about Jeena, do you enjoy it?” He kissed her, and though it was taboo, she was a bit older and married, she felt the same. Maybe their maturity levels were the same. At that moment Jeena felt like she knew exactly what this young man was thinking, and he felt like he knew exactly what this older woman was thinking.</p>
<p>They both did it in the storeroom, he took her top off with one swoop. He felt guilty because he was doing this a lot recently with many different women and it wasn't a big deal for him, but she was really excited, “This is so bad, I'm not supposed to do it, I'm married.” she giggled and held up her ringfinger with a diamond ring on it. She started crying, then giggling. She was crazy, and he didn't care, he just needed to let go and live life. It was the culture of You Only Live Once. </p>
<p>She said it was such a beautiful thing, as he kneaded her breasts like he was making bread. “YOLO, is that what the young people these days are saying? I really want to be a part of the youth, makes me feel young and proud to be able to associate with them, and also relates me to my past more. I feel like I've come to this foreign country and been unable to do much.” </p>
<p>William nodded and licked her nipple, his thumb played with her other nipple, it stuck out like a button, and everytime he touched it she moaned, like one of those soft toys that you pressed and it made a sound. No matter how many years you lived, your buttons were the same.</p>
<p>William looked up and the colour drained from his face. He had a hard time seeing it through the jungle of bouncing breasts and flexible limbs, but there was a camera looking at them. As he was shoving everything in and out of her.</p>
<p>“There's a camera” he said, “Pointing at us”</p>
<p>“Oh that, don't worry, I've turned it off”</p>
<p>She had thought of it already? “When?”</p>
<p>“Before I walked in this room, this was my intention the whole time”</p>
<p>“Do you sleep around outside of wedlock regularly?”</p>
<p>“Maybe” she laughed, “No, just joking, I don't, yours is the first dick I'm feeling in me apart form my husband's.” That was a turn on and William started moving faster like an animal on steroids.</p>
<p>The next day he arrived at work still feeling guilty. He got to work and Jeena was there already, she had just arrived and was saying bye to her husband, they kissed and he left to go to his work. William went behind the counter and ran his eyes through the emails, there were the usual details, and a new maintenance request. </p>
<p>For a broken camera in the storeroom. William asked Jeena about it, she came over and stood behind him, her breasts pressing against his back. “It turns out the camera was broken, it accidentally fell off” she smiled. She cocked her head, “Isn't that strange, I made sure to file a maintenance request as soon as possible, and they came and fixed it today, so thank goodness it's good as new now.”</p>
<p>This woman who was talking was ferocious, she wouldn't get caught, so she deliberately broke the cameras, later the team came in to fix it, and there was no problem with it, but she wasn't caught. </p>
<p>William looked over all the rest of Jeena's recent emails, there were a lot of maintenance requests. And he wondered how many of them were real, and how many fo them were her having sex with people? He watched her as she sorted through some of the files for the new orders, she stamped the ones that could be approved, and he wondered when he talked to her and she said everything was fine, and gave a long reason, whether that was a lie as well? Coudl she be trusted, or did she like about many other things as well?</p>
<p>She smiled at everyone, as if nothing happened, and she lauged and joked with the customers so naturally, as if nothing happened. To see her like that made him afraid, because she was an excellent performer, no one had any idea what dirty things she had done to him last night. He felt sorry for her husband. </p>
<p>“What are you so quiet today for? Are you okay?” Jeena came up behidn him again, he felt her nipple twisting itself into him, she really had huge breasts. He instantly was brought to life.</p>
<p>“How come you're not quiet?” he said, “You act like nothing happened”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” she was dead serious, there was no smile, no need to act, she was bringing new brochures to stock up, and cleaning the desktop. She was so efficient. “Nothing to change my life has happened”</p>
<p>“What about last night?” She suddenly became more serious, she asked one of their colleagues to take care of the customer, and took him to the side, her breasts seemed to grow larger with every step and bounce around like basketballs. “Look” she turend around when they were out of earshot, and where they were standing was a blind spot between three cameras. “Look, last night was a one off thing, I'm married, I'm a good woman, and I will keep it a secret until I die, and I hope you do the same, don't brag about it to your friends, it's none of their business.” Her tone showed her weakness, she was really afraid now, there was no carefree smile or warmth, she was desperate that he didnt' tell anyone. William felt a power grow in him, he could ruin this woman's whole life and career if he spoke about it. She hadn't shown it at all.</p>
<p>She always respects rules and respects custoemrs, but when one of them talks to her about things, then she tells the other lady off. She has very high morals and won't tolerate rascism and insulting people just because they are of a different culture. “I've got a lot more to lose than you do” she said. As if William had nothing important to lose whatsoever.</p>
<p>After work later, William thought about what she said and felt offended, is she so afraid of him talking about it? It was such a great feeling for both of them. She said she was married, and what did he expect? She couldn't throw her life away for a little fun.
William saw Jeena's husband come to get her after work, and he felt mixed feelings. He was Jealous but he still wanted her to be happy with what she had..</p>
<p>“Who were you talking about?” The woman in his room said, she looked up from his dick, it was soaking like a fountain. She put her mouth around it and sucked like she was drinking a thick milkshake with a straw. She worked on it, he held her hair back and she worked on it like a scupture she was trying to carve, or an icecream on a hot day that kept melting and she had to lick all around to make sure nothing hit the expensive carpet.</p>
<p>This was a crazy woman he met randomly outside, they both glanced at each other and betrayed their intentions. He didn't know her name and he didnt' care. When she sucked him off, William talked about his life. He didnt' ask for it, but this woman was crazy, she preferred this over a coffee someplace with a semi-soothing atmosphere. And he talked about anything that came to his mind, she was good like that, and because he didn't know her he could say anything.</p>
<p>“There was this couple a guy called Daniel told me about, the woman gets so jealous seeing him sleeping with other women, so the next time she's with him she tries to steal him and take him back. So she carved her name into his arm in neat handwriting, so he would only be able to sleep with other women called Naomi. If he wanted to sleep with anyone else he would have to make them change their name to Naomi. But that still wasn't enough for her, she put a security tag on him like an item of clothing, so she would know if he ran away. And he was strange, he was fine with it, he always bragged to others that he was proud to have someone care for him so much. He was more popular than her, so she didn't know anything.”</p>
<p>“But in a strange turn of events she suddenly changed her mind, for a week she asked him about different men, then when she disapepared from his life one weekend she took everything that was his. He saw labels underneath where the things had been, like she was reminding him of all the things she took. He still had her name on his arm.”</p>
<p>“And my girlfriend tells me not to tlak about this story, she doesn't like it”</p>
<p>“Hmm” the woman said, her top was kind of see through and her dark red bra beneath it looked black as well. She had her stomach pierced, and a piercing in her tongue, that he felt on him.  “Who's that, you have a girlfriend?” the woman asked him about the name Annalise.</p>
<p>“It's my owner, my queen, she tells me what I can and can't do?” William said.</p>
<p>The woman looked up from his dick, it was covered in her saliva and she kept having to wipe it off. “Does she let you do this?”</p>
<p>“Probably not” he joked, “She'd probably be really mad”</p>
<p>“Good, I hate the bitch, I hate girlfriends in general” the woman said, and continued. “I also hate queens”</p>
<p>“Is it because they don't have dicks?”</p>
<p>She laughed, “Haha, you wish”</p>
<p>“You're crazy” he said. “I'm crazy” William said, “I don't know how to live my life, or how not to live my life, I've stopped thinking about it now and just walk forward everyday, today is different to tomorrow, everyday contradicts the previous day, and once you swing far enough towards one side on the pendulum, then you swing back to the other side”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you're definitely crazy, like one of those crazy intellectual types who no one understands, and no one gives a fuck about. But you know that's fucking attractive, I adore it”</p>
<p>She kept her clothes on and didn't want to go any further with him.</p>
<p>Their conversation kind of hit a brick wall there and they had nothing much else to talk about. William was sick of this promiscuous woman he hardly knew, and she was sick of him as well. They both smiled and said goodbye. She wiped her mouth in appreciation, and he waved.</p>
<p>Then, a month later, Jeena asked him all sorts of questions, he had no idea, no thoughts of what she was asking about, he didn't know why she was asking, but she was really paranoid that somehow he had told someone, and her husband knew all about it. She kept coming up with these absurd theories as to why he has told others, and what he told them. Then he started to regret it, even the sex wasn't worth it for this. </p>
<p>And they weren't even in a relationship.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-four-samantha">thirty four: Samantha</h3>
<p>There was a girl called Samantha, she had just moved here a week ago and was starting to enjoy her time here. Her nextdoor neighbour was a person who had stayed here for a long time, she was half Black and half White. Her room was messy, belongings were scattered everywhere, her bed was littered with clothes, and her being was lost. She recently received a box of rice crackers from her Grandmother overseas, these were rare goods which could not be purchased in the counter. But this girl was an anxious person and because she accidentally touched the rice cracker with her hand that had touched the floor, she was feeling worried now, that she would have to eat it, but would get sick in doing so. </p>
<p>So she was staring at the rice cracker still, as if it would jump up and take off at any minute if she so much as blinked. She was trying to decide which was greater, her guilt of not eating the ricecracker and dishonoring her family, or the anxiety of eating the rice cracker. </p>
<p>Three rooms over from hers, in one of the odd number rooms. William was lying on his bed also feeling guilty about being involved in a heist, the guilt was so natural that it had become a part of him, he woke up to the beat of guilt in his heart and the reprimands from his conscience. He felt like someone so useless and small like him was taking all of this money from big important people, it wasn't right.</p>
<p>Three rooms back over, her loved one called her on the phone. It rang in her room like a prayer, she answered it and expected him to speak, he did. Everyone had their own loved one, and her loved one told her she was mental for whatever reason,for caring about him so much. </p>
<p>Three rooms back over, William was now standing in front of the mirror with a large bag, and in it were his loved possessions. He was working so hard for so much money, full time. Today he went to the store to buy a few small things and his money was all gone. Then he didn't know what he was working for, what did his sweat buy him but anxiety?</p>
<p>At the bar William met one of the girls he was seeing frequently. She had recently arrived at the hotel to work in the restaurant, she carried plates around all day and polished them. She took dishes down on a notepad and gave it to the chef, relaying messages back and forth. She was the new girl, and Wiliam was the less new boy, but he was a bit more polished.</p>
<p>Samantha was young, younger than all of the other girls put together, and had a reputation of being really nice, She looked slack on the surface, but she worked hard and was honest and reliable. William was hitting on her, then on Charlotte, then on Annalise, then on anyone else who crossed his path. He was friendly to them, but being unfriendly to all the women, he kept cutting back and forth between these women till he himself became confused who was who, and who he had said what to. In the end all of the women held the same importance to him.</p>
<p>After work one time the guys had a small gamble, they were having a game of Ping Pong and William won the game. Samantha's boyfriend. She ran up, past the crowd that had gathered around them, in front of everyone on the stage, and she was hugging and kissing him. She was so proud of him, he actually won, she couldn't believe it. 
“I knew you would always win, but now it actually happens I'm so happy for you” she said, as she hugged him in front of everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>Samantha was talking about this guy to another guy on the sofa somewhere semi-private. “I know  William has a girlfriend, but I'm sure he'll like me more than her, if I just try my best to make him like me.” She was excited about this endavour, and avoided thinking about the damage she was doing. </p>
<p>“Then why aren't you with him now?” She looked so happy when she was talking about him, he wondered what she was doing with him.</p>
<p>“A few days later he called me and told me that he wanted to break up, he wasn't enjoying it any more.” She shook her head, bringing up the memory was disappointing her.</p>
<p>“Oh, I'm Sorry for making you say this” he sipped his coffee and looked at her carefully. He was testing the boundaries of what he could ask, to interest himself, and to have her not cry. He felt like he was hitting the border with his head around now.</p>
<p>“No, it's fine, it's something of the past now, but at the time it was really painful. He got bored of me I guess, or maybe winning made him feel big, and he wanted to throw away his past and move on to bigger things. Now he's dating all these supermodels, he's sleeping around all the time, he won't commit, he's a completely different person.”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly telling me this then?” the guy said. Samantha felt like she was at a counselling session or something, he was completely indulging into her life. And she had only just met him a few minutes ago. </p>
<p>She was surprised by his sudden transformation, “I felt like maybe I had been holding him back, I mean when you see him like this anyone will think that, he's a different person, and I feel like I was holding him back, although I really didn't want to, and I tried to give him all the freedom he needed. But now he's becomes such an amazing person, and I feel guilty for not seeing it in him earlier. I don't trust my own feelings anymore, because they led me into this, I was so in love with him, I thought we were going to get married and raise children together, in a few years. But now I don't think of him like that, and I'm kind of relieved I'm not with him anymore. Feelings are strange, you can't trust them, so I trust other people's opinions more than my own now, my close friends really wish the best for me and support me through everything.”</p>
<p>“I'm telling you this because the other day I saw him, he came into the store and said hi to me, then he waved to me and we went out eating, and as we were walking, I realized the roles had reversed.”</p>
<p>“You were bored?”</p>
<p>She nodded, “Mmm Hmm, this time I didn't see anything to value in him, but I did feel nostalgic of what we once had, more so than ever, having him right here next to me, yet I felt so distant from him. He was the same as he had been, he wasn't playing around, he was virtuous and kind, and respectful of me and my friends, he greeted them kindly. But it was too late, I wasn' t interested anymore, I guess I changed.”</p>
<p>“You say it so easily, like feelings are so easy”</p>
<p>“Sometimes they're the most difficult things” she said, “But after a while they fade away, and then you're bored, and they become the most unpredictable things. My friends tell me to be grateful for everything and have a better attitude to face life, less materialistic maybe, but I'm just trying my best in the social constructs we are in. I'm just a product of my environment after all. So I guess I wasn't interested in him, because I changed now. As I kept thinking about him and missing him and aching to see him, I guess I had changed, maybe it was willingly, to get closer to him, maybe not. But first he changed, then me. We changed at different times, had we changed together, we might still be together and getting along really well.”</p>
<p>“So what if I confess to you now, will that surprise you?” The guy said. Samantha reminded herself that this was a total stranger who was listening to her thoughts, it was actually kind of creepy in a way.</p>
<p>She looked at William briefly, taking in his appearance in a different way, he seemed different now, a lot more approachable. She finally looked back, and they weren't on the sofa's, they were next to the riverside. She looked down at her steps as they continued walking along the river bank. The tourists were taking pictures all around them, “I don't know how I'll feel, I haven't heard it from you, some things you don't know how you feel until they happen, I can speculate all I want beforehand and it might be meaningless” </p>
<p>The riverbank belonged to the tourists, she was speaking a lot today. This man made her speak her heart, and she really valued that of him. The clouds were puffy, it was probably going to rain soon.</p>
<p>“I like you Samantha”</p>
<p>She nodded, like she was satisfied. “That felt good, my heart tensed” She just couldn't stop herself from speaking, this was when she should be silent. Maybe in fifty years she would tell her grandaughters of this moment, then what would she say?</p>
<p>“Then what if I try to kiss you? How will you feel?”</p>
<p>“I don't know...yet” </p>
<p>He stopped her walking with a gentle arm on her waist, he twisted her to face him, all the tourists could see them here. He leaned over with his lips hovering in front of hers like a mosquito, breathing in her air, her nostrils widened in anticipation like a cow, she sensed the international missile coming to breach her boundary. He licked the tip of her nose and she grunted because it was so weird, and so unexpected. Yet a deep heat switched on in her, something that had been given to her by her parents. She went ot the control room and switched on her licence to reproduce file, she started ticking boxes and fiddling with switches.</p>
<p>He leaned over to kiss her. Finally, so that's how it was. The time was 12:34. In ten seconds it was done and his eyes would be different, but she would remember it for years to come.</p>
<p>That night Samantha grinned; she was surprised at how fast guys started to like her, she had barely even tried, was she good looking? She must be, or maybe her character was flawless. She had a faint idea, but she didn't need to think about it. Guys were shallow and fell for her easily all the time, she couldn't take credit for it because they didn't like her they only liked her appearance. If any other girl who looked like her walked in the guys would do the same thing again. </p>
<p>She skipped like a little girl back to her room from the bathroom. She was happy she was with William and that he chose her over his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Charlotte was walking down the riverbank, her legs were tired and she sat among all of the tourists taking pictures and fishing, and taking pictures of themselves fishing. Actually, she was just swinging her feet in the water and letting them cool down. Also, she was enjoying the view, it was one of her few days off and she wanted to enjoy everything she saw because she was allowed to, and she shouldn't need a reason.</p>
<p>She heard a grunt and looked behind her, a couple were walking past, their bodies were joined at the lips, their feet were facing each other, she looked longer and saw William kissing the new girl who worked in the restaurant. There was no description how she felt about it, she could only speculate about it a few days later and understand how she felt. </p>
<p>Annalise was lying in her bed, thinking about how lucky she was, she had a boyfriend now, and he was excellent, he was fit and went to get exercise all the time to give her his six pack, he cared about her, and did all the things she wanted him to do. She pictured what William was doing now, at work and treating customers well. He was so diligent. </p>
<p>In her passion all of her boundaries and guard barriers fell down and she saw the best of William. She ignored Misty's advice to watch out, because William threw away everything, he couldn't commit, and he was trying to do something very bad and illegal.</p>
<p>But after William apologized to her, Annalise only saw the best in him. She trusted he wouldn't cheat because he had promised her. But at the same time she felt so insecure that he was doing things with other women, because he always said one thing and did the opposite. She flet guilty for doubting him. She wished she hadn't fallen for such a low immoral guy, he was slimy jelly that would do anything and was hard to grab. She thought that she could grab him now, now he had apologized. Now he was hers. Now she was going to start changing him.</p>
<p>Back with Samantha, the two made their way to the end fo the riverbank, only hardcore couples progressed this far. A.K.A, they were “special” Then William asked her the next step. If she wanted to go to his room or not. She was already expecting this, and she said she would, if she could talk to him more first.</p>
<p>He said, “I will use your vagina all I want, but I won't talk to you. A vagina doesn't talk back, I wish vagina's weren't stuck to women”</p>
<p>Samantha said “That's a horribly misogynistic comment and you should never say it to a woman.”</p>
<p>“Because you're all hiding this?” William said, “Your anger proves to me how fake you are, why else would you be angry about this?”</p>
<p>Samantha stopped walking and clenched her fists, she was so angry, so angry at him for saying such an unreasonable thing. “Hiding what? You seem to think women are all out there to make you miserable. No, only you're miserable, only you're selfish, so stop bothering women around the world and lying and behaving like you're some honest good guy, you're scum, a knob, a tool, and then blame others around you who care about you, maybe that's why you're so lonely. You're nothing like the honest guys, you wouldn't even compare to their smallest toenail.”</p>
<p>“I'm not lonely” William said, that was all he picked up from her puff of steam.</p>
<p>“From what you're telling me all the time, you are, you're a sad lonely guilty depressed person, that's what I've heard.” she said.</p>
<p>They were at the very end now. No other copules had ventured this far. Now they either turned back or sunk into the river.</p>
<p>William wondered why the conversation with this beautiful woman had turned so sour. She was lovely and he was a gentleman, why did it go this way?</p>
<p>They paused at the river end. Both of them were unsure of where to go next. Then the natural conversation met the river and talked about the first time they met. It was like an old couple who had been togetehr for so long and were not reminiscing their past together.</p>
<p>“I didn't know how I felt about you at the time” Samantha said. Her feet were in the water and dipping it like an spoon in icecream. “But I remember I didn't want to like you.”</p>
<p>“You greeted me properly for the first time, after a long time when I was trying to talk to you” he said. “And we finally had a nice conevrsation”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I remember” Samantha said. </p>
<p>“Yeah, you never talked much, but when we got talking I realized that you knew a lot about me and remembered small details that usual people wouldn't know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah” she said, leaning over onto William's shoulder, like so many other women had done before, on the same T-shirt as well. “I was really curious and interested in you”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and you smiled subtly at me” he said, “It was really subtle, but it was enough for me to notice, and I was moving on from a relationship and was ready for you, that's what I realized”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you were moving on then, and you're moving on now, it's a pattern in your life” she said. “I don't think I can change that” she shook her head.</p>
<p>“Remember when we went to the party?” she said.</p>
<p>“Which party?”</p>
<p>“It was someone's birthday”</p>
<p>“Who's?” </p>
<p>“I don't know, one of the important staff, actually it was like three peoples' birthdays, but they had to celebrate them together as one.”</p>
<p>“My life is just one big blur” he said. “All the parties and non-parties are the same, my sleep time is always different, the days are only numbers in a calendar, work time is only hours to fill, that's my life, one number in a book, a name on a roster, a watse of pen ink.”</p>
<p>“Fuck, I forgot how pessimistic you are”</p>
<p>He laughed, only Samantha would be able to laugh about these things. They were still at the end of the river, both unsure of where to go next. William wanted sex, but he always wanted sex. Samantha was starting to look sexier and exier as the night went along, and as he spoke his mind to her. He didn't know whats he wanted, here listening to his pessimistic thoughts, did she enjoy this? Or did she want to leave? She was expressionless and hard to read.</p>
<p>She looekd over the horizon, then back at him, he saw her breasts silhoutted agaisnt a cloud, her small hips and fit legs. He wanted to lean over and touch her, slip his hands underneath her shorts and clench those butt cheeks. He wanted to lick the inside of her mouth. She looked back at him, it all depended on what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Other people told me a lot about you” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” William tried hard to think about what she was saying. </p>
<p>“That you get turned on easily, and that you're kind of asian but have a big package”</p>
<p>“Why do girls talk about this stuff, it's so inappropriate” he loved it.</p>
<p>“Okay, I've decided, let's go to a party” she said. “Then I'll sleep with you”</p>
<p>William high fived the gods of fertility and followed her. She strung him along really well, she knew his limits and pushed them.</p>
<p>They walked into the bar and all of their colleagues were there celebrating another birthday. Samantha walked in front of him and casually introduced William to the people here. William was surprised at how many people she kenw, she had only been here a week. She really was popular.</p>
<p>He felt like he was in one of those American movies where the new person is introduced to the people at the party and their backgrounds, like a social standing report of the person. </p>
<p>“That's Jeena” she pointed, “You work with her right? She was telling me about you”</p>
<p>“You know her as well?”</p>
<p>She really knew everyone, so eh asked her the more interesting characters. The criminal group. These were his saviours, the ones who were doing things for him and going to change his life, for the worse or for the better, just change. He was a part of them. He saw himself as a criminal with them, and he saw himself as something different and separate from them.</p>
<p>“You see that guy? Do you know him?”</p>
<p>“Daniel?” she said, “Of course, he's a really strange character, but his IQ's off the charts, he's antisocial and doesnt' talk much, one time he completely ignored me like I didn't exist, but actually I don't know anything about him. Only on him I have no information, sometimes he's nice, sometimes he's mean, sometimes he's hardowrking, sometimes he's the laziest. Everyone says different things about him, so I'm not sure.”</p>
<p>William saw how she was trying to see the best of everyone, and he really admired and respected her for that. She was a peacemaker. </p>
<p>“But I don't know if I can ever get with him, I'm not physically attracted.”</p>
<p>“So what” William said, “It's not a big deal to be physically attracted, a relationship is soooo much more than that.” he looked around and pointed at Jason, “How about him?”</p>
<p>“That's Jason” she said, “He's a friendly and nice guy, he's loyally married to Laura. The two of them are the best couple and lucky to have someone in this jungle. If they could get married to each other again, they would. But I think Jason really needs money to support his wife, she's like a hungry car. Apparently she spends a lot of money buying luxurious things, eveyr few days she drives for hours into the city to buy something.”</p>
<p>Samantha was really perceptive, she described everyone, all the people and what they did, their mannerisms, what kind of behaviour they did, and who their friends were. She could describe so much about everyone, even after seeing them for the first time. William was happy to be able to bond with her outside of work. Then he started asking about the girls, and she told him really interesting things about them. Samantha had thought about the depth of their character, and about what should be done to solve some basic problems. She also thought about how to do things in the best interests of everyone. “Promiscuity” she said, “It's so common in our modern day because of the social structures that are in place, there are a lot more strangers than there used to be, there's a lot more privacy between people, and in a way, cities are the most private places because you're hidden in a crowd and are a nobody amongst countless people just like you.” She nodded to herself and stretched her legs in the chair. “That's why I like like this place, I just got here but I know I like it already, because it's so quiet and everyone is friendly.”</p>
<p>It was refreshing for William to ehar someone who was so clearcut in their goals and ambitions, lately the people around him seemed to not know much. But then he felt like Samantha would be perfect for Daniel, they were the clearest people he knew. They were clear crystals.</p>
<p>“That's why everyone gets married later” she said, “Because they're unsure, I mean this is just my opinion, but everyone has more time for work and career, and have more opportunities in life, it also leaves more room for leisure and experimentation. If you're in a supermarket you can shop all you want, but if something starts to expire you need to buy it immediately.”</p>
<p>Samantha impressed him, she had a lot more depths to her than he realized. And to Samantha, William was an interesting guy who listened to her and seemed ot really be interested in what she was saying, not many people would listen.</p>
<p>“I'm amazed by your intelligence” he said.</p>
<p>“I studied this in University, though it seems so far away now...”</p>
<p>“Still, you're so smart. No one here talks like that, everyone's settled and finished. What is someone like you doing here?”</p>
<p>Samantha shrugged and smiled, it was a long smile that captured her cheeks and never let go. “I'm a dreamer” she said, I'm a painter, and nothing is more beautiful than the mountains here”</p>
<p>When she said she painted pictures, he thought she was just another painter. Just because she painted didn't mean she could talk, just because she was his age didn't mean they would be best friends. </p>
<p>“Let me show you” she said, she took his hand and led him out of the party, nine and a half minutes alter they were in her room, and she showed him a wall of her paintings in her room with an arm raised to them. William was astounded there were so many of them, and they were so unique and original, which was a funny word, because nothing was original.</p>
<p>He invited her back home. She was very clumsy, almost as if she were deliberately trying to make herself able to stay at his place without anyone knowing.</p>
<p>Samantha was perceptive and artistic, and she didn't want to be alone anymore. Now she thought she had finally found a man. But as soon as she got to his room, she realized he was a loser and not a nice man at all, then she backed off, she didn't want to be close to him anymore.</p>
<p>Instead of telling him this though, she said something else, “The reason why the world is so quiet is because everyone is thinking during the day. She loves the hotel building form the mountain that is barely lit up, and dark, but the sky is bright and the clouds are dim patches. The further ones are red, the sky is red there, and yellow, but a different part already is missing the sun. The building has its own lights, and insid ethe building there is no passing of time. That's what people have invented, they have taken themselves further away from nature and living in their own efficiency and efficacy”</p>
<p>She reflected on her actions and thought about them afterwards.</p>
<p>A few weeks or a month or a few days later, it was Samantha's last day around town. Despite what she said, she had grown bored of this town and wanted a change, it was too queit and stagnant for her here. She had been having a lot of sex with William and other guys and had felt every cock in the block.</p>
<p>It was her last day today and she was having random thought float around her, she poked at it and tried to sneeze it away. She sat at a cafe, it was in the middle of two tramways, and she found it really interesting to watch everything go past so normally. She was sitting in the corner of the cafe where these two joined together, and she wondered why she was interested in these things.</p>
<p>She was typing in the cafe, waiting for the train. And she saw her reflection looking back at her in the computer screen, against the shiny black keyboard. Walking up the stairs she saw a warped version of herself in the handrails, and a bored version of herself going up the escalator reflected in the shop windows she passed by, cutting in an out. In the elevator she saw a short reflection of herself. </p>
<p>And she felt so useless.</p>
<p>No one had come to say farewell.
She sat in the big lobby on the bench in the corner, wagging her feet like a piano, she looked around the foyer towering over her, at the windows that reflected large portions of light. She saw a guy walk past, he had cheap looking clothes on and was untidy. He looked a bit like the author. She didn't like his appearance, and on that alone she judged him negatively.</p>
<p>Then the guy walked over to the piano and sat at it, peeling the lid open to reveal the skeleton notes. He played the most beautiful piano and the music wafted through the room like a perfume. Now she saw him differently. Then she recognized this guy as the guy who always played piano here. She had no idea where he came from or what he did, but she wondered if this was why William was talking to him, because William was able to see it in him earlier, from the very start. He had seen some ability and some special part of this person that she wasn't able to notice. </p>
<p>From there on, Samantha found herslef thinking about William all the time, as she waited to get on the bus to leave, she was thinking about William nostalgically, even though he was right there in the shop working. It was like a bad food that she was unable to digest and stayed in her stomach, he was so amazing, and she had spent such a magical time with him. They did things together that were so alive, and others just got drunk and talked smack about others. She missed him so much.</p>
<p>The bus arrived and she hopped on, she had thought about this moment, that she wouldn't look back. But she wasn't mature enough, like a little girl, in her school days, she looked back, and wondered if anyone had come to wave goodbye. </p>
<p>Instead of a wave, she saw the mountains, snowy peaked, and glaciers forming on their ridges, beautiful scenery that stretched beyond the expanse of the world.</p>
<p>It was worse, it was too beautiful</p>
<p>It was a fairytale.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-five-lets-talk">thirty five: “Let's Talk”</h3>
<p>When William finished work he thought about Samantha who had left today. He didn't feel anything, but he knew his feelings were unreliable and any time, he could start to feel something.</p>
<p>Charlotte knocked on his door and came in. She learnt to sit in his room without touching anything except William. She wasn't allowed to look through the drawers or the wardrobe, she wasn't allowed to talk about other guys either.</p>
<p>Charlotte didn't want the usual, sit down and fuck and then fuck up and leave. She wanted to move forward with William. And sometimes that meant taking a step back as well. “William, because you asked me not to I haven't touched the things in this room, I haven't asked you many questions although you're a very private man who keeps your public parts private and your private parts public. I don't ask you about the other women in your life, because I'm too weak to hear the truth, and hearing the truth will not change my feelings for you”</p>
<p>“Hmph” he nodded.</p>
<p>“During the day you're living life in the system, working an inconspicuous job the same as everyone else and an oily cog in the system right? But at night you're plotting how to steal everything and destroy everything, you want the destruction of the world. That's what you told me.” She hovered her hand around the room, “And all of this, what's hidden from me are notes to do that right? I can't help but wonder why you feel this way, why can't you just enjoy life, why does you have to go and destroy everything so beautiful. If you stepped into a rose garden you would step and trample over everything. Am I not enough for you?” she said.</p>
<p>William looked at her, she had been listening, not just moaning. “If I have a bomb, I will travel around the world and set it up in the different locations, then one day, when I've had enough I will press the button from my chair where I have grown old and watch the world disappear into ashes.”</p>
<p>“Why” she shook her head, “All of your thinking, what you're doing, it's immoral. I will listen to whatever you tell me William, I'm weak for you. But I don't want to, I wish you were a better person, I don't have the courage to stand up and tell you to do right, or to tell others what you're doing. I'm not strong enough for that. So I decided long ago to remain silent, out of love for you, even though you treat me badly and just use me a lot of the time, every now and then there's a spark of a pretty nice guy. And I enjoy your stories” she said.</p>
<p>He always told her stories of this and that happening, deep stories of how he was like a kid, he hadn't changed since he was a little boy, and he cried and balled his eyes out. Charlotte heard these stories and felt like they were much closer. She knew him so well now, and he was so insightful and amazing to be around, he commented on the world around them with such a unique viewpoint. </p>
<p>“Even when you're a cheater and everyone knows it, I still feel proud to have you next to me when we are walking hand in hand. Even if it's just for the night and I don't know who you'll be kissing  tomorrow.”</p>
<p>William also looked at her and for the first time felt a spark growing, it was a spark that was bigger than his other ones and that made him feel like she was special, more special than all the special girls.</p>
<p>“I've thought about it” she said, “I know you didn't ask, but I want to explain it to you. I'm ready to get married now, I see all the couples and I want to be like them, I'm looking for someone. And I know you're not interested, but I'll keep telling you anyway, because maybe one day you'll change your mind”</p>
<p>“Marriage?” William said, “That's really sudden, I'm still fucking twenty something.”</p>
<p>“But you're a criminal” Charlotte said, “Or you're going to be one, I can't marry someone like that, so I can wait.”</p>
<p>Her fear was that if there was no progress, their relationship wouldn't go anywhere. The longer the time they spent together, the more that they held mutually. Both of them knew that they would have to be pulled apart somehow, it was something that they knew without having to tell each other. The void of conversation topics not to say was growing larger and larger beneath their feet, and the ice of misunderstanding was growing thinner beneath their shoes.</p>
<p>They couldn't understand each other, they could only appreciate the amazingness of the other person. And she is the same, and he was the same. They could only appreciate each other, the moment the other gives the reins to their heart it became meaningless.</p>
<p>“When I told you about the heist” William said, “It was a mistake, I confused you for someone else”</p>
<p>“For whatever reason” Charlotte said, “You told me and I heard it. And it was hard to bear, but I don't regret it, because I feel like we can grow from this together.”</p>
<p>“But I wanted to tell someone” William said, “Because I'm afraid. Why don't you reprimand me? Why don't you get upset at me for telling you this? Isn't it really bad to be stealing all of this money and valuable things from others? From good people as well.”</p>
<p>Then Charlotte shrugged, “I don't know, as long as you're happy with it” she didn't tell him he was bad, she accepted it. </p>
<p>He wanted her to stop him, because he didn't have the power to hit the brakes himself, but she didn't, she thought it was normal. “Just don't get caught” she says. “That would be devastating for me, because we're so happy together right now”</p>
<p>“Where are your morals?” he said. “Will you do anything at all if you're happy with it? Does no one else matters to you, and you can do anything? Besides, what are you doing with her life? Are you just looking for someone to support? Is there anything you want to do yourself that doesn't include me?”</p>
<p>Those were big questions. She wasn't concerned so much about the questions, but that he was directing these questions at her.</p>
<p>“What I'm saying” William said, “Is that I'm not certain that I can share a future with you, I don't trust your judgment”</p>
<p>“You don't trust my judgment? I'm willing to be with you, I'm sacrificing so much, can't you see?”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you about myself” William wanted her to know he wasn't a perfect guy, he wasn't whatever she saw in him. “I want you to learn something about me” he said, “The only reason Im at this job is because I couldn't get anything anywhere, so my mother booked me to come on this job. I'm actually a loser straight out of University, I didn't even graduate because I dropped out and my grades were barely getting through. I'm not a popular womanizer, I'm a geek who has touched women for the first time here. But now I act like a professional or something, like I'm in charge of the world and I know what I'm doing.” Saying all this made him feel vulnerable, but when Charlotte spoke of a future, he felt like he needed her to know the truth about him.</p>
<p>Charlotte was quiet for a long time. The words had finally taken an effect on her, and like William wanted, directly or indirectly, she said it. “You're not anything I envisioned you to be, I feel betrayed” she said. Then she threw him away. She threw him away by walking out of his room and not looking back. She didn't bother closing the door on her way out.</p>
<p>She didn't know why it affected her, but she cried about it through the night, waking up three or four times and reminded of the memory of it. She felt like a part of her had died, and she couldn't get rid of it, it was stuck in her.  </p>
<p>Later the permanent glue dried, and Charlotte went back to William like nothing happened, like she  didn't just throw him out into the trash. She had conveniently forgotten it. She waved and smiled at him as if nothing happened and they were still good. But the next morning he ignored her and acted like the conversation didn't happen. </p>
<p>Charlotte went up to himand asked, “Are you separating work and life with a thick barrier? How come you don't talk?”</p>
<p>“Maybe”</p>
<p>“Maybe? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>He said maybe, but actually it was simple, he had just lost interest in her, he didn't know why either, but it just happened every now and then. He just lost interest in all things, it had nothing to do with a wall or what materials it was made from, it was just to do with him losing interest. There was a huge gap, they kissed and did things in bed, then next moment at work they were just normal friends. He didn't understand it either. What did last night's conversation mean? It meant something different to each of them.</p>
<p>How had their friendship changed.</p>
<p>Charlotte was browsing the store, she was off work and William was working. She turned and asked him what he think of these earrings, she spun the display around, choosing ones she liked. </p>
<p>“Should I buy them?” she said, “What do you think? Do they look good? What do you like on me?”</p>
<p>“I can buy them for you” William said. “There's no need for you to buy your own presents youself”</p>
<p>“Okay, buy them please, and I'll pay you back” She knew that he was already with so many women.</p>
<p>For William the answer used to be easy, but now it was becoming big and meaning a lot. Because everything had become tangled up like a sewing kit that was tinged with oil, it was so serious and full of strong emotions at every turn that were sticky. Now it was holding him back.</p>
<p>Naturally after work Charlotte was waiting for him, and he enjoyed her company, they began discussing all sorts of things in their conversations. About the difference between Western and Asian cultures, the things you could and couldn't say in them. About different shoe sizes, and about hares in the wild. They talked about the randomest things. All because they shared each other. </p>
<p>Charlotte was talking about something ridiculous, about a band she wanted to make that had no singing, and people would just watch them wearing sunglasses. </p>
<p>“I don't know what I'm buying, but please take my money” William said.</p>
<p>“Exactly, it's so funny right?”(NZ humour, be very specific about words that are semi scientific, UNI students humour)</p>
<p>Charlotte remembered how William was really unique, and she hadn't laughed this hard with...anyone ever before. But her memory wasn't very good.</p>
<p>As the night deepened they kept walking around. Charlotte told William about her life, “I'm not very close to my family” she said, “I don't get along with my mother very well, and I think it's affecting my personal relationships, and the relationships I will have in the future” she said.</p>
<p>“Everyone is like that, we're all doing the same things, they're also unstable, but still trying to live their life.” William said. </p>
<p>One weekened they stopped communicating, then when he got back to work she was semi-ignoring him. She acted like they were strangers and was kind to him, but like there was no intimacy. He didn't understand it, why did she feel the need to do this? It was a change that happened overnight. And one time when he told her that there would be no future together, then her passion disappeared.  Was she looking only for someone who would give her a relationship? </p>
<p>William thought about these things as he lay on his bed. But after he saw her at work he saw who she was, she was a person, the same as everyone, just trying her best, and trying to balance her work and her loves. And thinking of him, and her, and hwo they might work  it out.</p>
<p>In their next long talk she told him about her morals, they were sitting on the same bench again and she had just finished a smoke. He waited for it to slowly shorten and disappear. In the darkness only her cigarette was bright, and easily confused for the lights in the sky. “You asked me about my morals, the truth is, I dont have any, so as long as you're happy I'm happy. There's no foundation for me to stand on, anything goes. It's like this. Something that touches you so, then look around and realize that it's not popular with everyone else. And then sometimes something touches me and I look around and see that it's also popular with everyone else. Both of these situations have the same satisfaction level, that's about it. So should I respond by by conforming to it and hiding my true intentions, or should I express my true intentions and not conform to it?”</p>
<p>William overlooked her expression. “Isn't that kind of scary though, for me? How can I commit to someone who has no foundation”</p>
<p>“I do have a foundation, it's just like...earthquake prone.”</p>
<p>“Charlotte, everyone needs to have a moral view, first you have to satisfy yourself.”</p>
<p>She went home and lay on her bed and thought about it. She felt like William was lucky to have someone think about him. About once a month she lay on her bed to just think about things where she had come from, where she was going, and what she was going to do tonight. Then naturally she began to think of William, who was a big part of her life. She saw how he was always such a different person, so many facets of personalities, maybe it was because he was moody. He was an organized criminal, as well as a violent armed robber, but he was also just a simple nice guy to talk to, and really generous sometimes. She began to see how he was variable and not a straightforward man.</p>
<p>She was glad that William had told her about the heist, albeit by accident, she felt included. But she knew he would never mention it again.</p>
<p>She fell asleep with the light on and thinking about William. Later she woke up and thought about him some more. She was his best friend, so she knew how he would act. She knew he would never just leave her, because he's too hard working and too straightforward to do something like that. And she believe in the generosity in his heart.</p>
<p>But then William did it, he defied her, he left her right now, and she felt like he did it partly just to defy her, and partly because he didn't actually care about her that mucj. It pained her to think this, but now that it actually happened she was taken down a notch. </p>
<p>The next time she saw Williamw as at the bench again, he sat there calmly in the enigma of himself, and she spoke. “I am wavering from believeing it and then now believing it. But all of this doesn't affect you at all. I'm living by myself, though I claims to be with you.”</p>
<p>William nodded in understanding, he asked questions in an attempt to understand her. He didn't actually care about what she was saying, he just wanted to know why she was saying it.</p>
<p>“You're selfish, I'm sorry I have to say this, but you're selfish” It was the first anger she had felt, and she didnt' want to say it, but she felt like he should know. “There's a world around you that is affected by your actions, you don't just live alone you know, sometimes you have to think about what you will do.”</p>
<p>“Is that all? I knew that already, so what?”</p>
<p>Then she was shocked, it had taken her so much strength to open her mouth, she had brooded over it for days whether to tell him or not. But it meant nothing to him, and he didn't even care. Just what were his standards, where were his morals? If she had brooded over it for longer, would it have made a difference? “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Your own actions affect others too you know? Maybe we should all just be silent, there's enough talking in the world, if we're all silent then they'll be no problems right?”</p>
<p>“William, boyfriend, lover, whatever.” She stroked her hair straight, “Where do I have to go to try and find morals for you. Did you leave them behind somewhere, or are they in one of the rubbish bins between your workplace and my room? Because I remember seeing you at work, you're really respectful and kind to others. That's the William I like. Or maybe I should also throw away my morals in order to be with you? We at least need to match in this aspect. Where can I throw them away to that is safe? And what if I throw away my morals and we still don't match, and instead someone else steals my morals too...?</p>
<p>In her anxiety she was becoming puffed. It wasn't the sound of the wind sweeping through the trees, and it wasn't the flicker of the stars in the sky that kept him jarred. It was the shape of her anxiety, the smell, taste, touch, sound, of it. </p>
<p>“I'll keep your morals” he said, as if he understood the nonsense she was talking about. “I'll store them in a jar so you can go to it any time.” He put his arm around neck and shoulders and they stared at the sky together. He felt her breathing underneth his arm fast and shallow like a little mouse. She wouldn't live long breathing that fast and eating that little. “Charlotte, I really like you, I may have a lot of women in my life, but if thats taught me anything, it's that I really enjoy your company and I really feel close to you, you're special to me, I need you, so don't ever talk about going away and things okay? Now let me tell you about my life” He said it with such resolve that she felt an itch on her shoulder and didn't dare scratch  it to interrupt him.</p>
<p>“I'm walking along, my life is fine, despite what everyone says and thinks, I don't need anything. But always from the side there people, some smiling, some crying, some angry, they keep coming to me to offer me this and that. Some offer me big money, some offer me expensive things in top tier stores, some offer me women, I am offered anything. SO I become distracted from where I'm supposed to walk. It's like everyone on the street's handing out fliers of how I should live my live my lie of a life. From over ehre and over there, where I should spend my money, my resources that I was born with, and who I should talk to and not talk to, and what I should believe. What I shouldn't believe, and who I should show kindness to and who to ignore. The list goes on and on. Everything is offered in a nonjudgmental way. No one would dare judge you, because that is our culture, but it's pretty much that way. The women in my life get together and talk about me as if I'm theirs, and they understand what I should be doing and what I'm doing wrong. And they don't give me a chance to voice myself.</p>
<p>“So, where am I supposed to go?” Charlotte.</p>
<p>“How should I know, stop asking me. Are you asking me because you want an answer? Or are you asking me to prove a point?”</p>
<p>“Before I knew it, I can't live without these judgments, it's like all my life instead of food and kindness, I've been nurtured on judgments and moralities. And now my footsteps are colliding with others. Even though I'm supposed to be self sufficient and not needing anything else that anyone else says, even though I'm supposed to be an adult.</p>
<p>“I think you're mature enough” she said, “An adult rarely thinks about these things, so I think you're even more mature.</p>
<p>They started walking to his room, William still with his arm around her. He felt comforted to talk to her, but she knew that was it. It wouldn't go further with him, he couldn't commit.</p>
<p>“My girlfriend he said, I think you know her?”</p>
<p>“I do” she said.</p>
<p>“I'm buying an expensive thing for her, so I'm saving up money”</p>
<p>“Oh, cool”</p>
<p>“She likes the earrings in the store, and she never told me she wanted them but I know she really likes the emerald ones and her birthday is coming up, so I want to get them for her.”</p>
<p>“Then get them” Charlotte felt happy to hear his secret, but was sad that she wasn't a part of it, she was just an ear to listen to him. And then he unlocked his door and she noticed how his room was so empty, there was nothing of character. He was living here, but his memories and his life force weren't here, they were somewhere else. It was just like a big trashcan that got emptied every weekend, there was no commitment to this room. He just occupied the space. And then she wondered if she would become the same, if this didn't work out with them then would she be thrown away like all of the other things in his life? Would she also become a vague and hazy memory in his life that ultimately didn't mean anything? There's no trace here of other women, of any history. He was like brand new concrete with no marks or scrapes, devoid of anythin, the same inside as outside. She felt like she was just the next girl in line, and after her would be another and another.</p>
<p>This made her so sad, and she collapsed on his bed and started crying. She covered her face with her arm, and her mouth with the bed covers, she didn't want to show him how she cried. Even though crying was a public display of grief.</p>
<p>He didn't know her state and started undressing her, methodically, like she was a barbie doll, or like he was cooking dinner, or brushing his teeth, or changing into pyjamas. Her outer items came off, and he was feeling up her bare stomach with a finger pinned to her belly button.</p>
<p>So she asked him about his past girlfriends, “Who you used to be with” She tried to pry her way open into his private life by force, so she could step into it and run around and fart and shit and laugh her head off and make him remember her. It was a challenge, hopefully she could change him to believe in her. She was excited by the challenge of changing such a stoic and dry man into a warm and kind soul, she saw so much potential in him as well.</p>
<p>Then, without any prompting, he said something that made her heart beat, “They're not important right now, only you are, I've forgotten about them” This made her smile and dry up her tears. He had already shown progress.</p>
<p>She couldn't help wondering about his past relationships, all of the things he did and the people he had been with. But even when he talked about them she couldn't believe it, it seems so farfetched for him to even be with anyone.</p>
<p>He said, “I don't want to tell you that I've been with five hundred girls already.”</p>
<p>And suddenly her vision vanished, and she saw only him, surrounded by five hundred women, a whole area of women making him their own. And a condensation began. It was a cycle that she kept  going through again and again.</p>
<p>“So will I be the same as them?” she said,  “And does that mean that they aren't special right now because they're in the past? So if this doesn't work out will you forget about me as well? Am I  just another girl in line that you've met? How can you show that I'm special to you beyond the other girls?” She started crying again, and wiping her eyes with her elbows, “Sorry William, to be so weak, but I'm beginning to have doubts again.”</p>
<p>On a snowy night after work, William sat outside on the bench where he was suppsoed to meet Charlotte, he wiped away the snow off where he was sitting and his hand froze. He kicked the snow off and sat there waiting for her arrival, but she never arrived. He waietd and waited, it wasn't like her to be late. </p>
<p>But she never showed, and he walked back home in the snow, alone, growing smaller and smaller as he went further and further away. </p>
<p>Some part of her had died that night, it was warm in the air despite the snow coating the ground and the wind showering it into every corner that existed. The hotel had no trace of it , it was sheltered safely and soundly for the dear guests. Work went on as usual.</p>
<p>Some part of Charlotte had disappeared, along with many other things people had lost.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-six-simulation-1">thirty six: Simulation 1</h3>
<p>“Alright” Mr. Angry announced, “We're having a test run” Everyone was gathered and enough time had passed, they had to prepare for the real heist. “Next week at this time we'l have a simulation, I've written your scripts and put them in the corners so take the one with your name on it and re-read it. The situation has been made as similar as possible, just that it's at a different time and the rooms are different, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay” everyone said. And by everyone, it was Mr. Chatterbox. The others sat there like practice dummies for boxers.</p>
<p>“Let's develop the plan” Mr. Angry said, “We need to hire a housekeeper to get us the masterkey to access every room, it also gives us access to the elevator to get to the GM”s room”</p>
<p>“You're a housekeeper Mr. Angry” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“But I'm doing other things.”</p>
<p>“How about Lula” Mr. Danger said, “She's roommates with Dina”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy publically shook his head, “I  refuse it, she's a good girl, I don't want to get her involved in this” Mr. Melancholy worked with her sometimes, he was usually selfish, but held the door open for her, and she knew she was the only one he held the door open for, and she took this as a special sign and at night in privacy, she prayed in gratitude and thankfulness that a guy cared about her. It also made her heart beat in excitement at having a boy.</p>
<p>“Now Mr. Purple has a very important part of this mission” Mr. Angry said, “She's to be directly involved with the GM” Mr. Angry brought out a new sheet of paper, on the flip side were detailed coloured notes.  “Now here's a thought experiment” he said. “We're in a room, and there's artifacts from everywhere, all sorts of things, like old books, old pin needles, four or five sewing kits, and chocolate wrappers. This kind of thing everywhere around the room. And all of these things were once invented by other people, they were made hand by hand by other people who were here and who were doing their own things, with their own things. Do you get it?” </p>
<p>“Get what” Mr. Lazy said, “What's that got to do with the paper?”</p>
<p>“Never mind the paper” Mr. Angry put the paper down, “Imagine this scene for now”</p>
<p>“I see it” Mr. Chatterbox said, “And I'm bored”</p>
<p>But Mr. Melancholy got it, Mr. Angry was talking about things, how things were everywhere, and they were made from people and had their own bigraphies and histories and connections. They were respected objects that shared our environment with us. In a sense people were objects that kept changing all the time. And it helped him see how things had happened today.</p>
<p>“Imagine this scene, so you know exactly why things are happening right now, and where. We're stealing an object for money, but essentially we're taking one object that is also prized by many others. So I need you to understand this, just imagine it”</p>
<p>It slowly began to click for each member one by one, and after fifteen minutes everyone got it. There was nothing to confirm that everyone understood, there was no words that those who understood could speak to convey their understanding. It was just something that happened, the air changed, the atmosphere became something unique and treasured and that was it.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was a genius. </p>
<p>“Now, this paper” Mr. Angry raised the paper once more, “It's a simulation of the final room and how it will be. This hotel only works because of the GM's meticulous personality, he has rules for everything, it's the only way he can make sense of his world. When they feed him spinach and light sugars for breakfast he is 5% more likely to follow through on his organization, which makes him 5% more predictable.”</p>
<p>“What does 5% even mean?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“It means there's a 5% more chance of us succeeding you dumb cunt” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“No, because that's not the percentage of us doing things you idiot, that's the percentage of the GM being predictable it doesn't say anything.” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Look” Mr. Angry raised his hands, and that meant everyone should quiet down and listen to him. “It's the percentage against the GM figuring out something is wrong and fishy, and doing something different from his usual tasks.” Mr. Angry said, “As long as he does the same thing day in and day out, we can work against him. He repeats the same actions because they are the msot reliable and safe for the hotel, but we can use that habituality against him. Now for example, let's test Mr. Purple and Mr. Lazy with this” he held up a can of spaghetti. It was one of the plain cans of spaghetti that would not attract anyone's attention.</p>
<p>“We'll see Mr. Purple and Mr. Lazy, which of them is more likely to open a can of spaghetti.”</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with anything?” Mr. Chatterbox said. “Are you hungry boss?”</p>
<p>“You two, take turns trying to open this, whoever opens it first gets the contents” Mr. Angry handed them a can opener and the can.</p>
<p>To everyone's surprise, when Mr. Purple took her turn, she used the can opened to hammer the can like it was a nail and tried to bust it open.</p>
<p>“What...” Mr. Melancholy said. Mr. Purple gave him the finger in frustration.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy saw the can opener and dismissed it, he went directly to the can and tried jumping on it. But it still didn't open.</p>
<p>“You both don't know how to open a can?” Mr. Danger said, “Why are we working with these people? I don't understand, surely there are more competent people in this hotel”</p>
<p>Both of them looked back at him frustrated. It was Mr. Purple's turn, and she took the can opener, everyone held their breath in anticipation. Did she finally get what she was supposed to do?</p>
<p>She looked up at Mr. Angry, “Can I get this straight? So we're supposed to get what's inside the can and not what's on the outside of it?”</p>
<p>Did she finally get it? What was on the outside of a can anyway?</p>
<p>“Yes” Everyone said.</p>
<p>She picked up the can opener, and used the other side like scissors to squeeze it open. Then when it didn't work she wiped her forehead of swear. </p>
<p>Mr. Lazy went next and he shook the can and listened to the insides sloshing around. “I think I got it” he said, “If you shake it the right way it opens right, like a code? I know how it opens now so I'm not going to bother” He put the can back down. </p>
<p>Everyone stared at them dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry, like a teacher filled with patience with his hands caressing each other, asked them, “Have you ever heard of a can opener?” </p>
<p>Mr. Purple looked back, she was still sweating hard. All of her energy had been exerted into this. “What does that do? Somehow magically open cans?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah? Of course? Duh?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry showed them how a can opener worked, and the two of them became overjoyed, “It's this simple?” Mr. Purple said, “That's so easy, I can't believe I didn't think of it before”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger said he felt the whole thing was offensive to the two of them, ir Mr. Angry wanted to prove a point he could have done it better. But Mr. Melancholy felt like Mr. Danger hadn't gotten the right point, the point wasn't to humiliate the two, but to humiloiate everyone there, because they were all the same, using one thing in one way and not knowing anything else.</p>
<p>“I think Mr. Angry wanted us to open our minds” Mr. Melancholy said, “Because this heist is nothing normal”</p>
<p>“Well, there are much better ways of doing that” Mr. Danger was still unpurged.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox agrred with him. “I'm  nefarious woman” she said, “And most of the time I say things to make others dislike me, and I stand out from a bunch of cows like a bull with horns, butI say what I'm thinking, and I agree with Mr. Danger, it was too much.”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger asked Mr. Chatterbox out and she smiled and giggled and agreed. Perhaps only because she knew that Mr. Melancholy was watching, and as she said, she was nefarious, and was insidious enough to do anything to make anyone around her jealous of her. She scribbled her number out on a tidy piece of paper and slipped it to Mr. Danger. She knew he was gay, everyone knew he was gay. But Mr. Melancholy liked her still so it didn't matter.</p>
<p>After the brief break Mr. Angry dove straight into it again. </p>
<p>“Okay, so here's how it's going to go. Mr. Purple will go to the GM and make him attracted. She is the perfect type for him.”</p>
<p>“She's the perfect type in general” Mr. Lazy was unable to keep his eyes off her.</p>
<p>“The GM will decide to give up his precious virginity, something important for her. He has been working all his life, always working, and decides for now, for the first time to try out something more, maybe he can step out of this boundary, as he was told by this new woman he met. Because Mr. Purple will be saying this kind of thing to him to slowly make him change his mind, it's all written in her script. After about a week he will think of her more and more and think that she may be right. He can stop working and nothing is going to change, the world isn't going to crumble. After a week and a half he will put a first blank in his schedule in ten years and his secretary, Mrs. Rohansson, will be concerned, she'll say something like “Are you sure? You've never done this before””</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was doing his predications and speculations again. Mr. Melancholy could see how someone like him had to do this kind of activity to feel worthwhile.</p>
<p>“I'm sure” the GM will say. Because he has finally made a change, and will feel confident that mr. Purple is backing him up.”</p>
<p>“Then the secretary, Mrs. Rohansson smiles, her boss has finally changed for something more interesting, and she has been waiting for this for a long time”</p>
<p>“I'm sure you can find another lovely person” she said. Because she already knows that her boss only puts blanks in his schedule every decade because he meets a fantastic woman. Now what he doesn't know is that Mr. Purple has designed this and is going to take advantage of him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple nodded and laughed here and there. She was so confident and shameless. Mr. Melancholy wondered how many other powerful she had manipulated with her beauty. How much more pure loves she had devalued.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry went on, telling his story with absolute certainty, “Then he uses this time to get with our Mr. Purple who he puts on a pedestal, buying her gift after gift of fashionable items. It's good to be a beautiful woman, not really a woman.”</p>
<p>“Up to here” Mr. Angry said, “I have predicted with about 87% accuracy, but from here it gets a bit wishy washy, but don't worry, I have taken measures to inihibit the negative reactions.” He started saying what sounded like random details, but to him they were highly relevant tropes of information. “Sexual connection makes more hormones for females, prenatal androgen exposure”</p>
<p>“So from here the GM will feel so lucky to have someone like Mrs. Purple in his life. Through our script he knows her as Diana. His Diana is always slim and wearing bright colorful dresses. She gives him just a little and hides enough away to keep him guessing and thinking about her. Meanwhile, he says he loves her but cheats on her with a different woman, he has become used to sex now. Then our dear Mr. Purple will  find herself upset for some reason, because she has also become attached to him slightly.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple smiled, “Really? I don't think so”</p>
<p>Even her actions had been predicted. Someone who he saw as special and unique, because beauty was the most unique attribute.</p>
<p>“She tells him in the script that although she swore not to fall for another man ever again because last time she did, something horrible happened. She decides that he wasn't worth it anyway and will go on with her life and ignore him and all of his designs. She comes to a conclusion that about 6% of women come to, that a woman can live without a man but a man can't live without a woman.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy saw what Mr. Angry saw, the GM not as a unique and powerful man, but actually in his power and meticulousness, he had become a set of statistics that was capable of being anaalyzed and understoof down to minute details. His folly was not being a human. Now the GM sounded like some sort of character in a story that had all its actions planned beforehand rather than a human with Free Will and volition.</p>
<p>He was bored.</p>
<p>“She can do all that and not love him, I almost feel sorry for the poor man” Mr. Lazy said, “My wife would never do that, her heart is too big to”</p>
<p>“Are you sure she doens't love him? You can only do those things if you love someone”</p>
<p>“She doesn't, she knows it more than anyone.”</p>
<p>“How do you know”</p>
<p>“Mr. Purple is a scary woman, she does all this and says all this, but she doesn't love him a bit, I woudln't want to be on the other side of her. She's a master of deception. Most people are clear, you know what they're thinking, but she's different, you don't know at all.</p>
<p>“It's a script, don't forget that” Mr. Purple said. “I'm just following a script”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy looked at her“If I could look under your pocket, or somewhere, I bet you've hidden a script for your life, everything that happens in your lfie is scripted, it's just to figure out how to read your script and figure out there they've hidden it. All people are scripted, but you especially” Mr. Lazy didn't know it, but he felt a tinge of jealousy at her freedom, and a tinge of anger at her scrubbing away of him. It a very minute amounts of each, if he felt a general happiness that was yellow, the other emotions would be so dim that only after gazing at them a long time you would finally start to see coming out. They were always there but they were so dim that most people didn't see them. And in this case no one had seen them either, but Mr. Lazy said this because of the small amount of vengeance he held in himself. If he knew it, he would have become embarrassed, it was all because he was attracted to this woman and unable to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple could have been offended, she could have blown up in anger, or she could have shrunken back in embarrassment, but what she did was, she shrugged nonchalantly. “Sure whatever”</p>
<p>They took their scripts from the corner and read through them. “In our next meeting, we'll meet at our allotted spots and start the mission, it's simple, all you have to do is follow what's written on there, I've made sure that no one will walk past and the obstructions will be cleared. You just need to follow the instructions, we're stealing a piece of golden paper, that's the practice.”</p>
<p>Privately, as an aside, Mr. Melancholy, fascinated with Mr. Angry's vocality, asked him abobut the possibilities and how he speculated. Mr. Angry sat on his stool with his bum hanging over and hius legs hanging over the other side.</p>
<p>“For example right after she confesses, and he cheats, how could she feel, there are a plethora of possibilities, and each possibiity has a different action, which in turn leads to a different action from  those around her. For example she could feel guilty, for making him feel bad enough to cheat, so she starts to avoid his calls. She could feel angry at him, like he had treaded over her sincerity, and then she yells at him and harasses him. Or she could feel embarrassed and not tell anyone, eventually becoming depressed. These are all possibilities, or you could combine different reactions. And it also depends on who you meet, different people will make you feel a different way. SO I can only tell you the probabloility of her running into a certain friend on a certain day, and after averaging out everything, the safest probability is the heist. There is no luck or hope, it's all probabilities that have been calculated beforehand.” He wasn't upset at having to repeat what was in his head, he wasn't proud to know so much, and he didn't feel strange to be saying this. He was in a meditative state beyond that.</p>
<p>After work, Mr. Chatterbox threw away Mr. Danger's number and they were suddenly strangers again.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-seven-simulation-2">thirty seven: Simulation 2</h3>
<p>The next week everyone gathered at their spots and went through the instructions. No one was sure of what anyone else was doing, they did their own actions and just trusted that others were all doing the same. They held the information sheets in their hands or sticking out of their pockets..</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy, Mr. Lazy, and Mr. Danger had to work together to kidnap a woman. It was just a practice and they had no idea why they had to do this, but if they didn't comply it would be worse.</p>
<p>When they were practicing the heist, they did it so casually, wearing the masks, and holding sticks walk in to the room. Then they got the wrong room and walked into the room next door. One of the housekeepers saw them and was so afraid. She had been looking outside at the trees in the air, and watching TV whiel eating sunflower seeds and spitting the shells out. It was a casual raid, while she was outside looking at the scenery, or watching TV, the criminals came in with masks. She recognized one of them as well, from the socks he was wearing. She sighed, “It's always me, this kind of thing always happens to me. Okay, go ahead take me”</p>
<p>They took her and went to the next room, Mr. Melancholy knocked on the door, he looked around in fear of cameras, “Room Service” he said through his mask. Mr. Lazy and Mr. Danger were behind him, shaking slightly. He couldn't tell which of them was which, only that he himself was Mr. Melancholy.</p>
<p>The lady in the room opened the door, and saw three masks come in, they were holding guns and pranced in like they were skipping. </p>
<p>She screamed, but they held her mouth. They saw fake teeth on the bathroom counter and started laughing uncontrollably, although the mouth on the masks didn't move.</p>
<p>“Hey” the lady recgonizes one of the guys as the guy behind the counter that she met earlier today. She tried to talk to him, but he shook his head.</p>
<p>“I'm not that guy” he said, tying her arms up with cellotape. </p>
<p>“You are” the lady said, “I recognize your height and your soul through your mask, nothing can block your soul off. And you can do this kind of thing, but I don't think it's really you to be doing this”</p>
<p>Finally, he took his mask off and she saw his mane of red hair, then she apologized and crouched before his gun that was pointing at her foreheard. “I hope your mother never finds out what you're doing”</p>
<p>“I hope she does” he said.</p>
<p>There was a corruption fee for mother's approval.
Then the lady saw the guitar case that one fo the men was holding, and she was smiling, “Do we get a private show?” She saw the other woman who was tied up as well, “I haven't had a young man in my room for a long time, let alone three of them” </p>
<p>She was older and a bit clueless, and hadn't seen many men up close for a long time, and had forgotten how dishonest and inconsiderate they could be.</p>
<p>“You're the guy from the store, you were so friendly I recognize you from your socks, so play us a song, women love songs”</p>
<p>“They're not mine, I took his socks and am wearing them now”</p>
<p>Then she started laughing, because it was so incredulous and ridiculous, no one sane could possibly believe their story. Then the guys knew their cover was blown and tried desperately to silence her.</p>
<p>“Okay okay, I'll stop laughing, now what are you going to do, are you going to tie me up and attack me? Are you going to hurt me? You guys aren't like that, you work behind a desk okay?”</p>
<p>“Take us seriously lady, where we work or where we don't work.”</p>
<p>“OOOOhhh, scary words, I'm so scared. Does your gun vibrate? I like to be told what to do, please punish me. Actually I'm a submissive, do I talk too much? People tell me I talk too much.”</p>
<p>“Behind his mask, Mr. Lazy swallowed, he was freaked out” Mr. Danger narrated it word for word out loud. </p>
<p>The man caleld Mr. Melancholy behind his mask, was looking through the script again, “Idiot, you opened the wrong door, it's the wrong room you idiot, this woman isn't the woman we're supposed to take.”</p>
<p>“Well I just followed the door he opened”</p>
<p>“He opened that door, but you said this one...”</p>
<p>“Okay you two stop arguing, we failed okay, if we go back now we're going straight to jail.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do?”</p>
<p>“I don't know okay?”</p>
<p>The lady said, “How about you bad boys can kidnap me, just make sure not to touch my hair, that takes a long time to be done, and oh, don't pull my sweater either, actually I'll just take it off” She gave it to one of the guys to rest on his arm, then sat back and they picked her up and took her out She looked up at these handsome men, feeling their strong arms carrying her. “So who's  kidnapping who?”</p>
<p>“Can you shut this woman up?” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>Daniel saw his men walking past with the woman and became sunset. “What are you guys doing, you're supposed to leave the woman”</p>
<p>“She found out, okay?” The three men said in unison.</p>
<p>Daniel sighed and took the woman from them. “You were supposed to go to the next room over, seriously” He took the lady's hand and put her in the room behind him that he had prepared. It had curtains, that smelled strongly like they had just been taken out of plastic wrapping. </p>
<p>The lady loved it, the whole package of this unique experience. She was so excited to be taken around like this by strange men with foul language. Mr. Danger and Mr. Melancholy and Mr. Lazy saw her enthusiasm with Mr. Angry and became a bit jealous and respectful. Because they had been dealing with this woman, and he took her away from them so easily with the excuse of it being part of his job. “I was going to marry her later” Mr. Danger said, still staring her down as she disappeared behind the door, with one arm closing the doorknob.</p>
<p>“But you're gay, have you forgotten?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I forgot” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy put on his spectacles and looked through the script, he went to the next destination that was written. “It says that next we're supposed to go up the elevator.”</p>
<p>They went to the third elevator as indicated, this was an elevator that was shared betweenn staff and customers. There was probably some profound reason Mr. Angry wanted them to take this elevator. Mr. Melancholy still had a hard time realizing that this was actually an organized heist they were practicing, it was just that everyone here seemed so casual about it.</p>
<p>When they were in the elevator Mr. Danger couldn't stop thinking about it. “He said it was a rehearsal and then took the prisoner.”</p>
<p>“Stop thinking about it you dumbass” Mr. Lazy said, “It's a simple mission, follow orders and thats it.” They stood sticking their weaty bodies side by side in the elevator, when they bumped into each other the long arms were slimy, Mr. Danger's arms were hairy, and felt uncomfortable to touch.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy knew there were only five of them, Mr. Purple must be at the end, he had no idea what she was doing. It was exciting to know everyone was working together. After the elevator his script diverged from the others and he waited outside the elevator while the other two went off to get some towels and put them in a trolley to take up. He was to wait here for the guest to arrive. It said that he was pretending to be a security guard escorting a customer up.</p>
<p>That was what it said on the paper. He rolled I back up and stuffed it in his pocket. The elevator came and went to the other floors but there was no sign of his customer.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Angry came out of the elevator. It stopped where Mr. Melancholy was waiting. To be honest this was also scripted, but Mr. Melancholy hadn't noticed it.</p>
<p>“Just another five minutes.” Mr. Angry said, “I unlocked the gates downstairs so she can come through, and I'm going to change the screen on the security cameras so no one knows, meanwhile Mr. Danger will be contacting reception about a problem he has. Mr. Lazy will be standing in the linen closet by now. The GM will be moving through the third corridor, on his fourth break to the bathroom for today, and the shopkeepers will be in the vicinity. Mr. Chatterbox will be in the next room guarding it, you'll see her.” Mr. Angry relayed this information more for himself, to get a hang of what was happening and where everyone was right now. He kept checking his watch to make sure the times conincided. The watch was his prayer.</p>
<p>“How about Mr. Purple?” Mr. Melancholy said, “Where is she?” His voice was dry and quiet. </p>
<p>Mr. Angry didn't answer. Mr. Angry broke into the room in front of him, just another permanently locked room that Mr. Melancholy had no idea what was inside. The doors all looked the same after a while. Mr. Angry looked around, his head bobbed away like it was floating in the ocean. “There's nothing here, damn” he said. He had done all the code locks and combinations and was sweating so much now, either from the physical movement, or the pressure of time. It was only a rehearsal, Mr. Melancholy wondered how much he would sweat in the real thing. Would he even be able to do it?”</p>
<p>“You'll be fine” Mr. Angry momentarily abandoned his strenuous activity and was on Mr. Melancholy's shoulder with a warm arm. “Don't worry”</p>
<p>These were simple words, but for some reason they really made him feel comfortable. Mr. Melancholy felt like a sincere bond was a bit closer between them, and it was comforting to know that someone else was going through the same thing as he was. Although in hindsight Mr. Angry was probably just saying this to make sure William succeeded.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry left in the elevator. In the script it said that he was to act like a security guard to anyone who came past, and if it was the customer, he was to escort them up to the GM's room. In this rehearsal it was a meeting room on the penultimate floor.</p>
<p>The elevator clanged at the different floors, he started to grow familiar to its sounds, he felt like he knew what it was saying to him in its strange language.</p>
<p>Before he realized, the door opened and she was in front of him. Mr. Purple was tied up in golden lingerie, her hands and feet were bound by a thin rope that would leave a mark. She was gagged and kept nodding when she saw him. Her hair was designed expensively like a ferrari. She was more beautiful than ever.</p>
<p>It took him a while to realize that she must be his customer, he hurriedly entered the elevator and punched in the button for the top floor. He swiped the card to ensure the elevator would go. </p>
<p>Then slowly he looked behind, he glanced as if she were a stranger. The way she was tied up and unable to talk made him feel guilty, and she saw it in his eyes. He felt distant from her and wanted to help her. She shook her head trying to tell him there was no need, it was a rehearsal.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy didn't understand why she eneded to be gagged and bound up, wasn't this inhumane? Then again, stealing was criminal activity.</p>
<p>The door opened and Mr. Melancholy led his customer out, he held her in his arms, her legs dangling off one side, and her on his left, she was looking up at him. He held her head carefully to make her as comfortable as he could. He came to the door which was supposed to be the room and knocked. </p>
<p>She looked at him, and he looked at her.</p>
<p>After two separate knocks, the door opened and a well groomed Mr. Angry was smiling with one hand on the doorknob. He took the customer from Mr. Melancholy's arms and took her inside. He closed the door behind him, leaving Mr. Melancholy to watch.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry, in front of him, went up to Mr. Purple, and wordlessly caressed her hair, staring in her eyes like they were a television program. He wordlessly untied her legs and arms, and wordlessly slipped her golden bra off. Then he slipped everything off her. He had on dirty jeans stained with paint, and hadn't showered in a few weeks, his beard was stiff and prickly like a gorse bush, and his shoes were disgusting. He stepped forward and impregnated her.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was in shock. This was a rehearsal right? Why was Mr. Angry doing this, he needed to be serious.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry finished and left his sperm and the woman there. He stepped away, dissecting the panting. And then quietly left. It was exactly as it said on the script, Mr. Melancholy kept reading through it.</p>
<p>He was supposed to be guarding the doorway and assaulting anyone who entered. In this rehearsal no one entered. </p>
<p>Now he needed to take Mr. Purple back out. Now he understood, he always thought they had been hired in this heist for the specific talents they had to offer, but after witnessing this he knew that Mr. Purple's job wasn't a talent, it was to be beautiful and distract the GM. That was her role in the mission, in a sense she was a very expensive prostitute. In a way, he was meant to be falling for her. It wasn't strange.</p>
<p>And then he understood the frightening feeling he was having, so that was what it felt to fall in love.</p>
<p>“I'm going to do this” he said, “I'm going to do this” as he went up to the woman who lay there naked on the table.</p>
<p>She looked like she was sleepy as he put her clothes back on, he found her golden bra on the floor and wrapped it around her chest, he did it up behind her. She didnt' know what was happening, she acted oblivious to the world, in a way it was the way Mr. Purple always was. He fell for her harder after seeing her similarities. To her he was a servant, she was probably so used to this.</p>
<p>He picked her underwear up off the floor as well. It was sickly wet, like it had been in a washing machine. He spread it out and wanted to sniff it, but held back the urge. And then when he touched her toes to put her underwear back on he stiffened up. She whimpered when he touched her toes, he wanted to massage them. He wanted to reach down and stick his fingers in her folds and hear her moan, he wanted to kiss her and take her voice away. He needed to let her know what he wanted. </p>
<p>She was right there, naked, the woman of his dreams. He could do anything he wanted. </p>
<p>But he didn't do anything, he wrapepd her underwear on her obediently, like a stick, like a tree that rustled in the wind in silent protest. She laughed at him, but she wasn't actually laughing. He slipped it up her legs, briefly feeling the wetness on the back of his fingers. </p>
<p>He wondered what would happen if he touched her, what kind of special sound she would make. As he put her skirt back on, and her shoes, and her top. And he stared at her lips, she stared back, as he thought about kissing them he sat her up and gagged her.</p>
<p>She was gagged up again, and looked untouched like nothing had happened to her.</p>
<p>Once again he looked at her, her body was right there in front of him, but he wasn't allowed to touch her or lay a finger on her. And it was torturing him to be unable to do anything to her. If he did anything, the whole heist might mess up, but it was just a rehearsal right? She stood in the elevator innocently, gagged up still. He had no idea why she needed to be gagged.</p>
<p>He couldn't resist it any longer, he leaned over and took off her gag, she didnt' speak a word as he kissed her. </p>
<p>He stepped back and admired her, and she was unhappy. “I'm shocked” she said, “What do you think this is, a joke?”</p>
<p>It was the first time she had spoken and he felt reality suddenly pumping in. He had just violated the rules.</p>
<p>“Why? It's a rehearsal, what's this got to do with anything?” He defended himself.</p>
<p>She shook her head, “Will we even be able to get through the doors in the real thing with hopeless people like you”</p>
<p>She was extremely arrogant, at least he got that feeling. And she looked normal, and he wondered how many times she had done this, if she was a pornstar or something in her home life. The woman he loved had been destroyed by dirty old men around her. But she always looked spectacular and beautiful.</p>
<p>The elevator door opened to mixed feelings barging out and escaping into the open air unobstructed by those things called 'superstitions' and 'fears'. The feelings were so strong that they wrecked everything in their path. Mr. Purple went back home, and Mr. Purple went the other way, wherever that was. The script ended here, and he felt lost. She was more loyal than him, and she didnt' feel the same way back to him. He was such a player and his emotions were out of hand. He didn't know how he would feel about her tomorrow, or even in an hour.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-eight-you-still-get-women-with-that-attitudewilliams-sexual-escapades">thirty eight: “You still get women with that attitude?”/William's Sexual Escapades</h3>
<p>He went through the staff door, ti was instantly busy on the other side, staff were walking fast getting to the next place. William felt a hand on his shoulder,he turned around and looked up and saw Mr. Lazy. A.K.A. Jason. </p>
<p>“I think we should catch up” he said.</p>
<p>They sat in the cafe outside the hotel, it was one of the other options of sitting down and relaxing. William wondered why Mr.Lazy would want to talk. They lived completely different lives. He looked down at his hands around his coffee cup, Jason was more mature. Everything about him said so.</p>
<p>“So, William, how many women do you have, if you don't mind me asking”</p>
<p>“What's this about?”</p>
<p>“It's just simple curiosity” Jason shook it off, “I'm just curious you know, from one guy to another. I'm trying to be a good person, we work together so I thought I could try to get to know you better.”</p>
<p>“None of your business” he said.</p>
<p>“You're a popular guy arne't you, I wish I could be as popular as you, and younger” Jason said, half looking at William to prompt an answer.</p>
<p>“Shut up, they're all just nagging bitches”</p>
<p>“And you still get women with that attitude? Are you serious? What did I do wrong?”</p>
<p>William's hands were still around the coffee cup, he wasn't cold, but he felt a little afraid of Jason, he couldn't say why. “You're married dude, you're a the end of the race where all the guys are waving flags and congratulating you.”</p>
<p>Jason saw William had a chain, and was fiddling with it. He commented. “Then you're like a King lion, one of those beasts you see on TV, and you're prowling around, watching all of your females. Managing your investments, taking care of your assets.”</p>
<p>“You could say so” William still couldn't decide if Jason was making fun of him because he was a funny guy, or if he was genuinely curious.</p>
<p>“So you happy?” Jason was interrogating. He always hung out with the young ones who weren't married and had their life in front of him, he came home late and his wife wanted to know him better and tried to set a curfew on him. And when he walked in the door he had to have a security check done, which was to have his junk sniffed by her, and if all went well it led to sex.</p>
<p>“If that makes me sound cool, that's aight”</p>
<p>“I'm pretty sure last night I was walking around and heard you and one of your women crying about something, and then I went and said hi, want to remind me what happened?”</p>
<p>Jason had turned up while William was talking to Charlotte on the same bench as usual. And he scoffed at William for having to deal with this stuff.</p>
<p>“Your life is better than mine, is that what you're trying to rub in my face?” Jason had so much ego that he had to even tell William this. “Or do you regret gettign married, what are you trying to tell me?”</p>
<p>“Then how come you don't get married?” Jason said. “If my life is better than yours. ”</p>
<p>Jasonw as being really weird right now and he wanted to leave, he wanted to get out of this cafe and not have to spend time with this man. He felt scared, and he didn't know what Jason's wife saw in him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, out of nowhere, Gerry A.K.A Mr. danger butted in.He had also been visiting the same cafe. As soon as he sat down the modo changed, and Jason returned back to the casual guy he ahd always been. </p>
<p>Where had all that tension come from? William wondered, he watched as Jason laughed and shared jokes with Gerry, and he knew he had to act the same, like nothing had happened. He couldn't make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>Gerry talked about Mr. Chatterbox. </p>
<p>“One of William's girlfriend's, you know the two of them have sex regularly?” Jason said.</p>
<p>Gerry stopepd and looked at Jason, then went on, ignoring the comment. That meant that Gerry was on William's side. Jason was extremely jealous, but he acted like he was superior and didn't care. That was the scariest type of jealousy.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox is one of those typical women” Gerry said, “She has to be right. I notice a lot of things that you heterosexual guys don't notice, because I'm not staring at a woman's boobs or ass or bombs, I'm not affected by her charm, so I see her properly, and their actions are sometimes so selfish, I'm saying this not to be judgmental, I'm just saying what I see”</p>
<p>“I'm a man, so I see how other guys act selfish” William said, “It's the same concept”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox, in a group discussion she always will criticizing others for expressing themselves and having to be right, but actually she herself, she always has to be right, so thats what she sees in others. She thinks she's so right and perfect, and whenever someone tells her she's wrong she falls quiet. She only sees how she is commended by her boss, who's also my boss by the way, and he encourages everyone so she doesnt know what she's talking about. But she only sees it when he says something good about her. </p>
<p>Gerry had some strong opinions of his colleague, and because Annalise was his girlfriend, he kind of had the same feeling, but never dared admit it. For some reason that was something he didn't want to think about her. Because he felt like he was a liar and a cheater and was bad, that was what he had been told all his life. But Annalise had never said this to him, so it was a nice change to have someone believe in you, it's a big confidence booster. And now he felt embarrassed that he was even involved in this conversation, and he felt a pity for her to have others hold these opinions on her.</p>
<p>He fell quiet, just like she was quiet in her absence from this conversation. And he felt hopeful that no one would notice it if they were both quiet. She was only quiet because he was. And he liked it this way, because it meant that they could both be comfortable in their quietness together.</p>
<p>“She's your girlfriend right?” Gerry said, “Sorry to say this, but I speak what I think about everyone, I'm an honest guy, sometims it comes across as rude, but....” he shrugged, meaning so what.</p>
<p>“I know you're thinking though, and it's good to be in a relationship, believe it or not I support you, this world is too solitary. Just don't be thinking too much, because you might get bored of something. So if it's about her, then I want you to stop thinking too much because I'm afraid you will get bored of her.</p>
<p>Then Gerry dropped the topic and talked about something else like he was flipping a pancake. When it was on one side he talked about women and relationships, when it was on the other side he talked about something else. He was so random, extremely so.</p>
<p>“Did you hear on the news, the terrorism? It used to be so unusual, and now it's happening all the time. How can these people do these things to others? As Jason and William were watching, Gerry lashed out at them saying they were horrible. </p>
<p>Jason was surprised, because Gerry, in the past, did something on a similar level of horribleness and survived it. How could he be saying this now? </p>
<p>Melanie walked past the three men sitting in the cafe, she didnt' notice them. She was dressed in something mildly nice, extremely fancy by her own standards, but mildly nice by the men's standard's, who watched as she walked past absorbed in her own world.</p>
<p>“If we could take her world out and look at it what do you think we'd see?” William said about Melanie.</p>
<p>“Something ugly” Mr. Lazy said, thinking they were talking about the other woman who walked past.</p>
<p>Melanie sat on the bathroom taboo unit and thought about last night as she waited for her bowels to clear. This was the only free time she got during the day. Last night the power had gone out due to a storm at the electric plant 80 kilometers south. She was a night porter but she was scared fo the dark. The hotel was pitch black except for a few eery light green emergency backup lights. She got about fifteen calls from guests in the hotel complaining that their lights had turned off and she patiently explained for about two hours that the power had gone off and lights going off was to be expected. A few of them wanted to upgrade their room, but she explained to them that after upgrading their room, the power would still persist being out.</p>
<p>The ones who understood her, who spoke her language, they continued complaining. The others hung up. After the phone calls she had looked around, only a few exit lights were left on because the hotel was so tight on energy saving. Her own face probably looked like a ghost at the counter. It was such a large difference compared to during the day, when this desk was the heart of the hotel and was the brightest place with the biggest smiles. Right now she probably looked lost like a puppy that had been wandering around for a year in suburbs trying to find its owners.</p>
<p>She didn't clean the toilets that night. The other porters who were male also didn't do it. They were scared as well.</p>
<p>The next morning the boss came along, he walked in the stance of a man who has things under control. He had power all of last night and then the next night. In a politically respectful voice he asked her why the toilets hadn't been cleaned. The way he asked it was like he was accusing her of not cleaning the toilets.</p>
<p>Melanie told the truth. Which was a lie in his view. </p>
<p>After work, she walked out fuming, no one was her boss, how dare they talk to her like that? How come she has to conform and do everything exactly like a machine does, the same as everywhere else. She has been at this job for thirteen years, before her boss even hit puberty and started masturbating.</p>
<p>That was what she was thinking as she walked past, but of course the guys had no clue. </p>
<p>Jason and Gerry left William, and he sat there. When he was alone a woman came up to him. She was one fo the housekeepers, unbeknowest to her, she was nicknamed 'The Pig' by her colleagues due to her weight which had no restrictions. Her waist was as wide as her loneliness and her voice was as deep as a bass drum.</p>
<p>She confessed to William immediately. She said he had a good face and she found him attractive.</p>
<p>Her friend, a wingwoman, who had come to support her friend on the basis of this expression said, “Actually, you're really attractive.” They had no sense of William's past or where he had come from, just that at this moment he was attractive. Effort was not something that could be seen immediately, neither was character, or virtues and values. “Do you want to go out with me?”</p>
<p>“Umm...I don't know, not really” William said.</p>
<p>“Is that a yes or a no?” The wingwoman said, and 'The Pig' nodded in approval. </p>
<p>“Do I have to say it?”</p>
<p>“Just say it, she wants to know.”</p>
<p>There were two other girls behind 'The Pig', William hadn't seen them because they had been blocked from his vision, but they appeared, one was dressed in all red, the other all yellow. They looked like traffic lights. Unknown girl No.1 nodded and said William should just say sorry to her and the girls. “It's so obvious, it's such a simple thing to do as well...”</p>
<p>Unknown girl No. 2 said something that backed her friend up, they were both wearing spaghetti tops in their colours, they were both dressed up for today to meet him. They both opened their legs easily like chopsticks grabbing food, and they used similar terms to describe similar situations.</p>
<p>Because they lived in similar cultures so similar things arose in their lives that they need to describe to each other in similar ways. They both sensed William was different, and that was part of their allure to him.</p>
<p>“No then” he said.</p>
<p>The wing woman nodded, and the big girl who asked him out nodded as well. She smiled a thank you, and the yellow and red girls hid back behind her. They left the room saying goodbye. William never saw the yellow or red girl again.</p>
<p>Then William began thinking about his recent favourite topic, Mr. Purple, he wondered what her real name was, and if she felt any alure to him. And if the reason he was interested in her was becasue he knew nothing about her and she clearly showed no interest in him. If so, what if she started to show interest in him? Would his own interest in her waver?</p>
<p>This happened in his head, as nothing around him changed. </p>
<p>After the girls, Daniel came into the staff lounge. They were both here, it was like old times.</p>
<p>“Hey cheater” Daniel said. He always had something new happening.</p>
<p>“Me? You don't need to say that, a part of me dislikes myself and what I'm doing a lot already” William said. It was a warm and friendly greeting between the two of them, this was where they first met each other, this was where they became something like friends, and this was probably where they would die together as well. That sounded weird, but William felt that way about it sometimes. </p>
<p>“People are saying I look really tired, like I'm running on no sleep” William said. He said this as a means of saying What do you think? A part of him disliked himself and what he was doing, seeing Daniel would pick up on it and hopefully had some advice. A guy didn't need to ask for advice, it just came, like the signposts on a road, or an erection.</p>
<p>“Are you asking for my philosophy?” Daniel said. “About your cheating?”</p>
<p>Daniel caught on, he took the bait. </p>
<p>“You want to know if I have cheated?” There was a long pause before he said this. It was like something was in between him and them. Or it took a long time for the conversation to catch up to their mood. Or just that life here wasn't talked about and it took a while to get used to it. Something happened. </p>
<p>“No, I don't” William said. He would rather not know this about Daniel. Instead, he began talking about his own interests.</p>
<p>“When I was taking out the garbage there was a man who dressed in normal boring clothes, like he was a poor person. But I knew he was rich, because his female had expensive rings, and walked with her nose up, her legs were toned and her breasts looked surgical, she had double eyelid surgery as well and was looking like a Western woman. So I wondered to myself, why is she dressed this way? And the only conclusion I could come up with was that this way he can really see society and the world properly.”</p>
<p>He went on, he found it easy to talk right now, like skating on ice, the words just came out of him like a dump or pee or eating and swallowing. “I was walking outside the cafe at night, and rich people were walking out of a restaurant, then I heard the Eagles playing, and I felt closer to this music than the real people in front of me...I felt closer to distant generations than the immediate ones around me. And one time, I was outside looking up at the stars, and a fifty sixty something eyar old man joined me, and I explained a few of the stars to him, and we began talking about everything, and shared our musical tastes, al the classics, and how they influenced our life at the time, and each song is a day in our life, or a month, or a period where we had these ideas and thoughts. And this complete stranger and I began talking about everything”</p>
<p>What William was trying to say, and maybe because of embarrassment or something else as vague as male ego, he couldn't find the words to. He was all the time recently trying to see how Daniel would see things. He had slowly developed an intense respect of him, a kind of respect that is usually cultivated over years of friendship and understanding. And that was why he must be feeling so powerless right now talking about these things that happened to him. Because he was constantly thinking about Daniel, in every daily action and everything he did. He even talked to his women about Daniel.</p>
<p>One of them, he didn't remember if it was Samantha or one of the other ones. She said that she wished she was Daniel, instead of her, because he sounds like he's in love with this guy called Daniel. </p>
<p>Ah, it must be Charlotte, it would be something she would say.</p>
<p>“I look around at a place, and I formulate the place and how things work, the system, people spending a ton of money. I'm thinking like you would, without realizing it myself. I'm fitting myself into the world in ways that you would. He could say a whole lot more but it would get awkward.</p>
<p>“Why would you do such a thing” Daniel said.</p>
<p>“Because after doing this, for the first time I'm not being treated like dirt, I'm respected by my peers, I found my niche.”</p>
<p>“You have your place in this world” Daniel said, “Without having to be me. Just have some confidence. I don't know what you're talking about, you're not treated bad at all, it's just that you always come to me to complain about how you are being mistreated that you're a victim. But actually you're the same as everyone else. After a while living in the same place and surrounded by the same things, we all become the same, all our differences start to harmonize like one big wave instead of tiny differences vibrating against each other. No matter what, you complain, the conversation always goes to it. If there was a planet of dogs, to each dog the other dogs would look so different and completely strange. ”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” William asked.</p>
<p>Daniel had his finger on a touchscreen and was scrolling something instead of talking to him. “I'm scrolling through names” He put the touchscreen aside and looked up, “...All the names of the contributors for this hotel” he held the screen up, showing all the names, rows and rows of obscure names that kept scrolling down. “These names are the names of people who have contributed to this hotel, they sponsor it in its everyday actions. I'm writing some of them down”</p>
<p>“Why have you got that?”</p>
<p>“Because these are the people we're stealing from, some of them are innocent, others are guilty as fuck, but they're all unique.”  The topic changed smoothly, like the change in direction of an air conditioner.</p>
<p>William stared at the names, and after some time he started to see them as just words together, some weird ones as well, all just statistics. He couldn't believe how each of them was a person with their own experiences and ways of viewing the world. From here they looked so pathetic and weak.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry looked around, the skin on his neck twisted like sandpaper, “I'm crafting and assembling a team. We're stealing from real people, they are people with their own ideals as well.”</p>
<p>It struck William like a stroke, “I never thought of it like that.” he said. He always thought of the heist with a personal guilt, that he was doing something bad, but he never realized that he was actually destroying the lives of others around him. They were using their hard-earned money and investing in the hotel for a good cause, for the enjoyment of these visitors to these glorious place. What right did they have to take what their belongings?</p>
<p>“I stopped thinking about it long ago. Three or four years now” Daniel lay back on the sofa like an armpiece. “People talk about robberies like they're no good, the people who do them have no morals. And I don't know, they're probably right. But after a certain point you don't care about that anymore, it's pure survival that matters. I need this heist to make me money so I can support my dreams. You need it for your own desires, Mr. Lazy told me he was doing it to support his wife, so they can buy a big house with a trampoline and a swimming pool for their children in the future, and so he would look good in front of his friends.”</p>
<p>“That's stupid” William said, “I don't understand that reason”</p>
<p>“A lot of people would say that, because it's not them” William sat up, he grabbed the hem of his housekeeping uniform, there were new stains on it, a slight darker grey than the uniform. “All of us housekeepers are the same, do you know how?”</p>
<p>“Because...you have the same job? Is this a trick question?”</p>
<p>“No, because we all feel like we've been fucked over. We work so many hours and hardly get any money, so we're angry all the time”</p>
<p>“But the housekeepers are the loudest at the staff meals and at the parties.”</p>
<p>“They have to be loud to be heard by others. A lot of us are angry, but we look around and don't have anyone to blame. Our bosses are working harder than us, and they have so much pressure to have the rooms done in time, we're already understaffed as it is, so we have to work overtime. The guests in the room are nice to us and friendly, and they're thankful for the work we do. The staff meals are shit, but they're not bad, and living conditions are good. But the job itself has this anger, and we don't know where to direct it, we need someone to blame. I've got steam coming out of me constantly.”</p>
<p>“So you're blaming the GM?”</p>
<p>Daniel looked at William, William shrunk under his gaze like a <strong><em>_</em></strong>(sea urchin or something) that you put your finger in and closes up. He had forgotten how scary this man could be. It was a part of William's respect for him, his admiration included fear.</p>
<p>“No one is my boss, I don't want to be bossed around by anyone” Daniel said. “All of us humans are born equal, correct? SO how come I have to spend a certain number of hours of my day being bossed around by some...Gorilla with a badge!”</p>
<p>“You're scaring me” William said. “Why would you say such a thing? I thought you were here because you wanted to steal.”</p>
<p>“I never wanted to at first, but my anger grew and grew until this heist was the only action that could satisfy me anymore.” Daniel was smiling back now, like he was talking about sweets, or candies and heaven.</p>
<p>What made it worse for William was when he heard what came next. “Then I found other people, just like me, who were also upset, and who have the talents and skills and the raw courage to do something about it. So I hired you guys one by one, like a chef looks over his spices and chooses the appropriate ones. Do you know what colour courage is? It's red. You  never asked me why I hired you as opposed to all the other people here.”</p>
<p>It made William feel like he was in the same league as this man. It was flattering, but also disturbing. Was he such an angry person as well? Or was it only Daniel who saw it that way.</p>
<p>In some ways what Daniel was proposing was more cowardly than everyone else.</p>
<p>It was becoming awkward, William was feeling weird, he didn't know how he felt about this, yet. Daniel was on the touchscreen again, and William had no idea what Daniel was thinking, whether this conversation was normal for him, or was it something profound as well?</p>
<p>He acted like it was nothing special.</p>
<p>Daniel kind fo disappeared into the corner with his touchscreen. William saw that he was playing with maps and figuring things out. His fingers were strong and looked capable, and able to do a lot of things with them. But William wodnered that if this was Daniel's life, is this all he did? Did he not do anything else with his life other than plan out this heist? Did he have any interests of hobbies outside it? Because if the hesit didn't work...if it failed, then what else did Daniel have left? </p>
<p>Only anger.</p>
<p>Two more guys came in, from the looks of it they had just finished work. One was wearing his uniform, another had his uniform over his shoulder, they both looked exhausted and held boxes of beers as medication. “We got our days off” they said immediately before anyone asked. “Do you want any days off? We'll give you some.”</p>
<p>They started talking about work and joking and complaining. After a few minutes one of them turned to William with confusion in his eyes. “I heard you're dating like three girls, but one of them's Charlotte right?”</p>
<p>“No, no” William shook his head. But then he thought about Charlotte and how she would be hurt if he denied it. “I mean yes, why?”</p>
<p>“That girl's the craziest psycho bitch” William heard, then the guys started complaining about her. “My friend, he's a good dude, real honest as well, she took his room key and won't give it back, she sometimes locks his door and locks herself in there, in his room” The guy's tone was really upset, like it had happened to him first hand. “She does perverted things in his room, and when she finally gives him back the key to his own room, he goes back in and it smells so bad, or smells so good whichever way you roll.”</p>
<p>“Is this Charlotte? Like the one that works at reception”</p>
<p>“There's no other Charlotte here mate, sorry to disappoint you.” The guy paused, midway through his drink, he put it back on the table. “Man, I guess you never saw that side of her.”</p>
<p>The Charlotte William knew was calm and composed, and really thoughtful and feeling everything intensely. She was also extremely beautiful and gentle. She was wholly dedicated to William, he had never even thought of her being with a different guy. Let alone doing such crazy things. </p>
<p>“To everyone else she's a normal and respectable girl, but when she meets my friend...”</p>
<p>“Which friend is this?” William jutted in.</p>
<p>“He's called Alexis, he's the new porter, apparently he's 'good looking' and all the girls are digging him. Him and Charlotte have been hooking up for a while. But you know, he's my friend, he's a good guy he helped me out and I helped him out, I don't think of it much, just that he's popular, he gets a few more girls than I do, but hey that's life, and he's also human and struggles with his lfie as well you know.”</p>
<p>“What were you saying about her?”</p>
<p>“He's keen” The other guy said, he had been drinking the whole time, he was bored and tired. </p>
<p>“I can only tell you what my friend said, I met the girl, but she was pleasant and sweet, yeah, kind of like you said, but my friend, Alexis,  said that when the two of them are together, she's always complaining and demanding sex and he grows tired after a while.”</p>
<p>There was no way this could be Charlotte they were talking about. The Charlotte that William had climbed the hill together with, and gazed at the stars togetehr with, and flirted in the store with. This was his Charlotte, not some other girl he didn't care about.</p>
<p>“Some guys like her, they hear her complaints and see love, and they respect her opinions and be lucky to have her. But my friend's had enough. They were just friends with benefits, but even that is becoming tiring he said.”</p>
<p>“You know, her lips are the best” he said.</p>
<p>“Her lips?” William said. </p>
<p>“Yeah, she's been here for a while, and she would sleep around with all the guys, but when it got her ignored by other guys, she stopped. She was being used.”</p>
<p>“That's kind of horrible” William said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and when she started getting ignored by the other guys, she stopped. She told everyone she was being used”</p>
<p>“You said that already”</p>
<p>“The dumb bitchtook a long time to find out, and when she finally did, she was all loose and worthless.”</p>
<p>Now William knew what he felt, he was shocked at the way these men talked about her. He felt personally offended. </p>
<p>He realized he must like her.</p>
<p>Later at night, Charlotte rejected him when he texted her after work. He wanted to know what she was doing, and whether she had time to hang out. For some reason he was extremely curious about her.</p>
<p>But after she rejected him, he felt really alone at this time of the night. Loneliness set in when the sun set and the world became a quiet place, and it was too dark to be able to see anyone else. He sat at the bench and felt like tearing up, before knowing anything the sadness started to overwhelm him. He scrolled through the contacts on his phone, looking for someone he could contact now, someone who would get with him at the drop of a dime, someone not very fussy. He scrolled to the bottom and realized that was it, there was no one.</p>
<p>He saw one of the other popular girls who worked somewhere. She wore a restaurant uniform and had talked to him a couple of times. Her uniform had a bit of brown stain on the side, it looked like tomato juice that had gone dry. He asked her straight up if she wanted to make out. This girl, she looked around, from sideways her face looked like the Great Wall of China. Because everyone was gone she said yes and they made out. Her breasts were bigger and her hips were narrower, she moved like a crazy animal, licking all over him like he was the bottom of a dessert plate. One thing about her he rememebred was that she was desperate for his kisses, she asked him to kiss her on her neck, and on her earlobe, and on her armpit, and on her eyebrow, and then beneath delicate layers of clothing. But after twenty minutes of this, she sat back and removed herself from him.</p>
<p>“What's up?” William surfaced, he looked like a diver who had come back from an excursion, he was sweaty and short of breath.</p>
<p>“Let's go to my room” she said. She was wet, and he was hard. They were both like ripe fruits that would soon expire. </p>
<p>“What about your girlfriend?” She led him by the hand, he held on and walked after her, sensing the urgency in her voice. Every word was pronounced like it was something pleasurable, he watched her thighs move, they were so fit, and he couldn't stop wanting to grab her and hold her. </p>
<p>“She's in her room”</p>
<p>“You sick man” she turned and looked at him, he saw she was smiling, like it was a turn on. He reachedover to grab her ass, it was firm, he pinched it. Then she stopped in front of a door. Leaning forward with her head, she looked down at her toes, her striped socks, and gave a big sigh. It was a sigh that was desperate, she needed to have him right then.</p>
<p>They got to her room and William ripped off her jeans, she had her hands on the bed and was looking at him with eyes that demanded he hurry up. He loosened the button off her grey jeans and undid the zip, her underwear was showing, it was light red, he touched it and she immediately swore, like he had pressed a button on a big complicated mahcine. “Fuck, hurry up already”</p>
<p>He smoothe dhis fingers out over her stomach and she glared, she pushed back with her elbows off the bed until her jeans came off and her slim legs uncovered themselves from the jeans. He grabbed one and seaparated it, smelling her sweet scent. </p>
<p>She picked him up and took him to her room. It was pink and nice. She threw the soft toys off and her computer lying diagonally on the floor, halyway through a movie, and the power light still flashing on and off, on and off.</p>
<p>Her satin top came loose immediately, he ran his hands underneath in the paradise, exploring the ridges and valleys.</p>
<p>This woman was so hungry that it was like he was taking a driving test for the first time, and in the back was a tiger he had to tame at the same time. He guessed that this woman was as horny as a rhinocerous, or a thorn bush, and she needed to be serviced properly, or she woudln't run well the next day. She was fortunate, or unortunate in that regard. As he drove himself into her, he wondered how many guys she had been with and what number he was, and with each thrust she grew less and elss attractive, like his glasses were fogging up or something. Her boobs bounced up and down, and they excited him, but as soon as he came, his focus changed and they looked like a deflated ball. He shrunk out of her, and she sat up, immediately going over to do her hair, and then clean herslef off. The soft toys were thrown all around the room. And he wondered what her parents would think of her, she was taught to respect her body, but look whats he was doing. And he wasn't even attratced anymore. </p>
<p>She turned to him, with a look that said What are you still doing here?.</p>
<p>She told him a story about an apple tree her family had, but it never grew apples, it didn't grow anything of value. “I told Mom that was because it wasn't an apple tree, it was a mango tree. And sure enough mangoes were everywhere when she opened her eyes and just looked.”</p>
<p>Basically. What she was saying by telling this story, was that she was bored of him and would like him to leave. </p>
<p>Afterwards she lay in bed rolling around like a tyre, she still wasn't satisfied with herself, that person was not satisfying either, so she went out and found the next person. It was a girl, and she brought the girl back to her room to do it again. She thought that another girl might be more comforting for them both as they adapted to each other's needs better. They just touched each other and the other guys ran away, scared.</p>
<p>Then she took the girl to her room. It was almost 3am, everyone was dead asleep, not a single person was walking around, the hallways smelled of old shower soap and must. They looked like they were always empty without a soul anywhere in the building ever. The girl led this other girl past, she was heated up inside like a fireplace, she needed someone to feel her. And she wanted someone close to hug for the night.</p>
<p>“I never knew you were gay” the girl she was leading hesitated on her pull and went back to being soft and reserved. Afetr the daytime came, no one would know what was happening here.</p>
<p>After five minutes of rolling on their bed, getting something started, the other girl pulled her bra back down, she found her socks and panties on the ground. “It's not working” she said, “I'm not feeling it” She picked up her mobile phone and her uniform, then scattered off. She stopped at the doorway and turned around, there was a spring inbher step that hadn't been there earlier. “Thanks though, that was...interesting.”</p>
<p>“I'm human” the girl said, focused on the task at hand, which was the fire in her loins which she had to smoulder. She had spent the past few hours in demand, and now was needing the relief.</p>
<p>“You know, if anyone knew you were like this...” The girl stopped in front of the door, like a guest, or like an observer walking through a museum and stopping at a work of art. She judged it with a keen eye, “Don't let yoruself become too perverted, you won't achieve anything else in life”</p>
<p>“Like what”</p>
<p>“You have to stop ringing the doorbell and go and open the door.” </p>
<p>The next day at work, the girl saw the guy she was with last night. He looked soggy, like a donut drooped in water, it was edible, but the ride was going to be nasty. She regretted it, her jeans were slim, she had guys looking at her, they tried to be subtle but it was obvious. She knew what they wanted, and she regretted giving it to such a dirty guy. He didn't even smile whiel he worked.</p>
<p>William was daydreaming. He spent the gruelling hours at work imagining scenarios, observing his customers and thinking about having sex with them. He was slowly growing crazy and so depressed. Something here to connect to the girl, and contrast </p>
<p>Some people said he had a good job and was popular with everyone, he was well liked because he laughed a lot. But he was also uncontrollably depressed sometimes. It was random, these hours just came unprecedentedly, he could do anything, but the mood swings changed like the weather. He thrust himself into his job to make it fall away.</p>
<p>After work he scrolled through his contacts. One girl asked him to contact her, he met her at the staff party briefly, but he knew she took a liking to him. He didn't know why, but she did. So he called her. She answered and said yes he could come over.</p>
<p>This girl was moaning beneath him like an ambulance alarm, she was so fucking loud that he had to hold one ear shut as he thrust into her. And she was so tight that his dick felt like it was being bent. She liked it rough, apparently, and kept asking him to go harder and faster. She was on all fours on the bed, leaning over with her hands grabbing the covers on the side of the bed. Her fingers were small and smooth, she could hardly grab on, and her body was small like an apple or something that came in a fruit basket. But she kept asking for it harder and harder, until she was bouncing like a basketball on the bed, her hair was flying everywhere like she was spinning like an iceskater. Her legs were on either side of him, spread out wide, the toes were clenched and dealing with the stress. Her butt cheeks were like the surface of a small bowl of water, rippling back and forth. From this angle he couldn't see her tits, and he wanted to see them. He stopped and spun her around, she moved around like a screwdriver until she was facing him. The glorious tits were in front of him they said 'hi'. Her feet moved and started digging under the bottom of the bed, she looked at him, then out the window, then to her legs, then back at him. She kept repeating this, checking him, checking the environment outside, then at her own figure. Her interests rotated between these three things. William was moving in and out, she kept asking for more. He was holding onto her breasts like they were the handles of a motorcycle. When he pinched the nipples at the tip, she screamed and accelerated. “Fuck me!” </p>
<p>There were two raspy knocks on the door, it clearly came from outside. William hesitated, his dick even started shrinking. But she pulled him back in, “Don't stop, fuck these people” She moved her hands over his abdomen, then on his arms, feeling the muscle. She put his hands on her breasts and moved them around. “Do you like them?” He grabbed the nipples and twisted them, it was like honking the horn, and he revved the engine, the motocycle speeds up to an insane pace. The truck horn was so loud. Her eyes widened in shock, and she started banging herself against him. The bed hit the wall like a jackhammer and the light swung back and forth above them, making the light of the room pulse through and making their shadows move everywhere.</p>
<p>This girl was out of control.</p>
<p>A female voice came from outside “Kate, shut the fuck up, every single fucking night, people have to work tomorrow”</p>
<p>Kate struggled, she had to make a decision, she looked at the three things again then wrapped her leg around to slip off the dick. She took one of the announcements from her work and chucked it over his prick. Then she groaned and went over to the door.</p>
<p>Before openeing the door she turned back pointing to the guy, then at his dick. “Don't move one step, I'm coming back to get more”</p>
<p>Kate opened the door and saw the woman standing in front of the door, flustered. She was angry enough that her face was turning red, she needed to sleep, but she coudln't when Kate fucked like a tornado every second night. </p>
<p>Somehow after a few minutes Kate also convinced this woman to join them. She sighed, she stood a the doro for a while, starign in the room, looking back down the hallway to her own. Her legs were crossed, and she was barefoot. Her pyjamas were easy release and clip on. Her hair was in a makeshfit knot which she could retie in a more aesthetic way in the morning. </p>
<p>William realized this woman was Dina, the receptionist. She was always dressed up and pretty at work, but right now she was unprepared, she looked completely different. At work she had a smooth dress that was ironed shut, a blouse underneath that was carefully buttoned, and tucked into her skirt. Her skirt was black and round and tight that it made pull marks sideways, and she wore stockings that were as black as the night sky.</p>
<p>But right now she was a mess. She walked over, she recognized William as well, a bit of a surprise running down her face, but her gaze quickly moved to his dick. It was hard, and it was attractive. She leaned her head back, “What the hell” and undid the knot, her hair fell around her like a willow tree, and she unbuttoned the bottom buttons of her nightgown. </p>
<p>“That's it” the naked woman said, “Enjoy life a bit” Her hips were wide and bare, there were different tan lines that ran across that made her look like a tiger. But her face was smiling as she pulled her cheeks wide.</p>
<p>Dina stood against a desk, and tiredly stepped backward, keeping her palms on the desk, she went diagonally lower, she watched her feet, then leaned forward, having her butt out. She looked back, “Hurry up” she said.</p>
<p>William felt offended at beign treated like some quick taste at a restaurant. But his dick twitched and moved like a monster, and he was drawn to her, he lifted her gown up and the goods were stored there. He was getting so tired now, he was falling asleep. But they went at it relentlessly.</p>
<p>Dina left immediately after she had enough, and that was a few minutes in, she just kind of leaned back forward and made him take his dick out of her, then she buttoned her gown up from the bottom to the top and stepped away, giving a subtle smile that could mean whatever the fuck anything to an unsuspecting man creature. “Thank you, it was nice meeting you” she said, like he was a stranger, and someone she would not like to meet again. Or like she had just had the most amazing time of her life and was too shy to admit it.</p>
<p>During the day, William sat in the cafe imagining what happened last night, it was amazing. But he felt further from the women he already knew, those who held him dearly.
At the cafe were all sorts of people, but very different to the staff he worked with. Kids were running around the tables, or sitting boredly, going through their phones while their parents looked up at the beautiful mountain that had revealed itself between the clouds. It looked like a majestic staircase stretching up into the sky, and if you followed it up you would go to heaven.</p>
<p>A couple started kissing, standing close together and kissing more and more freuqently and passionately. The man eventually grabebd the woman by the waist and led her away.</p>
<p>Two adults were telling their kids something, and the kids swallowed whatever it was without any hesitation. Information was all included. William saw two young women walk in, joined by a third at the counter, they wore similar clothing, tight black jeans that hugged their figure like a koala hugging a tree, he belived that if he took their jeans and pulled far enough he could make a trampoline. Then he imagiend taking those pants off, feeling the curves over their shirt, just rubbing the knob with the bottom of his palm, and feeling her curves. He imagined her looking at him right now and walking away with him, asking him to come around, or to just talk to her normally.</p>
<p>He found himself thinking these erotic things in this normal innocent cafe. The scenery was magnificent, but he was growing desperate.</p>
<p>The couple started talking, and form the way he was trying to explain, and her body language looking around and fiddlign with her hands, drawing away slightly, she had lost interest, or was disappointed in what he was saying, it looked like he was reprimanding her and demanding her to do things. Their kisses quickly led to arguments.</p>
<p>“That's what I'm trying to do” he said. “But you keep yelling at me, becoming frustrated”</p>
<p>He elft to take a phone call, and now she sat and looked into space, with her arms crossed, non-verbally saying that she was fine, but she was distraught, the conversation came with a sudden turn, and she looked around to see if anyone was watching.</p>
<p>Children and women were running around him, coffee was being served every minute and family jokes being mentioned with unfunny Dad jokes sitting at the forefront. He was sitting in the corner of the hotel imagining women naked and pleasuring them. Why did he have to think about this now?</p>
<p>Then one of the women walked past, he stared at her butt, how her legs moved, and how she carried herself. He couldn't take his eyes off her. She looked down at her figure to check herself. </p>
<p>And it never happened, he knew, his fantasy was so strong that it blended with the real world.</p>
<p>Then he wondered if this heist was actually happening, or was it also a dream.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thirty-nine-jeena-dreaming">thirty nine: Jeena Dreaming</h3>
<p>I finally found a solution to how to deal with all of the unwritten things that I haven't done anything with. I'm going to do it Orwell style and put it in a book, then the story needn't be so long, and yet it can still be informative!! It's kind of like cheating, but who gives a fuck anyway haha.</p>
<p>Charlotte already knew about it, it shouldn't be a big deal anymore, but when she heard it again, her soul dropped further down.</p>
<p>Charlotte was fine five minutes ago, she had just finished a big bout of customers and was coming out to the staff dining with a jump for her ten minute break, when one of the other girls who talked a lot politely and considerately informed her of how she had heard how Charlotte's boyfriend had been cheating. As the girl described it, Charlotte sat in the chair opposite the girl and felt each word sink into her like a large bell wringing her insides out.  She flinched with each word describing  a betrayal and sexual escapade that went beyond her imagination. It was guttering and if she could hear it, it would sound like a scream like the one from that picture. And she didn't want to hear any more, but she kept listening, partly because it was difficult to stop a talking girl, partly because it was the sheer culture of politeness, and partly because once the conversation stopped, she would be drowned in her own thoughts of worthlessness and lack of faith.</p>
<p>She took the second half of her break walking to the hangout area, she didn't know it, but to passersby she looked like a zombie, a hot zombie.</p>
<p>Her roommate was in their room, so she found a step and collapsed on it with her head in her arms and crouching down. </p>
<p>As soon as she cried afterwards, a guy walks past and asks if she is okay </p>
<p>“I'm fine”  she barely managed to say.  And it sounded like a croak.</p>
<p>He immediately sensed that he had come across a calamity, he stopped and came back, “Really? Can I do anything to help?”</p>
<p>“Fuck off” Charlotte waved him away like a fly, but with vehemence. And he went, now he was upset as well. She said it like dog food that she just threw out onto a tray somewhere, and he was only trying to help.</p>
<p>After Charlotte's break was over and she was back in work with reddened eyes and the absence of a smile, she thought about it and felt a little bad about it, but two seconds later  she was thinking of William again. The horror story, the worst scenario she had only ever heard about had happened, how would she survive this? She felt permanently broken, like she would never recover. And worst of all she wanted to hug someone, but the person to hug wasn't there.</p>
<p>At work, William was listening to Jeena. He had been flriting with Jeena all day, they had the same work schedule, and he was asking her about her life, and she was beginning to talk about the men she had ploughed through. Jeena couldn't help bragging about it, she loved to talk about herself.</p>
<p>William couldn't help looking at her, she was exotic, and something new, he had fucked her before, but once wasn't enough for him. And he knew if he had a bit of time he could take her again. The ring on her finger only made her more attractive.</p>
<p>“I told my husband I had a really weird dream” she said, wiping the counter with a cloth, it had glass cleaner on it and took the fingerprints of the customers off, leaving it brand new.</p>
<p>“And?” William was standing at the cashier with his hands behind his back, ready to engage a customer with his bright optimistic attitude and highly experienced sales pitch that would convince any customer that they needed to buy whatever that didn't need..</p>
<p>“I'll tell you” she said, “But don't tell anyone else”</p>
<p>“Why, are you embarrssed?” William said.</p>
<p>“No”</p>
<p>“Yes you are”</p>
<p>“Shut up, I'm not saying it anymore.”</p>
<p>“Did you see that guy who walked past earlier?” William said, “He was with a really young chick”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Aren't you interested?”</p>
<p>“Not really”</p>
<p>“Fuck” William said, “You're still embarrassed?”</p>
<p>“I'm not embarrassed, I never was, besides you know you can't swear here, I'll report it to Black”</p>
<p>“I”ll tell others we had sex” William said.</p>
<p>Now Jeena was embarrassed, she dropped the topic immediately and consumed herself in work.</p>
<p>“Tell me the story” William said.</p>
<p>“I'm not telling you shit” Jeena said, “I toldyou I'm not telling you anymore”</p>
<p>“You said you would though”</p>
<p>“Fine, okay” She changed her mind so freely. </p>
<p>“Was it good?”</p>
<p>“Get over it” Jeena said. She pointed to the picture of a sports athlete, “When he saw a huge high jump, he had to get to the other side, so guess how he did it?”</p>
<p>“Uh, he jumped?”</p>
<p>“He just got over it” Jeena laughed and pushed William away.</p>
<p>“Fuck you”</p>
<p>“Okay, listen” Jeena said, “This dream is perverted so you'll love it”</p>
<p>“Wait, let me say something first” William said. He had a dream about the heist, about the trial run, and he didn't know why, but he wanted to express it to her. Maybe he was curious to see hwo she would respond, or if she would listen and understand? Maybe he just needed to talk to anyone right now.</p>
<p>“So I got diarrhea” William said.</p>
<p>“Is that how you start a story?” Jeena said. But she was smiling and her working pace had slowed.</p>
<p>“It's really weird” he said. “I got diarrhea and couldn't go to work easily, and it messed up the whole trial. I was practicing this thing with my friends, close friends that we had been together for a year for, and we're practicing for this upcoming test, but I can't make it, and they're all relying on me. I'm lying in bed with the curtains closed and the light filtering in through the thin material, it's got a big orange glow behind it. I felt like I was dying, I had no interest in the things I usually cared about, and mortality was standing outside the window, coming in soon. I was too tired to pick up a book and read, or to fall asleep, had to keep mocing and changing positions in the bed. And I felt like my life up to now that I lived and loved was all a big waste and leading to nothing, that I had been focusing on the wrong things this whole time.”</p>
<p>“That might be what dying feels like for some” Jeena said.</p>
<p>“One of my team members came to visit me in my room. I'm lying in bed looking pathetic, I've got a bag beside me for my diarrhea, because if I move too much it all comes out in chunks, like a bag of potato chips”</p>
<p>“Uhh, TMI??” Jeena closed her eyes and laughed.</p>
<p>“My friend tells me I'm fine. To him I must look fine. We're all bad people, all criminals, but we're supporting each other and really helpful to each other. But the result is that we hate all outsiders, it's the irony of community. I ask him why I get diarrhea, I don't know why I ask, it's such a strange question, but he answers as if it's normal. Dreams are weird. He tells me it's because I can't stop my f**** mouth from swallowing the cake!” That's all he says, but I know what he means.”</p>
<p>“What does it mean?” Jeena felt old, was that why she didn't understand some of the lingo these kids used?</p>
<p>“It means I'm swallowing her cum, every night, because I got a new girlfriend, that's what they were trying to say. But then it isn't dairy free, so I got diarrhea and flatulence.”</p>
<p>“Oh” That was a lot more perverted than she expected. </p>
<p>“They say things like, He has her for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then has icecream for dessert. He doesn't allow her to eat any meat or fish, because it makes her taste bad. So she only eats spinach and cheese.” William shrugged, “I know, weird right?”</p>
<p>“Actually” Jeena grinned, she pushed her arms againsgt her thighs and stood up, “I may or may not have a similar story?”</p>
<p>“You have one? Maybe?”</p>
<p>“It depends on whether you will laugh at me or not”</p>
<p>“I promise I won't, or I will, if that's what you want me to do”</p>
<p>“No, don't” She looked down at the ground and her heyelashes flitted around like a moth or sparrow. She looked everywhere but at him. He kept staring at her eyelashes, maybe waiting for one to drop to the ground, or a new one to grow out. He didn't know why, but they were fascinating, he was like a baby staring at a mother, or an attractive human that ahd entered its life.</p>
<p>“Whenever anyone comes over to our house for dinner and asks me what I eat, what my normal day to day diet consists of, my husband tells me how to answer, he has planned it out for me already.”</p>
<p>“That's cool, what do you say?”</p>
<p>“I tell them I have my husband, then these guests, they all look at each other awwardly and laugh, until they realize I'm serious, and it's even more awkward.” Jeena said this humorous thing without a sense of ludicrous, she was inflamed by it. Because in her heart somewhere,s he felt like she resented getting married without knowing what it was about, and she wished to be young like William and explore life a little bit more before getting the baby factory chugging.</p>
<p>William looked at her, she was working still as she spoke, but what she said revealed a lot about her. It was your own words that hung you in the end. It was so weird because at work she was a completely normal person and really responsible, she didn't tolerate any jokes or wild assumptions. She hardly even laughed, she was very serious and always thinking about the possibilities of what could happen in the shop that had to be prevented.</p>
<p>But he started to see why, and he started to see her for who she really was. And there was nothing more attractive than that. </p>
<p>That night when Jeena got home she dreamed. She was lying beside her husband in bed, she faced up at the ceiling, it looked like the great soundproof wall of struggles in the darkness. What was familiar to her had become strange, it was almost as if there was nothingnedd above her, that was what it looked like. And if she disappeared from the world, she would look like the roof. She turned in her sleep and saw the outline of her dear husband sleeping, he wore a mouthguard to prevent himself from chewing through his own teeth. He had the covers pulled fully over him. And she wondered if she still loved him as she used to. She wanted to turn the light on for things to be a little more normal and less scary like the day time. The dream she had was weird, as all dreams were. And she was still adjusting to life post-dream in this world. </p>
<p>In the dream was a man who never spoke, he smiled a lot and had golden and silver teeth. He nodded to everything she said. And she remembered being really happy, for some reason in the dream she had been extremely lonely, the worst typeof loneliness where you don't even realize you are lonely. And she was desperate to talk to anyone, any human. So she was enjoying his company here and grateful for his presence. She just remembered feeling that if she didn't talk to him now, she might not get the opportunity to talk to another human for years, she might be left in solitude.
The man wrote a sign saying describing how he didn't speak english, or whatever language she was speaking to him, Indonesian, Korean, or jinglish. But he smiled really nicely, and listened to her despite not understanding, so she didn't mind it.</p>
<p>Then when he smiled after she said soemthing, she peered in closer to check what caught her by instinct, surely not she thought. She wondered if the tooth was real silver or a diamond. One of them was purple, he had put nail polish on it. And it was so weird, but she was curious and enticed, and there was no stopping.</p>
<p>The man said something, and she looked up and noticed that he had spoken. The words sounded like vomit. Then he opened his mouth again, and she saw something disgusting that should never exist in this world. She saw that in his mouth was his tongue, and on middle of it, sitting like a sail boat in a vast expanse of ocean, was an eye, and underneath it, a mouth drooling its own saliva, and with its own set of teeth, browned by oxidation. In the middle was a nose. It was a complete face staring back at her inside his mouth, like a little monster that had grown inside this man and was wearing his skin. All over it was scaly skin, half green like mould, with hairy patches all over it. She was so weirded out by it that she leaned back in her chair away from it, she had to hold any vomit back, making sure it wouldn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>The man bowed his head profusely, the message was clear, he was apologetic. He shut his mouth and wrote down that he would never open his mouth in front of her again and would stay mute. </p>
<p>“You don't have to” she said, or something like that, “We won't be friends any longer”</p>
<p>William listend to her round the corner and package the story and finish it. It came to a stop like the rides at the roller coasters which suddenly slowed down dramatically. “That's a fucking weird dream, are you sure you're sane?”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“It's a joke, but for a dream you sure have a lot of detail, I hardly remember my dreams, I mena I remmeber them perfectly, but as soona s I try to describe them they disappear, or they run away every time I word them.”</p>
<p>“You know, the dream was weird”</p>
<p>“I know, I just told you”</p>
<p>“Shut up, let me finish” Jeena said, “The dream was so weird, as you so kindly pointed out. But it wasn't unpleasant, I actually enjoyed it. Anything can happen in a dream and make you feel differently about so many things in real life. And because of the dream, my relationship with my husband has improved drastically, it's hard to explain how, but it just has. It's like a miracle, a gift from Above. And now I know that it's what I'm supposed to do with my life, to serve muy husband, and help the world one step at a time”</p>
<p>She smiled, now she was finished and pleased with what she said, and the message she had described.</p>
<p>“Maybe” William said, picking up some papers and stamping a stock date on them. Then walking around the shelves and checking everything was in stock. “Maybe you had enough of feeding your boyfriend three course meals everyday, that's why you dreamed it.” Jeena fell queit, and he thought about what he said, “It's not a big deal, I just said it spontaneously, no need to think about it.”</p>
<p>Two days later, Jeena was still couldn't stop thinking about it at all.</p>
<p>“How about you?” Jeena said.</p>
<p>“I havent' dreamed in a long time because of a seriosu alck of sleep” William said, “I don'tlet those cunts talk to me in the night”</p>
<p>“Your spirit doesn't whisper your secrets to you” Jeena said. “Doesn't that make you feel lost?” </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your spirit wants you to share your body with sleep, because sleep is when the spirit is abel to talk and think and directs its most loved possession, your body, to its goal, your soul.”</p>
<p>“You mean I need to sleep more?” William said, “You're telling me the same message that hundreds of others before you have reiterated to me since the beginning of time.”</p>
<p>“After a long time” Jeena said, “You don't notice it instantly, but it creeps upon you slowly, but your life is ruined, because you haven't slept well in such a long time, and the mental state degrades and becomes simple, concentration disappears. You get anxious easily and worry about the smallest things, your sleep rhythm becomes permanently destroyed. </p>
<p>William worried about the heist a lot recently. What if he had ruined his lie, he still had to do things.</p>
<p>He decided to change the topic, it was too painful talking about this.</p>
<p>“But I'm lucky I have agood hsuband, and you'll find a good wife” Jeena said, “Trust me”</p>
<p>She signed out of work and left William to clean up. The last customers in the store were an elderly couple who had wandered in afetr just finishing dinner. They were going for a walk and bonding, she was looking all over the jewellery, had her hands on the things she could touch, and her cheeks pasted to the jewellery stored in the glass. Her husband had his hand on his wallet and his other hand in his pocket, ready to fund the soon to come expenses.</p>
<p>They both talked about their work the whole time, they were interested in each other's days. And when they argued they supported each other.</p>
<p>Pillow scene.</p>
<p>William told the girl he was with that night about the conversation, he changed the name and dates out, but told basically the same story, he wanted to know what others would think. The girl was panting beside him like a dog. She kept telling him how she had been looking for a boyfriend, and went to social events to find someone special like him. </p>
<p>They had met on the street outside a aprty and gotten talking, he brought her back for sex, and it was so good that she kept coming back for more, he knew that soon she would ask him if he wanted to be exclusive.</p>
<p>The girl was amazed by the story, he watched her stomach rise and fall, and her breasts move about on her chest like jelly. Her stomach was thin but muscular, her bra was dark red, matching with her underwear. She had bought it because her previous boyfriend asked her to wear something 'sexier'.</p>
<p>She kept the covers over her lower body, she didn't like to keep it all out in the open. But she lay there and stared up at the roof, still panting. This was the only fast breathing she did, this was the closest to exercise and sports that she ventured. This room was nice, she would like to live here.</p>
<p>As William told the story, she reached out with her left hand, it was small and smooth, and she ran her fingers down his stomach, and onto his cock which stood firm again. She gripped it and moved her hand up and down slowly, like she was having a conversation with it. It was attractive, she was drawn to it like a painter was to a painting, or a womanizer to woman, or water to gravity. </p>
<p>“I'm amazed” the girl said, “This guy and his tongue, is he really skilled?”</p>
<p>“You want to try it as well?” he said, sensing what she wanted. Her hand was on his dick, of course he knew. She kept pumping up and down, and he groaned here and there where the script allowed. </p>
<p>“Do you think that guy would like to use it on me as well?”</p>
<p>“You mean lick your pussy?”</p>
<p>“Yes” she laughed, covering her mouth with both hands, the stench of his dick was next to her mouth. She put her hand back on his cock, it had hardened and grew taller.</p>
<p>“Any guy would like to lick your pussy” William said, and he felt guilty saying something so dusgusintg, when during the day he talked politely to customers, and he was surrounded by good people. “He would do so immediately if you let him.”</p>
<p>“Even a married man”</p>
<p>“There's no marriage in sex, if you spread your legs a man will be there before I can snap my fingers”</p>
<p>This was news to her, she had always knew men were philanderers, but not to this extent. She opened her legs, and almost instinctively, William crouched down and ran his tongue over her thighs. He played around with the lips before licking her. She moved suddenly, like an animal, and let out a sudden shriek.</p>
<p>“Does your girlfriend know about this?” she asked in the middle of his licking. She felt like an ice cream or something. If he stopped licking she would leak all over his bed. He dug his tongue deep into her and twisted it around, she held his head and pulled him in, this was fun. Right now this was heaven. </p>
<p>“She will one day, it's not good what we're doing here, it's betraying her trust.” he had stopped and looked up, the ice cream was all around his lips, he looked so naughty, and she saw his dick poking out beneath him, she wanted him to put it inside her right now. She was so hot inside, and only this could satisfy her.</p>
<p>“She's just another girl, who cares” Anything she said at that moment would be the same. He shrugged for a second, thinking about it, then went on. Whatever.</p>
<p>In the morning she woke up. She knew it was the morning because of the colour of the light outside. And she was naked, but she didnt' know what happened, which part of it was a dream and which part of it was real. As her eyes and ears woke up, she became more embarrassed, and she heard the door knocking. She tilted her head on the soft pillow and saw the door vibrating, people outside were calling out and knocking. They talked to each other about the room being empty. Was this really happening? Was it true?</p>
<p>She fell asleep shortly after, never knowing who was knocking at the door. And if the door opened, she never saw who it was.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-william-meets-the-foreign-girl">forty: William meets the Foreign Girl.</h3>
<p>Elizabeth, who was always emotinally cold and distant at work, felt like writing a poem after coming home from work one time. And so she did. Before starting this job she had a lot of hobbies, so many that she could call herself wealthy, but with the advent of this job, her passions slowly diminished day by day, like the trickle of a tap that wasn't completely turned off.</p>
<p>But on this day off, it was nice weather outside, and the mountains looked attractive, like steps leading her closer to enlightenment. The natural world was right there for her to touch, but she stayed inside. She sat down and wrote in her computer, and she wrote and wrote until she looked up and it was dark. There were a few missed calls on her phone, and the stars were out. It was raining outside and people were bustling past outside her room. She looked back at the screen with tired eyes and disappeared into her world again. She was becoming truly fulfilled. She wrote it out in perfection, then at around midnight she turned on her light, it was bright, and she started reading whats he wrote, word for word.</p>
<p>How many shores must I cross before I recognize a shore.
How many cannons must fly before we will call it a war.
How many rains must fall before we drown in the sea,
How many animals must die before we will finally let them be. 
How many people must suffer before a change can be seen.
How much progress do humans need to feel redeemed?</p>
<p>How many times can I cast a spell, before it stops working and others stop listening.</p>
<p>To her, the poem was very heartfelt and she became sad, but to others it was nothing like that. And she knew this, so before the greatest disappointment arrived, she deleted the poem from her computer and from her memories.</p>
<p>After the poem, Elizabeth lay on the bed with her arms behind her neck, people were working today, and not to work felt so strange, like she was cheating. She felt left out of the main thigns happening in the village, like everyone lived here, and then there was her, on the side and trying. She felt like life was slipping by all around her, like a stone ina  shallow river. She coudln't do anything about it, she couldn't live in it, and no one told her what was happening, or talked to her, or explained to her how she was feeling. She had to work it all out herself. Otherwise, she had nothing to say, because it wasn't important to anyone here. So she just sat in her room today and read for a while and wrote poetry. She remembered hwo her parents loved to read what she wrote, they used to analyze it together after dinner, she brought her newly furnished poem to the table and her parents clapped, then they asked her why she used a certain word and not another, or asked what it meant. And they laughed and cried over it. But here, surrounded by the mountains, no one around her knew about this. No one around her had bothered asking what she did in her spare time, what her talent was, and what she was good at.</p>
<p>And even though she was a supervisor, and she was hard working, she felt this large disconnect, like she was on the other side of a great canyon and overlooking everything that was happening on the other side. She had to cross a huge long single bridge to get to the other side. Everyone else was so popular and doing things, like the new guy William was always with girls and things were happening. And Elizabeth wished that she could be like that as well. But then she became upset with herself that she wasn't more passionate and sincere to her poetry. Her friends from school did it not because they wanted to, but because they had to, to study and pass. But she disliked how she never had the discipline for it.</p>
<p>William was standing at the counter as usual. He was dead bored, and he showed it mercileesly. Erverytime Black walked past he pointed out how William was doing something wrong, and how he should do it better. William nodded and smiled, and they both looked at each other knowing what the other was thinking. Black was frustrated that no matter how many times he repeated it, William wouldn't change, he didn't seem to want to change. And William was frustrated that his boss was such a tight ass and pinpricking all of the weaknesses with minute detail and talking about them as if they were not that big a deal and they didn't bother him at all.</p>
<p>That afternoon, in the mid afternoon, before dinner started, and before the peaceful night fell, William met a woman who was to change his life. If he hadn't been working that day, or if he had been taking out the rubbish, or had been re-stocking the shelves like he was doing msot of the time, and not attending to the counter, or if he had been checking through the stock, or running errands, or taking phone calls from customers in their room, or cleaning the museum near the back, he never would have encountered this woman. </p>
<p>She was standing on the other side of the counter, on first glance he saw nothing special, but that first glance lingered on him and lasted a long time. It was when she spoke that he felt something clicking, like the gears in his body that had never moved before had slowly started to click, like a giant was awakening inside him and propelling him forward into an adventure conquest of enw territory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he could have been here some othert time and possibly met a woman like her, or completely different and fascinating to him as well. No one ever knew what was happening here.</p>
<p>She was a foreign girl, she spoke with an accent, he didn't care where it was from, her eyes looked likeone of the supergiants, and when she looked back at him each time, it was a supernova explosion that messed up the counter with fingerprints. He kept wiping them off as he talked ot her. The conversation wasn't a puzzle, it wasn't a search, it was a tennis game comingback and forth smoothly.</p>
<p>She told him she was travelling with her boyfriend around the country, she usually sat at home and did nothing, but her boyfriend got money saved up and wanted to go somewhere, so they came here, the middle of nowhere, this corner of the globe. Then she joked that she was surprised to travel this far and still see people here. She coudln't believe how far people had travelled, ti was almost as fi she flew ten horus in a plane to come and see more people.</p>
<p>William knew what she meant, that there were too many people and it was mundane. But he didn't say it, because he knew he didn't need to. This was one fo those connections that was hard to describe, but would probably be life changing for the both of them.</p>
<p>“I'm staying in the hostel for three nights here, we, my boyfriend and me, we're climbing all of these mountains. I'm a backpacker now”</p>
<p>The way she said all made him feel sorry for the mountains.</p>
<p>She wasn't quiet, she stood tall and energetic, looking around the store with the eye of Zeus looking for one of his wives after he suspected her of cheating.</p>
<p>Charloote watched from the fireplace. The fireplace was next to the bar, and from it was a safe vantage point into the store, she saw William at work, and working on a cute foreign looking girl. She had tight jeans and was playign with her hair, streaming it like a broom. She was really pretty and of coruse William would eb interested in her. </p>
<p>Charlotte wasn't mad, she was disappointed, and she wondered why she had to like a guy like William when she had so many other guys who wanted to be with her that she kept rejecting.</p>
<p>What made it worse was that William was using the same lines on this girl that he had used on Charlotte. Then this girl made the same expression had when she first heard them. It was like an endearing hug with her eyes for this cute guy who made her heart jump and flutter like a butterfly. Shehad her palms together and on her chest, in worship of his words. Little did she know that they had been rehearsed on woman after woman before she.</p>
<p>William invited her over to his room later that night, and she said no. She smiled and had her hands behind her butt, her legs twisted and facing him playing hard to get. “I can't I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend, I'm staying here with him in the hostel”</p>
<p>“Just for a short time” William said,  “He'll never find out”</p>
<p>Even just mentioning finding out had her scared. William had to press further, “I feel like we clicked, and it's kind of going really well between us right now, do you want to exchange numbers or something?”</p>
<p>She coudln't deny the chemistry, it was like the global discovery of penicillin or something major like that. Later in the night she sneaked out of the hostel room that she and her boyfriendw ere staying in. It was easy because he was from a different bed and was snoring deep in sleep. She felt her jeans and hair in the dark, and she could feel herself growing wet in the depths of the forest, and was surprised at how excited she was. She disappeared out of the room quietly, not allowing herself to make a single sound anywhere. And outside she was running like a typhoon down to the street where she was to meet William. She wanted to see him and hug him and talk to him about everything. This stranger that she had only just met.</p>
<p>It was so late in the night that even the light from the lampposts felt still. They lit up dimly although no one went past, and not a soul was out here. She questioned whether anyone would be here. What she was doing felt so crazy, she had never done anything like this before. She was laughing to herself in the blank space. She miust have looked hysterical from afar. Teh road looked brand new like no one walked throuhg. In the distance was the sound of an avalanche crashing down, the hotel lights were mostly off, and a hare jumped back and forth in the grass, standing on its toes with its ears up high to detect any movement. That was it. Nothign else move, no one talked, and the harshly busy world was dead for a while.</p>
<p>She went down the path, then almost as if it had been planned by fate, he was sitting there with his legs crossed. He looked at her and smiled, making a space beside him for her to sit. And to her suprise, they just began talking. They talked about Freddie Mercury, how he was so full of energy, and he always wanted to things that others couldn't. How his charisma was off the charts. He had Grandiose ideas from his band name to his lifestyle, and they probably were not delusions though.</p>
<p>They shared their opinions freely, like the rain subsiding into the sun and the clouds moving in to rain. There was no intention of sex around him, there was no hard prick leading his way. He was calm and reserved, almost as if her leaving or staying didn't matter. </p>
<p>His composure was extremely attractive.</p>
<p>William was amazed by her thinking process, she was concerned with the same things about Freddie Mercury that he was. People could learn about Mr. Mercury and think about his life, his romances, and watch the same documentaries, yet still be very different people. But she and him were both thinking about his grandiose ideas that probably weren't delusions. They were both that kind of person.</p>
<p>Born to be kings.</p>
<p>They shared his death, And then he died in such a painful and suffering manner, singing a song for his mother at the very end that he improvised, he just asked people to play music, and he would sing anything to it. Why did such a fabulous man have to fall to the pulls of a terrible terminal illness that he coudln't fight evenly. It was an unfiar playing field, he couldn't touch it whiel it slowly tore through his body and destroyed him.</p>
<p>As they talked, William started to wonder if he invited her here to talk about Freddie Mercury or if he was going to make a move on her. Because her perfume was ready, and her necklace had been polished with shoeshine. And she smoothed her skin out so that there wasn't a wrinkle visible, and she laughed in a way that was loud enough to be sensual, and small enough to hide any weakness betrayed in her outburst.</p>
<p>While he wondered this, she started to wonder if he was gay, or if she was just not attractive enough anymore. Or maybe he really did just want to talk, a man who wanted to talk was as rare as finding a polished diamond in the wild.</p>
<p>Then as she watched and listened, he started speaking of profound things that went beyond sex and lust. They were inaccessible to the animal mind. </p>
<p>“Free yourself from the fetters of this world. The chains that are wrapping themselves around you before you realize it.”</p>
<p>Instead of being touched, for some reason she felt judged. Like she was sitting in a big room and being judged by small people in big chairs.</p>
<p>And she wondered if he was trying to teach her how to live her life. She didn't want someone like him to be teaching her how to live her life. There were other more competent people for that. And she also didn't want someone like that moving around inside her. </p>
<p>That was just nasty.</p>
<p>That night they didn't have sex, ands he felt a bit let down, not because she wanted sex, but because her first impression of this man had been wrong, he was holding a lot rmoe emotional baggage. But someone like him probably also had many girlfriends.</p>
<p>She looked up from her hand, her boyfriend was beside her, the one she had known for a while. He woke her up in the morning, and asked her if what she wanted for breakfast. She knew they only had cereal and boiled eggs in their backpacks, but she knew that he would do anything to make a pleasing breakfast for her.</p>
<p>When William walked around work, he saw her, she was always around, getting ready to hike up the mountain with her boyfriend, or preparing to have lunch. Before dinner she wandered around the store. It seemed like she wanted to be in William's vicinity, but with a woman like her, he couldn't be sure. She was close to him one moment, then the next moment she was back to being with her boyfriend and asked William to not say anything.</p>
<p>At night she still came and visited William, even though they didn't do anything, but he felt the sexual energy in her pulsing like an earthquake ready to happen, it could be predicted to what year, or what month, but never to when exactly it would happen. She acted like nothing was wrong, and she wasn't doing anything bad. She would cheat and kiss anything, without remorse, without shame.  She was so casual that William even felt a little jealous. Why coudln't he be like that?</p>
<p>“What's wrong?” she said, stroking his hair.?</p>
<p>“Don't you feel like you're doing something bad?” She was kneeling down beside him, gettign ready to go back. “What if your boyfriend finds out”</p>
<p>“I never thought about it” she said, “Why do you think so much?”</p>
<p>“Why do you think so little? Isn't this something anyone would normally think about?” He was shocked by her absolute lack of morals. </p>
<p>“You can't say that” she said in a twist, “If you were me, you would do the exact same thing”</p>
<p>“Exact?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly, down to every detail and minute, you would do what I am doing. Because I'm living my life in the way that most people would live my life if they were in my shoes, it's the best I can do with what I've been given.”</p>
<p>“The best you can do is to cheat on your boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“Hey, I'm not cheating yet” she said, “But we can if you want to?” She spread her hands, then put them on her hips, showing her willingness to him.</p>
<p>“But don't you think you're doing something wrong? Inherently wrong?”</p>
<p>“Firstly” she said, “What does inherently mean? Secondly, is it okay for me to do this if my boyfriend is cheating as well? Thirdly, it's none of your business, you want me right?”</p>
<p>She was slim, and her legs were long, and her shorts hugged a thigh gap, and she was willing. He could just reach out and touch her anywhere, and she would be under his control. It was too much for a man to walk away from. His fingers were ready, he could do anything and she would enjoy it. He could reach out and put his fingers insider her, he could kiss her, lick her anywhere on her smooth body the colour of a beach. The possiblities were endless. </p>
<p>He used to be a good man, but he understood now, that being in the world and surrounded by all this he couldn't stay the way he was. He was bound to change, like bound to a rock dragging him down. There was no point trying to be a saint.</p>
<p>Then he was shocked at how much of a hypocrite he was. He asked his friend if he was prejudiced. He felt like she was his, she belonged to him after that magical night, but she is back with this other guy, enjoying his pelasure more. Letting him do unspoken of things, and she was an animal with him. That boyfriend was a nobody, a pure pervert with a streak of purple boyfriend material running through his hair. He was dirty and filthy, and she loved it, and had never felt that much pleasure. He was a nobody, but she coudln't hold ehrself back from him. He felt bad that he knew about it.</p>
<p>William gave in, any dignity he had, he threw away. He dreame dof this girl every day, and at night went to see her like a gambler going to the casino straight away as soon as he had a chance, or a drug addict seeing everything as a potential to get money to buy more drugs. He would sell his relationships if he could get more drugs.</p>
<p>He told her about Mr. Angry, he knew he wasn't supposed to, but she wasn't here for a long time anyway. “His real name is unimportant, it can be anything, but he should be called Mr. Angry”</p>
<p>“How about you?” she lay next to him on the pillow, twirling his hair in play. “I'm Mr. Melancholy, it means sad”</p>
<p>“Sad?” she frowned, “Why are you sad”</p>
<p>“It's not that I'm sad, it's just my name, it means sad, the word means sad”</p>
<p>She didn't change expression, “But why is your name that meaning, like melon?”</p>
<p>“It's not melon, it's Mr. Melancholy, there's a Mister in front to show respect”</p>
<p>“Why is it a fruit?” she stopped twirling his hair and moved his hand onto her bare breast, he had been staring at it and slowly growing, as a man. Her nipple was soft, she moved his hand over her body like they were both investigating together. “Melon” she said. But there was no change in her expression. This new sexy foreign girl pronounced it Mr. Melon, like the fruit, and William tried to make her say it properly and ended up going to bed with her. </p>
<p>She moved her hand down, to her folds, and the wriggled his fingers in. “Ask me questions” she said, “And if I can't answer, you punish me” She said it in a way thats he was a bit worried, not about what they were doing, but about her not being able to keep up with him. She was taking english pronounciation to heart.</p>
<p>On the way back from her room, he walked past his room and saw Annalise in there with a knife. She was standing and looking at the mirror with a big chopping knife that could slice an arm or leg with ease. She had gotten it from the kitchen where her friend supported her.</p>
<p>He knocked on the door to his own room timidly. The knocks sounded like creaks in the wood from a natural change rather than a deliberate human action. She came to answer the door with the kinfe in her hand. She elt him in his room and asked him directly, “Why can't you keep your needle sewing the same woman?”</p>
<p>“Calm down” he said, going to the desk next to the window, he had to remind himself that it was his desk. “What are you doing with the knife?”</p>
<p>“I was going to take your dick back with me” she said, “So you can't go around givign it to other women”</p>
<p>“Annalise” he said, “You're my girlfriend, why are you doing this? Don't you love me?”</p>
<p>“Am I?” Annalise finally broke down, the serious face shattered and feelings emerged, real feelings expressing real emotions flooded the room, they weren't as simple as tears and no tears, these were a chemical mixture. A scientist would marvel at te hormones bursting like fireworks in an empty sky.</p>
<p>There was only one way to solve this, so right in front of her, he stripped off and walked behind her, feeling her body through her clothing. The knife dropped to the ground near his feet, and she started moaning in him, moving around, he kneaded her breasts, the breasts he knew so well, and he ran his hands down her waist, sliding his hand in her pants. “You're using me” she said. “Stop it” But she opened her legs wider and gave him more access, they were facing the mirror together, and she could watch herself being pleasured by him. Her hair was covering her mouth, and she leaned forward and let out a long sigh. The sigh let a lot of things escape.</p>
<p>“I'll give you the same shape of me” he said, “And you can take it and carry it with you all the time to stop me from pleasuring other women” But as he said this, he used a move he had learnt long ago form the masters, one to calm any woman down and make her subservient. He had never expected her to come with a knife, at least not so soon. It usually took a few months before their moods became that resolved, And so he knew he was dealing with something serious ehre.</p>
<p>“You misogynist” she said, in between moans, “You hate women, and are afraid of us, so you can only pleasure us to fool yourself that we are listening to you, actualluy your'e terrified of us because you can't connect to us and understand us at all”</p>
<p>“I don't know what you've been reading” William staretd the combo, women were just like opening a safe with multiple valves. He tiwsted a knob to the right five times, then rolled the other one to the left anticlockwise, then move the whole thing up and down. Then he used his tongue here and his leg there, moving her other leg around, like he was a fighting master praciticing his moves to perfection. He mvoed to the next place and tweaked that a bit, then ran his hands down and wen tot the next. It was all bookmark moves, and just when he expected it, in the end she moaned and twictehd all over, like a giant that was being slain. He built up speed, slicing faster, repeating the memorized moves more rigorously. Until she moaned one last time and heaved and it was all over. He kept going, he didn't know when to stop, she she asked him to, she held his hand still and removed it from her insides. He defeated her with a 50 punch combo. And he maintained her with high quality polishing.</p>
<p>And then something as sacred as pleasure became a game and an achievement to be unlocked.</p>
<p>It was all disgusting and nonsense really. It was all because there was something in the air that was affecting them, otherwise people would never do something like this. She knew how he was feeling, she looked at the knife laying on the ground in embarrassment. “Maybe you did it because of stress” she said, “I did it myself because I forgot what real pleasure felt like”</p>
<p>But William felt like the whoel way she tried to explain it, it was like it wasn't abig deal or anything at all. There was no money in this safe, so you can move on. He only got temporary peace and quiet that was stored in the safe, he went in the safe, and his beautiful friend closed it while he was inside. And the safe stopped anything outside from coming in, as well as stopping anything inside from coming out. It was a sanctuary for the inside from the outside and the outside from the inside. He lay there surrounded by metal, and in the inhumane cold metal he fiercely and methodically began to imagine things. Beautiful thigns with no distractions and that had nothing to do with either the outside or the inside world. But he felt that if anyone else had bene locked in this safe, they would imagien the exact same things that he had. And through it he felt a huge connection to other peoples'.</p>
<p>And between them there was so little happening, no words or talking. But in the silence they both felt extremely strongly about so many thigns that had just happened. On the outside it was normal, but in the inside, there was so much happening. It was like an apple slowly turning rotten, but with no change on the outside. It was only when you tested it with a bite that you knew what you had gotten yoruself into.</p>
<p>He was woken to the sound of his friend banging from outside and asking if he was okay.
He struggles and got out, then looked up at his friend, his eyes adjusted to the artifitical light form the lightbulb. He rememebred his friend, and looked at him, but it was different to what he rememebred, his friend was no longer beautiful, </p>
<p>There was a woman beside him, she had her hands on her hips and was demanding to know why he was sitting in there, “Is this a joke?” She had a badge fo some sort showing that she was in charge and this was within the list of her responsibilities. To take care of empty souled men stranded in one of the safes. “You were only in there an horu” she said, “Thank Goodness, but what if someone had come along and opened the safe and gotten a heart attack from seeing you in there? It's a very real possibility with the elderly peopel around us, don't laugh”  </p>
<p>“You look familiar” he said.</p>
<p>“Are you hitting on me? Are you trolling? What are you doing in our safe, I am going to have to report this to management”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-one-i-mean-is-this-morally-right">forty one: “I mean, is this morally right?”</h3>
<p>Before one of the meetings, Mr. Lazy was telling everyone about his ex girlfriend, before marriage. It's so long ago. He was silently protesting at being married.</p>
<p>He was sitting on the stool among the other dirty men, and telling them about this woman who had crossed his life. From a first listen it wasn't clear why he was telling this story, or who he was telling it to.</p>
<p>“She says such disgusting things, perverted, and horrible things about others. then goes back and listens to the calmest most relaxing and sweetest music. Jazz music with a good message of healing the world and doing good for others.”That's why I want to do good for others” she said. Everyone told me that she's such a great person and has good ideals and nice things and I'm lucky to be with her. And she smiled and agreed with them, but later back at home as soon as we got in the door she started complaining immediately and swore all these dirty words that you could never imagine coming out of her mouth. It was like she vomited and shat out of her mouth constantly, and you're only supposed to do those things once a day. She told me how I was useless and didn't support her in her career, or in front of others at parties, and she's embarrassed to introduce me to others. And I  became frustrated, so upset and angry. Why does she have to organize my life? And why does someone so beautiful like her have to be so dissatisfying to be around, ti doesn't make sense.”</p>
<p>The way Mr. Lazy was telling this story meant that the group had grown closer. If they had been separate strands of wool, now they were intertwining into a sweater or some shit, and unity was developing.</p>
<p>“One time she made me so angry, she went behind my back and resgiend me from my favourite club I joiend, and I'm going up to her, the kids are with her and she keeps them around her like bodyguards from me. She knows I'm coming, she's expceting me, and when she sees me she's going to try and change me or something. She has been trying these past two weeks to change me and she has set up a schedule for herslef, and every word she speaks is calculated to try and change me. Every motion during our sex is premeditated, and everywhere she goes is designed. It feesl like I'm dating a fucking robot, not a woman. And I'm going to tell her I want to cut her and leave her, but I can't because of the kids, and she knows that. So when I went up to her, it got messy, this part gets really messy. I tried to talk to her to tell her I was leaving, but she had the kids around her, and they looked at me, their stepfather, with a look of fear, like I was the bad one here. She had been whispering in their ears all sorts of things about me, in their bedtime stories I was the bad guy, and anything I did or said here, they would use it against me. They looked at me with eyes that said, why are you here to hurt Mum? I coudln't stand it, any of it, and I coudln't touch her, so I destroyed the vase in anger. After I left, she commanded the children like nothing happened, and she was the good one for not falling low to my level. She was a manipulative bitch, but sadly only I could see it because she was so fake with eveyrone else. She had her friends all fooled, and she had our kids fooled, she even fooled her own parents. She acted in a way that made them treat her well, or feel sorry for her. And then vicmitized herself by them to others. I knew that after I left she would tell everyone about me, how I treated her so bad and took advantage of her after she gave me everything. I know, I just know, because it's a story I heard so many times from her about others.” Mr. Lazy saw that Mr. Angry hadn't arrived yet, and went on.</p>
<p>“The funny thing is, and this always catches me, even though you know everyone's different and has their own values, but to herself she's a really hard working mother, and her husband, me, doesn't do what's right and what he should be doing to raise a family. I know that's what she's thinking. That the weird and unaccaeptable thing to me, that in my mind I'm right, but in her mind she's right you know? And how can you know which of us is actually right?</p>
<p>“And again, she did it, we were sitting in the local cafe near our house, just sipping coffee and acting social. Then suddenly, as if out of nowhere, she said such disgusting things, in a calm cafe, and elderly people all around, then it was really inappropriate. The others must have thought she was like this all the time, and they looked at me, judging who I must be for being with her. But it wasn't like that, she was only like this sometimes, and it surprised me as much, or even more than it surprised them to see her behaving this way. It was like her only release was to talk, and she did. When she said inappropriate things in a different language, no one knew what she was saying and they didn't mind it. One time there were three or four other guys with us, and she spoke to them like this. Everyone else around us was just doing their own thing, reading a book, or sipping whatever shit they preferred. I couldn't tell these strangers that this woman I'm with is just like that, sometimes, probably today, right now while I'm sitting here telling you guys this aspect about her, a distant woman I've known and grown close to. She might be saying disgusting things to someone. And she might even be talking to them about me. It was completely uncalled for, and it came out of nowhere, I had no idea she was even talking about me, it could have been someone else.”</p>
<p>With the outburst over, the members looked at each other. It was sudden, Mr. Purple never expected Mr. Lazy to be like this. He was usually quiet and orderly.  He was supposed to be a quiet reserved married man who respected those around him and lived in a reliable and responsible manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox sighed, after leaving space enough for an adequate silence to indicate she had processed what had been said, but not long enough to lose the moment “Now that Mr. Angry's not here, I wanted to ask people about this heist.”</p>
<p>So the meta-heist had begun. Mr. Melancholy swallowed, it seemed like Mr. Angry was stored synonymously in everyone's minds with heist. When he wasn't here, unresolved conflicts arose to the forefront of each member's conscience.</p>
<p>“What do you think of this heist?” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“It's great, we're really going to achieve this. We're going to change things.”</p>
<p>“No” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I mean, what do you think, now what Mr. Angry has told you.”</p>
<p>“So we're talking about feelings?” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox shrugged him off arrogantly, and he wanted to dominate her again. “No, we're talking about values. I feel like this heist is not just risky, it's not only life threatening, but it's also incredibly vain don't you think?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy said, “So you don't want to do the heist? Because all of a sudden you've got morals and it's not morally right?” He sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. The clock was still five minutes before the meeting, Mr. Angry was going to walk in on the dot. “Okay, so what do you think is okay? Why did you join this team if you don't believe in it? I'm scared to be working with you, if you're flaky you should have left before we came this deep. A moral conscience is the most fundamental thing. Shit, I can't believe we're working with someone like you.”</p>
<p>“Let's go back to basics” Mr. Purple said, “I don't care what kind of jobs you've worked before, or what you haven't done. But right now, in your opinion, what job is good?”</p>
<p>“It should help develop society” Mr. Chatterbox thought of all the people around her, her parents and friends that she wished to help, and she wished they would be proud of her. “Like some kind of philanthropic humanitarian work that directly helps others in need”</p>
<p>“Okay” Mr. Purple nodded, “That makes sense” Her eyes made a turn to look at Mr. Chatterbox, they were shimmering and dark, like she was bringing out something that shouldn't be seen. “That's great, so you do this philanthropic work, like the big charities, everyday you serve, you humble yourself level with the ground, and you pray and are sincere and do what helps the most people. It's good, it garners respect from all people.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox smiled, </p>
<p>“But what if you are so philanthropic, so generous with your resources, so caring and giving that others take advantage of you, they pillage your resources and murder your family because you have no defences set up.”</p>
<p>Where did that come from? Why would she even say that? “What?”</p>
<p>“Whoah” the atmosphere in the room changed. </p>
<p>“What?” Mr. Purple looked around, her arms still crossed, her heels still shiny, and her leg crossed over the other. “The more generous you are, the more likely you are to be taken advantage of right?”</p>
<p>“What if we're stealing things for everyone's good, what if we're stealing, not even stealing, the word stealing sounds connotative, we're just moving something to another place. Like we move house, or plates around, or artists move ideas, or comedians move jokes. Or I leave some air that I breathe out there, and someone else comes and breathes it here.” Mr. Chatterbox said. “It's just like sharing things” after a while.</p>
<p>“It doesn't benefit anyone though, it's a waste of time, like pouring pure pompous wine down a drain just to clean the drain,” Mr. Purple said. “Philanthropic work is all front end surface, at the back of it it's being supported by foreigners for foreigners, and by pumping short term solutions in you don't necessarily change the underlying problems you are trying to solve.</p>
<p>“It has to do good for others” Mr. Chatterbox said. She kept repeating this sentence like repeating it would give it strength.“Okay, so what if I work as a casino worker, or as a thief, to give it to the good, like Robin Hood did?”</p>
<p>“Then it's against the law though, and his system of justice might not be right and in accordance with the government.” Mr. Danger said, “You're still stealing, you're just doing it legally. The job is still dirty, it's a rogue effort.”</p>
<p>“Okay” Mr. Chatterbox thought of something legal, and worthwhile. “What about software development, making new things? Or a teacher who imparts knowlegde to the world?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple smiled, but the gaze of her harsh eyes never changed, she was still sharp and inciting a part of herself from the depths. “Okay, sure, these are noble professions that do good for people. Educating the next generation is indispensable, especially educating our children morally to become good citizens. And developing technology or developing anything is a fundamental expression of our human need for progress, and an expression of our own existence through creativity. True, there is no profession more sincere.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox smiled, </p>
<p>“But what if you're teaching rude children, children who yell and argue against everything you ask them to do. What if they swear at you and scream profanities. Then how are you going to try and teach these children knowlegde? The mysteries of the universe? Before you impart divine knowledge on them you have to teach them how to raise their hand and wait to speak. And what if you're constantly overworked and get home filling out forms and making lesson plans just to prove that youre doing a good job, you know you're doing a good job, but the paperwork is heavy. And when you work in a creative profession, you study and hone your skills to be able to make something and be judged by the world. But once you enter the industry you see yourself doing the same things everyday, pressing the same buttons, and moving the same signs around. The decisions are made by leaders, all you have to do is follow their choices. You have no say in the matter, and you're working in such a big team that your own creative expression is miniscule, it doesn't matter to the company whether you turn up to work or not, someone else is there behind you to replace you once you decide to leave.” Mr. Purple didn't move an inch, she staye dead still, whether it was because she was insecure or highly secure was unclear.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox's smile died.</p>
<p>“So then how about an even simpler job, a toilet cleaner, a road sweeper, a retail agent, a waitress, the simple job that don't need such high skills and levels of qualifications.”</p>
<p>“These are noble as well” Mr. Melancholy leaned in to hear what Mr. Purple would say about his own profession right now. “Unlike other jobs, they are welcome to most people, and everyone can contribute, as well as live their own lives, they aren't deanding jobs, but necessary. Cleaning the toilets, cleanliness is a fundamental attribute of our lives, and so follow cleaning the roads. Selling goods in a store requires sales skills, and painting motels is simple painting. It is easy. But on the other hand, you're a human, you're able to do so manyt things, and you have so many feelings and expressions, you have friends and family, and you have hardships in your life; what do these jobs have to do with that? You live one life and the rest of the time you live a job. Also, what happens when your services aren't appreciated, and you personally aren't improving, you're not developing skills, everyday you go to work you come back with money, but you are growing older, and before you know it you're like the colleague who has aged so much but still working the job with the same aspirations and weaknesses and strengths as a person who is just starting out on the job. What happens when you join this company process and have to follow every rule, and there's a memorized response for every action that happens. What do you do in that case? What do you do when you have to be doing things you don't like, have no interest in, day in and day out until you have no more energy left? There are people I know who have done this, and guess where they are now?” Mr. Purple pointed up, and smiled “Vwa la”</p>
<p>“Then how about a job with more purpose” Mr. Chatterbox said, “Like artists who express themselves purely and wholly. Separating themselves from the world to preach what they believe in.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple nodded, “That's a good one, everyone values individual expression, people are touched by the heroes we make. But it's also dangerous, because if pushed too far it becomes superficial, because there is nothing as unestablished and unclear as personal beliefs. Everyone interprets it differently, and when it is so shallow, it easily becomes superficial. And is it truly moral to preach what you know to the world, or to complain about things, or praise about things? The world is a lot bigger than you or me. After a while in this profession you realize you've walked off the edge of the world, and you're in empty space with nothing around you.”</p>
<p>Mr Chatterbox said, “Because I don't think stealing is good, what if you do a job that you're passionate about, as long as you have the passion, resutls will come.”</p>
<p>“Okay” Mr. Purple put a hand to her chin, she smoothly stroked it, she was careful in her ways. “There are friends I know who are professional poker players, every night they go to the casino for a few hours to gamble, for them it's not playing, it's serious work, and they work at it like an art or a craft, honing their skills. It's very complicated, and there are ruels for everything, which cards to fold on, which cards are the rocket doubles, and the probabilities ofr anything. In terms of complexity it may be more difficult than any other job. And there is more at stake than any other job. One display fo the cards makes or breaks your fortunes. Would you say that is good work? He is very passionate about what he does. He only works like this a few hours a day, but he makes enough to make a living, and he goes home and supports his wife and children, and he even donates any surplus money to philanthropic funds. Would you say this is a good job? He is passionate, and he is also doing good for others.”</p>
<p>“But he's gambling” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I don't like the fact that he gambles”</p>
<p>“Okay, so what if we change it?” Mr. Purple said, “He moves bank money, huge sums which change the world economy. He does this every single day for a short time, then lives the rest of his life in service to others. And he is also extremely talented at this job, so it's only right that he does this. Would that be okay?”</p>
<p>“But there's no effort from him” Mr. Chatterbox said, “He has to put an effort in as well”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple frowned, “Okay, true, effort is an important part of recognition and fulfilment, you can work at something you love with no effort and never gain any level of satisfaction. So what if we say he isn't talented at the job, but he finds himself in it, and he works very hard to earn the money, he takes a bit longer, but he still does it”</p>
<p>“But then why is he doing the job if he isn't talented at it? Shouldn't we all be expressing the things we're good at? What's the point in putting in effort for things we are no good at?”</p>
<p>“Okay” Mr. Purple was accepting, “So how about he's very talented, but still works extremely hard at moving bank money properly and for a just cause, checking the details of where he moves the bank money to before doing so, and making sure the outcome will be something of benefit to the world. He enjoys his job, and he can finish working early as well, to spend the rest of his day doing other things. He is expressing himself in this way. He's proud to tell other people that this is his job and this is what he's doing.”</p>
<p>“That sounds pretty good” Mr. Chatterbox said. </p>
<p>“Okay, but how do you make sure that it's of benefit, just because he's doing ti with the right reasons doesn't mean others will appreciate it. And what if others tell him he's wasitng his time because he's so talented, but not working hard at it.</p>
<p>“So he can work harder if he wants to”</p>
<p>“But if everyone just works when they want to, will anyone work? And what does he do for the rest of the time? Is it still productive to just work when you want to?And is it alright to just do what you want to do all the time?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he can work long hours when his boss asks him to, and when the boss doesn't say anythign he can go home, then both parties are satisfied right?”</p>
<p>“It's ridiculous how many parameters you're makingjust to do the right thing” Mr. Chatterbox said. “It's actually a lot easier than that. It should be.”</p>
<p>“If you accpet everyone, then that;s the way it will be. The more we put limits on it and narrow it down, the more it become sworthwhile supposedly, but also the less relevant it becomes to our lives, it's so specialized that it's just left alone as a clump of loneliness. If it has to be so small to be at its most important, then it's no longer a practical thing to uphold.”</p>
<p>“Why is it not good? Everyone steals, everyone lies, everyone cheats, sometimes you don't know it yoruself, sometimes you do, sometimes it's so small that it's normal, and sometimes it's really large and unacceptable. Morals are social constructs, they're not absolute things right?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I realy don't know anymore. It's like I'm walking through a library for a certain book, btu I don't know what the name fo the book is yet, so I can't look for it directly, so I have to read every book to know what it is. There's no signposts or directions, it's just constant reading, skimming through every word for the sentence that will tickle my heart.”</p>
<p>“That's a good attitude, once you get there, to complete confusion, then you can reassemble the jigsaw puzzle, but this time in a way that makes sense to you”</p>
<p>And then Mr. Melancholy realized that he had not once, during the time Mr. Purple was speaking, torn his gaze from her. He had been watching her, every action, every movement, watchign her lips move, her eyes see things, and her arms crossed. Looking at her body, her high heels, her clothing. And then her intelligence. </p>
<p>And then he fell in love with her. He coudln't see it himself, but it didn't look like anything special so that if anyone else came along, they would recognize him and say “Oh, he's falling in ;love right now” It wasn't like that, he looked ordinary, and plain, just gazing at her in a usual way. But in an undefined and uncategorized world, this was called love.</p>
<p>“What's moral is like that too, I think” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-two-pre-meeting-post-meeting-chats">forty two: Pre Meeting, Post Meeting Chats.</h3>
<p>What started out as a group of strangers became colleagues, and then teammates, and then human beings who depended on each other. It was over a short period, but when they were given a reason, people bonded. Sometime a short action had a long lasting result that gave comfort for a much longer time than it had taken to intialize.</p>
<p>The group had grown a lot closer as they bonded over small things. Everyone wanted something different out of it, but none of them was really accomplishing much.</p>
<p>One week William talked about women like they were the holy grail he had found next to the side of the motorway. The next week, he made sure only the guys were listening and told them the opposite. </p>
<p>“I'm so proud of my girlfriends” Mr.Melancholy said to Mr. Lazy and Mr. Danger. “Last week may not have been so, but right now I'm feeling comfortable. I met this new foreign girl, she's from some blasted country in war, and she's travelling right now, but she's so sexy, she walks and runs a lot.”</p>
<p>“Foreigners can't be trusted” Mr. Lazy said, “This isn't xenophobia speaking, this is my experience, I mean it sounds bad to say so, and it's not politically correct, but in general it's why they're shunned. They cheat a lot, and they don't shower as much. Besides, you can't trust whatever it is they tell you, it's just the latest lie they spouted.”</p>
<p>“I was with her” Mr. Melancholy said, “But she was like an alien, so strange, during the day she talked with her boyfriend she was travelling with, and they hold hands and walk together at the same pace, he carries her bag for her, and she tidies his hair when it gets ruined in the wind. It's a true relationship. She's so cold to me, ignoring me and not even talking to me. But then at night I hear loud knocks on my door, she's standing in front of me in a nightgown with probably not much underneath. And we do it, she's so desperate and tells me she's been thinking about me all day.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Mr.Lazy said. This wasn't good for a married man like him to hear, that sex was so accessible. “She's completely ruled by pleasure”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but then during the day she reverts back to this polite and ambitious traveller who's being blown about by the wind. She's with her boyfriend now.”</p>
<p>“And then at night she's crazy about you?”</p>
<p>“I'm telling you, we;ve done everything. But during the day she walsk with her boyfriend so close and romantically. I don't know if female players exist, but she would be one if they did.”</p>
<p>“She's not girlfriend material, she gave you sex right? You got it good, but that's it, there's nothing more, she can't commit, it's expected that she will cheat, so you have to play around that. I just feel sorry for her boyfriend who deals with her, I wonder if he knows her personality at night. But you knew that the moment she cheated with you, you knew that and went into it, so you're not exactly in a position to complain. When you buy a cheap product that you know is going to break, you can't complain when it actually breaks after you use it a couple of times, because it was cheap and easy to  obtain, and you always knew it was going to break. Sure it's in yoru right to complain and demand a refund, but who's going to listen to you? She won't, because she'll already be fucking some other guy”</p>
<p>“Dude” William said, “I never said that, I never complained, I'm just telling you guys to get your opinion on what you think”</p>
<p>“Well you got it, there”  It was Mr. Lazy who was saying all of this, and he went on. He seemed to be in a really bad mood today, had something happened? Or was this just a salty topic for him.</p>
<p>“Well you don't know anything about her” William said, “She's from Liiine, that's where she's from. DO you know where that is in the world? Or do you just diss every foreigner and every woman who isn't your wife? It's not just another prostitute shack where you probably found that woman you're fucking every night.”</p>
<p>“That's my fucking wife you're talking about calm it or I'm going to punch you” Mr. Lazy stood up with his fists raised and aimed at William, he stood there for a while, not willing to outburst. William had insulted his wife, but he didn't even dare stand up for her? What was wrong with him?</p>
<p>“It's a special place” William said. “It's not just another place, where are you from?”</p>
<p>“From my mother” Mr. Lazy said, slowly dropping his fists. </p>
<p>That was a quirky answer, and Mr. Purple, beside them, suddenly became interested in this man because of it. </p>
<p>“I talked to one of my guests” Mr. Purple said, “He was about eighteen or something, straight out of high school with a dry dick, and he asked me what the world was about?”</p>
<p>“Really?” Mr. Melancholy siad.</p>
<p>“No, not really, he asked me why I was painting the motels, and I took that to ask me what the purpose of the world was, so I told him for a man it was girls sex and stealing, and for a woman it was something else” </p>
<p>“That's the description you offered to an eighteen year old kid? You're corrupting young minds” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“He also asked me why I'm so old”</p>
<p>“No he didn't” Mr. Lazy said, “Who would ask that to a woman?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple answered immediately, as if she had been expecting this question,“He asked what it's like to be my age, I took that as a formal declaration telling me I was old, and so I told him this answer. Girls, sex, and stealing, that's what the world's about, don't you think? This kid was a guest at the hotel and still believes in the best of the world. He has dreams that will come true if you put enough effort in, and he has morals that make sense, and he has a girl out there somewhere who will give him true love and make his heart whole. He's pure, but what he doesn't realize, and what we've all learned, that when you hit about twenty and stand by yoruself for the first time, your pureness will disappear, not one day, but over time, and when you look back you've become one of those people you hate. You used to looka t others and despise them for ruining the world, but then now you see that person as yourself, it's ahorrible feeling. You have been replaced by a ruthlessness. That's what usually happens, either that or you die.”</p>
<p>“Wow, your optimism is off the charts” Mr. Danger said, “No wonder you don't talk much”</p>
<p>“No, I think she ahs a point” said William, partly because he agreed, and partly because he wanted to grow closer to Mr. Purple by saying something to agree with her. “We're all on a straight and good path going to the right place sailing smoothly, but love, sex, death, drugs, and jobs get in the way of it all, no matter how you are, you can't escape from these ambitions or vices or whatever you want to call them.”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple though, hardly looked at William, she never showed any interest in him or what he had to say. And William wondered why she showed interest in the others, was it because they were just more interesting? Were they more attractive? Or was he just incapable of standing at the same level as them?</p>
<p>“What made you think this way?” Mr. Chatterbox asked Mr. Purple. “Why are you so negative about everything”</p>
<p>“I'm not negative, I'm being realistic, the world runs in a certain way, and the faster you find that way the easier a time you're going to have.”</p>
<p>“So you have an easy time?”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple probably wasn't a good girlfriend, she wasn't material either, “I had a boyfriend once, he was a really nice guy, anticipating my needs and even giving more. But I took advantage of him, I knew it at the time but didn't admit it, now I admit it. While he was at home one evening and I just finished work I got home and texted another guy to come over and help me with something. I was feeling horny and wanted some company, my boyfriend didn't excite me anymore in the same way, so he came over, and we got friendly and staretd havign a good time.”</p>
<p>“What's a good time?” Mr. Lazy asked.</p>
<p>“What's wrong with you, sex?” She said it like it was a matter of fact.</p>
<p>“Ohh”</p>
<p>“Anyway, the guy texted his best friend, at the time I didn't know, but his best friend was also my boyfriend, they were close all the time. Then for some reason, my boyfriend called me, I mean it was fine to talk, but this guy's hand was fingering me like a violin, I didn't really stand a chance. I tried to answer cheerfully. And my boyfriend sounded as usual, but then and there I felt so bad, and I felt sorry for him, I wanted to tell him what I was doing but of course I couldn't, and this guy was ruthless, he touched me everywhere so forcefully. He pulled my hair and pinched my nipples. I'd never felt anything like it. I didn't know at the time, but sex with him probably awakened me as a woman, and taught me about the world. The moment I orgasmed I changed, befroe and after it, I felt like a different person.”</p>
<p>This story was completely shocking, none of them expected something so confessional from sucha  quiet person, and it was so sophisticated and private as well. Why was she telling them this? What did they do to qualify to her secret?</p>
<p>“I don't want to lost the relationship with my boyfriend, but I also wanted to be close with this guy who was fucking me, his best friend. So I tried to answer cheerfully, “Hey how's it going”</p>
<p>“Hey I'm glad to hear your voice, what are you up to?” he says, and I have to lie, I can't tell him my boyfriend has his dick poing in and out of me and I'm barely able to answer properly. I can't tell him that I have never been this turned on doing something so prohibited.</p>
<p>“Hey, I'm just going...ah..to go shopping...ah, not much, it's been a lazy day.” And then I had to put a hand over the guy's mouth, this call was very important to me, and had to be very careful. I moaned in between my talking. I told him it was just hiccups.</p>
<p>“I love you” he said. “I hope I can see you soon” He said that every time we talked, and there were certain responses I usually gave, and this time it made me want to cry tears, as well as scream out in pleasure, he was moving faster inside me. I ran over the frequent dialogue in my head and this is the best I could come up with.</p>
<p>“Yes, me too” I said, the guys hand was on my breast and circling it. It was so unexpected and the pleasure was monstrous. I screamed out here, like “Aghhh” and he said </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I just saw some really nice clothes, they're so cute!” I moved the guy's hand off me and puleld his dick out of me like it was a pencil in a pencil sharpener and sat up. “When will we get to meet each other next time” I said. “I miss you so much” While I said this, I remember this scene where the guy was there, he didn't look like a guy, only an animal, I could only see his hands touchign me and a bit of his dick next to my thigh like a leaky pipe, none of his face and his emotions showed. He had a dog chain on. I reached out and played with it as I listened to what my boyfriend was telling me on the phone. He talked and talked and I grew hornier and hornier, and so desperate to finish the conversation and have more sex.”</p>
<p>“Why are you telling this? Is it even true or are you making it up to pleasure us guys?”</p>
<p>“No” she said, “I just want to let you know that I'm a bad woman now, I used to be a good one, but now I'm bad. No person who did something to betray someone so heavily could possibly still call themselves a good person. But at the same time, maybe in somewhere as close as the next room, there is usually a woman of opposite stature who is the perfect girl for any man, she always tells the truth, never lies, is always considerate of those around her, she convinces everyone to do good and leads by example, she's hard working and never cheats or finds shortcuts, she waits until marriage and abstains, she's trustworthy and you can give her any job to finish. She's just a pure joy to be around and is the type of woman every dirty man dreams of being with. But actually the boundary between these two types of people, is paper thin, it's no dichotomy. I think so” Mr. Purple said, “That's what I wanted to say. No matter who, they can get with a loser man who whispers beautiful tales and sings amazing songs, and whose fingers can play anything and turn it into an instrument.”</p>
<p>“All right, you lot, let's get in a semicircle” Mr. Angry had entered. The clock was right on the dot. He didn't mind what everyone was talking about, he had his own papers and statistcis to go through. “We need to go over the tiral run of the heist, the results, and how we all performed unsupervised. There were a lot of promising results, but just as many worrying disappointments that we need to mitigate.”</p>
<p>“Firstly” he pointed at the three men, “You went into the wrong room and stole the wrong woman? That is absolutely bad”</p>
<p>He pointed to Mr. Purple, “You unlocked all of the gates and made sure the security cameras were pointed elsewhere, that was absolutely good”</p>
<p>After work William followed Mr. Purple, he didn't know anythign aobtu her, just that she had her own way of seeing the world, and he admired it, he wanted to talk to her more and get her opinion on things.</p>
<p>He followed her down the strete, at first it felt normal, but after a while following her into the forest he felt like a stalker. She was walking in the middle of nowhere, but his curiosity overflowed inside him. He follwod her up a small path up the mountain, then behind one of the trees he felt her breath, she was standing beside it with her arms crossed and looking at him with a gaze that said Well, explain youself. It was also really attractive to see her so in control of a situation.</p>
<p>“Can we talk?” William said, “I want to ask you something”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple's hair was bllowing in the wind, even under tree cover, and she was fit, she probably walked here everyday. She looked around, not for other people, but at the weather, her fingers scratched each other, and she looked up and gave a long sigh. Almost like a cow or big mammal giving an ingrained cry as a warning for predators.</p>
<p>“A storm is coming” she said. Her voice mixed with the wind and it was hard to hear her clearly. But he was pretty sure that was what she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple has actually said, “I don't love you” But she saw Mr. Melancholy's reaction and was relieved he hadn't heard it.</p>
<p>They found cover under a tree, it was still windy, so she put her feet together, he sat in front fo her blocking the wind. “What do you want to talk about?” She said, with one arm holding her hair in place, she had no idea why he had followed her, or why he wanted to speak here. But he was probably lonely, lonely people did many actions that were hard to explain.</p>
<p>William was finally with her, this woman was more amazing up close. He couldn't tell why, he was captivated by her, the look she gave, her wisdom, her pessimism, her insensitivity to the world. </p>
<p>“I get bored easily” he said, “I don't want to complain, but I wanted to tell you some things. I want to get my job done and get out of here, then find the next challenge before I get too bored and depressed, and then anxious” William was telling her this, probably because he thought she would have an answer he could accept. One of the hardest things was to walk around everyday with so many questions and being unable to accept most of the answers.</p>
<p>The world was still howling in her face, but in a gesture of politeness she shrugged it off, she let her hair hang like a rainstorm, and she covered her eyes to listen to him, there was no change in her expression. “I feel like a loser, doing all of these things, saying all of these things in the meetings, like I'm everyone's equal or something. But actually I am nothing to do with others. I'm trying to make them laugh, that's my medicine, then each time someone laughs, I feel a bit better about myself. It makes me feel relevant, and the world is less amazing and less special, and less hazardous as well. But others laugh, and then go and live their life. They don't linger with the laughter, they move on.”</p>
<p>Gossip spread, it came with the cloud of rain above, and the strong pressure change invited a voluptuous wind that screamed up the dark green side walls of the building below them. Mr. Purple raised her head to listen to William, but the rain was becoming intolerable. He was screaming into the wind but she could hardly hear him. This lonely man wanted her to understand something, and she nodded to appease him, but she couldn't make out a word. </p>
<p>When the dark clouds were above them it suddenly grew dark as well, the rain was still beating at the same tempo, but now they coudlnt' see each other. It was still the afternoon, but today it was pitch black. They were listening to each other, but they didn't know where they were, if there was a cliff in front of them, or whether the bench they were sitting on was moving. But the gossip came with the treaturous weather. He was confessing everything, That William already slept with Charlotte before Annalise, and after her many others as well. The girls all knew that he slept around, the guys joked about it all the time, but Annalise was the last to find out, because everyone said she was so serious about him, they were afraid to be the one to break the news to her. Charlotte was offended, because she was so serious about William, even more than others, but no one seemed to acknowledge her feelings. His response was that he was serious each time, and he loved every one of these girls. But Annalise wanted more of an explanation, it was his explanation, but not the type of explanation that she was looking for. She wanted to hear the he would be loving her and only her, no-one else.</p>
<p>When he stopped, the ground was wet, their shoes were wet, and her hair was straddled around her neck like a belt. People felt pressured and anxious because the rain and weather around them, it made them distrust people in general. The weather created their mood.</p>
<p>William leaned in, he wanted to protect Mr. Purple from whatever was out there, just for one person in the world, he wanted to be able to make a difference. “Charlotte always wants to be more popular and more involved and know everyone. She's fighting the popularity ladder, but then she realised, I think about sometime last week, that she was the only one climbing this ladder, everyone else had left it already, from HS, and now there was a big heist going to happen, there's word going around about it. Later she discussed it with me, she told me she was worried, and the two of us should get out of here. But I was lying next to her in bed with my arm wrapped around her, she has moved so she is closer to me, then I grabbed her breast and started playing with it. Breasts by now I have become so familiar with, too familiar with, so t's like climboing the same mountain behind my house every afternoon. Then while I'm doing this over her, she's enjoying herself, but her window is open and the cool breeze blows in. Like the world is smoking in your face, and I notice snow, it's just cold cold water which is on the windowsill and all over the desk. But I open the curtain and look out and see the mountains covered in snow, and the trees around us as well. An hour ago it was green outside, and touching Charlotte like that with the weather suddenly changing, for some reason it made me want to cry. But Charloote just keeps talking to me, “Not now, I'm talking about something seriosu that might happen” It's an oxymoron, serious and might. I told her it was fine, she shoudln't believe these things are going to happen. And then, like usual, I moved my hand down.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple hadn't moved the whole time, her face was covered in her hands, and her hair was blowing all over like the petals of a flower. But she moved, and it was dark so it took a while to notice that she was looking at him. “We're all so old” she said, against the wind, “So we need someone older naturally. On one of my jobs, a big heist as well, our leader desperately needed the assistance of someone inside, he had miscalculated something, but was afraid to tell us because he correctly assumed we would be upset.” So instead of telling us, he got angry at us for small things and blamed us for his failures. But he decided to trust a feeble weak looking old man for information. This old man was a guard, who had the keys and access that we needed, and he was harmless, he smiled to everyone and was friendly, his excitement every weekend was to shave his beard and read Pride&amp;Prejudice and Wuthering Heights or something like that. He never spoke to anyone, he didn't even nod or reply, even to the bosses. He just ate and left. Then my boss saw him and was overjoyed and couldn't stop smiling. But everyone else didn't know what was happening.
It turned out even the harmless old man is plotting so much and going to go against them. And in the end the leader was killed, because they knew exactly where he was and what he was stealing from them.”</p>
<p>The wind grew like a hunger, but it was comfortable for them both to be sitting here amongst it.</p>
<p>“Charlotte decided to trust me completely, everything will be fine. But now I'm afraid to betray her feelings” William said. “I'm going to be like one of her failure stories that she is going to complain to everyone about”</p>
<p>“At least you became a story, some people never become stories, they become a minute detail, a weakness, in someone's life.” </p>
<p>Mr. Purple was listening to every word, and William, in the spur of the moment leaned over to put his lips next to hers, she didn't move, he took a chance. And only realxed when he felt her gentle response. Her lips twisted back. They stayed like this before drawing back. He saw the raindrops running down her eyelashes, the water from his chin had dripped on her chin and neck, and she ahd a face the looked like she was crying, her eyes were squenched up, and her mouth was frowning, but in this heavy rain he didn't know. </p>
<p>“I met Charlotte for the first time last week” Mr. Purple said, “I knew you always spoke highly of her, and you recommended her to everyone. But when I met her, I saw nothing but disappointment and a really let down attitude. She had no energy, she had no passion, she looked like a worn out fishing net that had holes and grasses growing on it. And then I wondered, why does Mr. Melancholy, who I really respect, like this person? I disliked her so much just form that first impression alone, and I didn't want to know how much further my dislike of her would go. I wondered if Mr. Melancholy saw something in her that everyone else didn't, does he see something that I am unable to see? Or does she change her character in front of everyone?</p>
<p>“You thought about me?” William said, against the cold wind. </p>
<p>She nodded and said something. Then they started walking back together. Mr. Purple woudlnt' tell him where she lived or where she wanted to live. She just walked in front of him with her butt swinging like a pendulum. She was so fit.</p>
<p>William kept talking, the dusk had arrived and only the distant was light, all around them was dark, “I like the foreign girl, don't get me wrong, I like a lot of girls, I'm excited all the time, but there's this one girl who drives me absolutely nuts, I can't function properly around her. I can go on Facebook and everything, but when it comes ot this girl's picture, it's a whole new level of anxiety and nervousness that's so strong that it becomes crippling.” As he kept talking, he felt like he was feeling a whole new level of listening, that the women and men he had been with had never listened to him, he spent time with them but without the connection he was looking for, but right now he was becoming comfortable, because he felt like he could say what he needed to. “Just looking at her picture reminds me of everything and I become so weak and nervous just to press a button to contact her, never experienced anything like this. It's like there's a formula to unwind every strong man down into jelly, a useless slush, and this girl has that formula, if you know what I mean. But this foreign girl already left with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple gave her own answer from her own experience, they sat under one of the hundreds of trees that lay between their work and homes. “I made a contract with one of my boyfriends, he would give me anything I wanted, and in return I would give him confidence to be himself. And out of the two we both agreed that my end of the deal was greater, because confidence to be yourself was one of the rarest things in this world. Because if you have it, you will just be the loneliest person. But if you don't have it you would be the loneliest as well as the saddest person, and life was a balance between being lonely and solitude and minimizing your pain. We signed it together and put it away so it didn't get wet in the rain. It gave us both fond memories to think about this contract frequently.” Mr. Purple pulled up her wet wet sleeve, and underneath the cotton and water there was a black tattoo with written words, it was exactly as she said.</p>
<p>Now it was William's turn, Mr. Purple got up and walked off, he followed and talked behind her, he was surprised at how much was coming out of him “I always contradicts myself, I say the opposite things to everyone, living in the moment. Not just living in it, but ruled by it. I'm a slave to my passions. Everyone gives me different advice because they meet a different part of me. I live on other's advice because I'm vulnerable and need support. I have so many needs that make me change character all the time and unable to stick with one person.</p>
<p>“You're not suited to crime” Mr. Purple said, “I can see why Mr. Angry would hire you, and I can see why you would accept, because you want the challenge and the experience, but you're not actually suited for it. It's clear to me the more you tell me”</p>
<p>When she said that it made him feel like she was telling him he didnt' fit in with them. “Why? Is it because what I'm saying is too weak?”</p>
<p>“Well why are you doing this organized crime? I'm asking you as your business partner. It's not like you came here specifically to rob the hotel.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>“Because us” she said, “we came here to rob the hotel, that's the only reason, we were recruited away from here, you're the only one that Mr. Angry recruited here”</p>
<p>“What...” That slipped his mind, did that mean that he was less valuable than others? He thought he was in the same boat as them. “I thought you were all amateurs here, except for Mr. Danger who has a history of violent crime”</p>
<p>“The most violent one is Mr. Angry himself, but we're all special criminals. Mr. Angry has a bounty on his head, but like Mr. Chatterbox, she's also highly dangerous, but she sees you and probably wants to tame herself and throw away this lifestyle and become clean. That's probably what she finds so attractive about you” </p>
<p>It suddenly all made sense, so she liked him for something that he wasn't even proud of. It was a bit disappointing, it made him feel distant to the rest of the crew. This kind of news always came after he felt close to everyone. He felt like he had signed up into a totalitarian regime, not a team of heist, this was a classroom where he was headed away from knowledge and towards ignorance. How many lies must he be told before he realized it wasn;n't the truth. Either not the truth in the world, or not the truth he wanted to be told.</p>
<p>“The foreign girl I met” his mind went to her because she seemed pure and a lot calmer than everything that was happening here. “She loved her appearance so much, she would marry it if she could.”</p>
<p>And then William realized that the emotions he felt so strongly, the strong insecurity, and everything, it al didn't matter anymore. He was suddenly secure and not needing anyone to support or protect him. Because he was already far enough away from everyone. He suddenly didn't want to talk to Mr. Purple, she made him feel unwelcome here.</p>
<p>“This whole heist was organized by him, he has given everything for this, but in the end he's probably also the one who will become even more lonely and left in solitude.” Mr. Angry would become something close to the loneliest man in the world. He had stolen everything he could from those around him, until he walked by himself. He could walk off proudly if he tried.</p>
<p>In front of them a Bus stopped, it pulled past, behind it was smoke like neon light nebula covering a whole area. Then a lady with a tempered face walked past quickly, and then a whole bunch of people got fof the bus behind her. They all looked tired after a long ride home. Last was a nonsense-looking man. And he wondered if it was Mr. Angry's ex girlfriend. For some reason he wondered if it was her.</p>
<p>“Mr. Angry is always suspicious of police or cameras or things out to catch him. He double checks everything and sees everything as a threat, even a harmless question that someone asks, he will let it soak in his mind” </p>
<p>“So he can't even trust us?” William said</p>
<p>“No” she said, “He doesn't trust the people he's hired to work with him in this clandestine heist. He doesn't trust a soul. I thought he trusted me, but it turns out he never did. He's a lonely person always on the run, and never wanting company, yet always wanting company. It's the people who swing back and forth who are the most alive right?”</p>
<p>They were both inspired by their own words, it was one of those self generative conversations. Because it was so true...silence became profound, because it was so deep. Mr. Purple said, “My friend once told me that a long time ago there was the rhythm of loneliness that pulsed for the first time in the world like a church bell in a dark wet forest, and then it became so popular and widely remembered around the village that it kept pulsing, people kept it going, until it became the rhythm in everyone's lives.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense” William said, “Or else I'm just mentally ill, we're all mentally ill and have borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia, and the other big words, all very common disorders in certain places. That makes me socially unadaptable.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let's just say it was the first, that sounds a lot better than some bell.” </p>
<p>The truth was that the reasons for these things could number all around the globe, and no one would know any answers.</p>
<p>William finally told her what he wanted to say, he knew now what it was. “During the practice heist, I saw you”</p>
<p>“I saw you too”</p>
<p>“No...”he blushed, “You and the GM, is he going to do it to you?While we're in the next room taking the other gear and moving it around, and stealing things? It feels horrible and I don't want to do it”</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>“I don't want to see you being taken by some filthy man while weall know about it, how can that be a plan?”</p>
<p>“It was the reason I was brought in to his heist” Mr. Purple said. William stopped and looked at her, the way she said it sounded sad, and when he saw her face, he knew she was sad about it. It wasn't just her sound.</p>
<p>“That's all?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Angry analyzed the GM's tastes in women, and he was looking for a match when he found me, that's all it is, I'm not an enigmatic or highly accomplished woman, I'm not someone special and talented like all of you, I'm not even particularly pretty, I'm jhsut an average woman who happens to fit the lusty requirements of one of our clients. In this heist, I'm like a prostitue...”</p>
<p>He didn't dare say it, but he was thinking it was well. The polite thing to do would be to deny it, to make her feel better. But Mr. Purple had probably wanted to say this for a long time now. </p>
<p>“I don't know” he said, “But it feels horrible for me to experience this, no amount of money will get rid of this feeling, of knowing you are doing that next door. It's probably not something a human should experience. Poverty can be a blessing to some, but not this.”</p>
<p>“So would you rather not take the money?” Mr. Purple looked touched that he cared about her, he was thinking about her even while no one else had.</p>
<p>“I don't know”</p>

<pre><code>                || “It's a Heist story”
</code></pre>
<p>William stood in the store. His hands were in his pockets, which was a no go. He hadn't shaved in a while, which was a no go. And he wasn't smiling to his customers, they stood in a long line. Some o the Indians just wanted cheaper discounts on discounted items. The Chinese spent their money like it was mahjong tiles, they swiped their card, and then checked the price afterwards. Then aman came in eating an icecream, and Elizabeth ran over to tell him politely to consume the goods outside.</p>
<p>The heist was going to be amazing. He was going to step above all of this around him, all of the customers asking the same questions, and repeating the same answers day in and day out about the same tours on offer, and the same store materials they had. After his shift, William left his timesheet out for his boss to sign. He also had timesheets or other departments that he had worked at recently. From Housekeeping and the restaurant. Because it was one hotel it was all interchangeable.</p>
<p>Then Jeena came up to William when the queue had died down, but they still had staff around to take care of any sudden influxes of people. “I walked past the halls yesterday” she said. “And I was wondering, everyone talks about your room being full of stuff, papers and designs, ideas everywhere, can I ask you what it's about?”</p>
<p>William looked at her for a long time. Even though they had had sex, it wasn't anythign she had seen before. She didn't know that a man was capable of creating and harvesting such an expression.</p>
<p>“What do you do during your spare time?” she said. “Do you have any hobbies?”</p>
<p>“I'm a writer” he said. “That's why I don't speak much”</p>
<p>Jeena didn't answer, her eyes had widened like she had seen a ghost. A ghost who was alive. “Do you know I write too?”</p>
<p>Jeena talked to William for ten minutes and finally convinced him to show her his work. After work he took her to his room, but there were no clothes removed. The writing was serious for him, it was independent of any world. It was a means in itself. </p>
<p>William was talking about the story as if it were his lover, someone he was married to. And as he talked, he now knew why he was never satisfied. It was because his satisfaction lay here. “This story can potentially be very interesting, if I just focus on the thrill and adrenaline of it. Like Heat, which is so dangerous and you worry for them characters. There are scenes of anticipation that are made beautiful with lighting changes. And there are perspectives of so many characters. We explore the enemy, or the problems that are also possible and will risk everyone's lives. And I hope someone will tell and describe and chant my story this way, and glorify me, because I want to be remembered. That's really me” he said.</p>
<p>“Can I read it?” Jeena saw the manuscripts lying around, theywere everywhere, pasted on the walls, on the bed, under the bed, like bedcovers and wallpaper. The old ones were toilet paper. They were covered in small squiggly words in a tiny font. She pictured William scrambling around the room searching for whichever one was there. Each sheet was large, about the size of her torso, and ideas were linked together like a flow chart. It seemed like a really amazing story, something compeltely baffling. Why would someone who lived here be doing something like this?</p>
<p>She stopped looking at the manuscripts and looked up at William. “Read it” he said, “You're here now”</p>
<p>Jeena looked down and moved her hair out fo the way, she staretd on the ground, crouching down like a kid on all fours and reading these letter. They just flowed and flowed...</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-four-what-jeena-read-1">forty four: What Jeena Read 1</h3>
<p>Okay, so this is a really cheesy way of putting my ideas down, but the fact is that the ideas are good, and UNI is getting really busy, and I have vowed to finish this project for the past few months, I was supposed to finish it almost four months ago, but it kept expanding, so this is the ebst way of doing this. I conetmplated deleting sections, but in the end this is all a part fo it. Skip over what you want, it's your choice. </p>
<p>Thanks as always!! 
Me :)</p>
<p>The sound of money hitting the counter was cold hard evidence. It attracted the boss to come and check what was happening, and it also attracted a fashionable woman who was known as the local gold digger. During their lunch breaks they talked about her. She always followed behind the big boss who came into the store, looking who was throwing that money on the counter.</p>
<p>“These are stories about the customers I met” William said. “Just ranodm things, some of it I made up, some of it I observed.”</p>
<p>On first seeing William, Jeena never expected him to be so thoughtful like this. She had always been excited to meet another writer, but she didn't think he would be like this.</p>
<p>William had a title labelled Surreal Scenes</p>
<p>Surreal Scenes:
Sunglasses reflect green world concave. Interesting? His girlfriend has shades which reflect a yellow world, slightly less concave. Then we see MC's face reflected from different colours in it.
Get dressed and check hair, do things in front of the mirror, etc.</p>
<p>The people he's supposedly close with, they are horrible to him, but he takes it normally.
She's upset, she says she married a ghost. She checks herself, tries to puke out things after every second meal, every second day, to check that she's not a ghost, and the food will come out, it's still there. Her friend stands by calmly as she does it, she's used to it and it's normal.
The third person looks at it, astounded and shocked by the suddenness and unacceptability of it all.</p>
<p>Two young girls saying and doing things in the cafe. 
Two asian girls come into the store and are a bit lost, but always pretty.
People say he is weird, the older people say he is weird and not doing anything.
But actually, others are all saying that he is really good at it and moving forward.     </p>
<p>“It's kind of weird” William scratched his head, “You're not supposed to read that part” But there was no response from Jeena, she couldnt' stop reding it and re-reading it.</p>
<p>“It's amazing” She looked up at him after the long pause, “I can imagine you seeing this in the customers, and doing these things with them. It;s really excitgint to see you read this, I also write about our customers, but the things I see are completely different to yours.”</p>
<p>Then William knew it wasn't a mistake to show Jeena his work, she understood. Even if others didn't, she did.</p>
<p>Stories from the Customers:
R1
There are two criminals, one is called A, and one is called B, they are both unimportant to others, but important to themselves. They were both members of a big gang who are going to pull off an extraordinary heist if it works, and a ticket to jail if it doesn't. A is part of the crew, and so is B, but they pretend not to know each other during the day, they only find out at the actual gathering. A doesn't tell B anything about it, even after asking, because he only speaks to their boss, he's a bit of a lone wolf. Then B becomes a bit envious of the boss, and a bit upset at A, how come he doesn't get the same respect that A gives to B?
The boss also doesn't hire women, because he doesn't trust them. So B involves a different woman in it inadvertently during the day? </p>
<p>When he's alone, B privately listens to music, through the small string-music is flowing and into his brain. He is drowning in the music, there is no world around him now.</p>
<p>R2
Rubbish bins are convenience stores for the homeless. They each own one rubbish bin as their own territory, and the ones right outside the hotels are the best ones, or the tourist hotspots.
Go to the rubbish drop-off area and realize that there's no rubbish to be put away.</p>
<p>It's still bright outside, so think about going to Mieller hut, a beautiful day walk. Thinking about it all the time until night falls. Thens tars come out, and want to be with her suddenly. Feel security, and like life makes sense, and things are moving on properly, not sturggling anymore.
So listen to your heart and what it wants, you have to.</p>
<p>R5:
They keep bashing him, all of his decisions, all of his choices, and he can't really choose anything or do anything. Because the others keep assaulting him and saying he is no good. Or his decisions aren't sound, why doesn't he do this, why doesn't he do that, his choice is so expensive, not very good, etc. 
Then arrive at friend's place, havent' met for a looong time.
Then Mummy was supporting me in the car, but then go back home and suddenly not supporting anymore. But also, I am indecisive about it, I shouldn't have said anything then, I should just pick up and go, right?</p>
<p>“But there's one</p>
<p>Mum is in car, visiting friend's family, bought only chocolate for own children, so tells them to eat it up first, then they can go in, don't have enough for everyone.
She doesn't even realize that what they are doing is hogging for themselevs, it's just natural reaction. </p>
<p>For her and her two kids (When they visit this person in this village, compeltely different environment) They are so kind to him and treat him so well, nowhere else in the world are people so kind so quickly, and it rubs off on you wherever you are.</p>
<p>Then he starts to wonder if this is the way to live life, rather than any other way. And forgets about the hogging and the other lifestyle a moment ago.</p>
<p>R4:
A and everyone else band together and say B shouldn't be with Sarah(their names are A,B, and C, but I;m trying to be kind, but others say I'm leading her on. But it's not very good, just being kind, and wrong things happen. Being kind to someone is going against the social mould?</p>
<p>William gets so insecure that these others know so much more about him than he does, and he can't do anything to help them, etc. Then Daniel laughs, because he knows that feeling and it can't be shaken off, although others tell you to shake it off.</p>
<p>See people on the street and keep being reminded of what kind of people they are and what they all do, and what they all say. Reminded that she is like Sophie, and he is like Jenna, etc. Everyone reminds everyone of someone else. And hey all want to be there, and enevr where they are now.</p>
<p>Proper Damage Per Second
Dislike somone even more, and going to steal their money, and feel justified and more passion for it. But can't let it affect them. Get more excited.</p>
<p>Collateral Damage
Before they are going to steal something, a woman that they really like and who is kind, old and helpful to them, she gives them something to put in the safe. Their own belongings, something apssed down, so valuable to her, more valuable to her than to anyone else, but they have to take it, because it's part of the wholesale. She's buying it for her son, the one for her daughter she already gave away, she has been choosing jewellery throughout the story.</p>
<p>Don't want to take it, but they do, and they justify it by saying more good than bad has done. But then see William, and he is ruthless, he doesn't care about it. When they ask, he says “So?”</p>
<p>A Random customer talks about designing the building, connection between everything:</p>
<p>One customer came in, he was the architect and was designing the building, and talked about how the one floor was made to not be soundproof anymore. It was just a random detail, but in the right context it becomes very important. He wandered in at the specific time, right after this person, and two minutes before the next person, and pressed his fingerprint on it. </p>
<p>A lady came into the store today and gave out flyers, she did it really normally like she has done it a thousand times, and like it's expected for us to agree ot it and give money to her. Almost as if, if we disagree we are going against the moulds of society. But where is she from? She looks like this is her store and everyone else agrees with her? But actually everyone's just walking past. Does she think we are selfish? When she acts so kind, it makes us feel guilty for not helping such a sweet and sincere cause.</p>
<p>Dyring work it's crowded, and the only privacy for smoking is in the toilet, or in the shower. So he plans everything and writes everything in there.</p>
<p>The secrets only women know
At night, after 12am, talk about deep topics of hatred, but during the day joke around with colleagues and gradually start to make an exclusive group for thieving, they are a very unhealthy group, but during the day are the most normal as well. It is difficult to imagine up the change we see.</p>
<p>Women, some deep part of them, some unknown part of them was just unable to understand something and just inherently messed up. Some part of them is screwed up, like men, and they will lash out. This si what a man tells him. The stories men only tell each other.</p>
<p>She is all smiles, and she excuses herself, says a joke with everyone and leaves to go to the bathroom. Then they see on the videocamera, she si swearing and shouting, and wrigglign her hips, and just doing really weird things in the bathroom, slapping the mirror with her stockings. 
Then later she does herself up, washes her sweat off, perfumes herself and tidies up her hair, she comes back out and smiles. </p>
<p>The guys all smile back, it's so awkward.The other woman there tells her afetrwards while they are walking togetehr, that the men all saw it. She freezes up and goes red, “Oh my gosh, what?”</p>
<p>“You slapping and doing weird things, I know, all women do it, but you can't show guys that, they're horrible, if they know who you reallya re they're horrible, so you can only show women right?”</p>
<p>“I know, I know, every one of us knows okay?”</p>
<p>“What are these secrets?” he said.</p>
<p>She smiled, “I can't tell you, I can't betray our secret to you, then next time when you meet someone else you will know, and she might feel foolish”</p>
<p>“Please tell me” he leaned over closer on the bed, and things were starting to become interesting.</p>
<p>“I can't betray all of the women in the world” she said, “For you” She poked him on the chest, like a pencil on a piece of paper. “Besides, there are only a few men who know, and they're different, we can instantly tell, and women don't approach them, because they know that these men know, and it's no point. So it's better kept a secret” she smiled, “Don't you think?”</p>
<p>“How do women learn it then?”</p>
<p>“When we come of age” she said, “We gather around in a circle and tell each other the secret, around a bonfire with howling owls and marshmallows.”</p>
<p>“Really?” his eyes widened up.</p>
<p>She gave him a bored look, “Seriously? Does that even sound real to you? Of course not, I can't believe you actually believed that”</p>
<p>Customer Complaint &amp; Story:</p>
<p>Today a customer came in and told a story, or a complaint.</p>
<p>Their family was to go on holiday, but the son said he would rather be with gf, and was bored of being with family, although this is supposed to be family time. Father always gets angry at son anyway, so what's the point? The Son was torn between supporting parents, and supporting the life he wants to live. Does he know who he is? At work, while others are working, I went to the back to talk to him. The coutner was busy, but I was sorting goods, and could talk to him freely. He told me a story, and it's so random to be talking to a customer about his personal story, but he also probably likes to tell it quite a lot. </p>
<p>He is mesmerized by the song a woman sings and runs to her no matter at what cost. He is willing to throw away his family, his friends, those who have cared for him and worried about him and helped him for all his life, he will throw them away for an exotic woman's song. The exotic woman is always naked, tanned in the sun, like paper that has been dried up. She sits atop a tree and sings, when she stops singing it is because she is mating with another man. </p>
<p>He knows there are other men, but he keeps going back to her. The other reason she stops singing is because there's a predator, and she needs protection. But because there is no sound, you don't know which it is, so he goes there one time after she has stopped singing, and she is there in the trees, moving, secretively. Involved in a private act. The other man's face looks like a monkey, but she probably thinks he is the most handsome.</p>
<p>Later the man finally gets to her. Then afterwards, when she stops singing to give him a baby, he regrets it. Why did he do this? It's the biggest thing, and he was so foolish. And he looks into her eyes and her smile and doesn't see the same affection any more. He writhes when he realizes he threw his life away because of her song, that no one even listens to anymore, it's a thing of the past. He asks around and no-one knows the song, or what it meant. And he is too far away from his family or loved ones to go back.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to put this in a children's picture book style thing, but for adults. He asked me if I thought it would sell. And it's strange to ask someone you don't know something, something so private.</p>
<p>The story sounded like BPD, taking dangerous risks, and then regretting it afterwards. Then the man tried to sleep with the store keeper. The customer complained of sexual harrassment when he was rejected, not because he tried to touch her, but because she wasn't ready, if he had done it a bit later, and got his timing right; or if he had a visible six pack, then she might be ready.</p>
<p>I remember him saying, “There's strange music in my head” We both knew it was her song, it kept coming back to him like a rain. He apologized to them, if the voices speaking to him  are too loud for them. “Sorry I can't do much about it.”</p>
<p>“No, no that's okay, you're crazy, we get it, that's all good, I'll just give you some space alright.” he says it so instantly, like he's experiecned guys like him before. He didn't need to think about it before saying it.</p>
<p>R13:</p>
<p>I'm texting you, I'm not saying anything, I'm giving you my trust, that you'll read it and respond and you'll benefit from it, that's what communication is, isnt it? </p>
<p>She never replies to his texts, but when he meets her she's always singing. When she's not singing she's actually really mundane.</p>
<p>Texting people, some just don't reply, like E, or are very late to reply.</p>
<p>He hopes that after she has the baby, she will start singing again, because he realizes he fell in love with a singer, not a woman. Because a real woman has real troubles and real achievements and accomplishments, a singer only performs what she wants to hear and what her audience wants to hear and then she is done. He hopes that she will start singing, then their marriage can be salvaged. But the baby stole her mother's voice. The baby sings so beautifully and the mother, instead of feeling normal, has become a blank face. But everyone knows that something can only be fixed because there's a lot of them. Everyone knew that about people</p>
<p>He also became afraid that he is the only one talking, and she isn't supporting him as much? Maybe? But they show their love in different ways.</p>
<p>“She was a thief” he said, “She was involved in a heist against me. 'Heist' and all of the things people are saying, and doing...etc. It had become a popular word in everyone's vocabulary. He said how there were a lot of thieves about these days, and he should watch out for it as well. A lot of these thieves look like normal people, say everyone's words without guilt, and smile and show kindness. But nothing they say can you trust.”</p>
<p>R19</p>
<p>See Mummy and Papa's conversation, how I haven't produced anything in four years for artistic things, etc. That's how they see me, as an artistic failure and a rebel who wants to do things his own way. But in their eyes he's just another child in the world who's struggling and they're worried about. He is stressed about that, and is thinking about it while he hits on these women. Everytime he flirts and says they are pretty and they smile, his stress is gone, and everytime there is progress, his stress disappears.</p>
<p>Older colleague saying things in the store,
“I'm sick of telling her that my semen isn't gluten free”</p>
<p>The guys around us laughed awkwardly. Us mates knew each other well, so we knew what would happen if this joke went beyond us, if it leaked into the ears of other listeners.</p>
<p>Also because she had his balls in her purse, so if she wasn't happyu she just reached in her bag and gave them a pinch with two pointy fingers.</p>
<p>The jokes with C, the weird stuff that they talk about and joke about, like it's funny or something. The one really funny joke he had, that I laughed about, perverted, unexpected as well.</p>
<p>He doesn't laugh, he just shrugs and sighs, he acts disappointed lol.</p>
<p>About threesomes, “Don't look at your best friend and smile”</p>
<p>MC says tell him “I don't need to, because I am already smiling at him. </p>
<p>Then he says about not being my best friend, then I say he is my best friend, but I may not be his.</p>
<p>Then about two girls instead of two guys, etc. All sorts of things and he said something unexpected.</p>
<p>“You know, I think we could become really great friends, and I could go over to meet you there”</p>
<p>S also says things, pretending to be angry etc. Ignores me, because I said we're not friends “Who are you?” she said.</p>
<p>All the time we are joking. She is talking with the other chef as well, but different kind fo conversation, she laughs about things. As soon as she enters the room, the dynamic changes and people are saying different things.</p>
<p>A customer at the shop, she was talking to one of the housekeepers as well. She pointed up the mountain, “Where is the cable car to the top? Can you tell us? Why don't you have them? Europe has them” </p>
<p>Like Europe is another person...</p>
<p>R6</p>
<p>Customer entered the new place, this hotel for the first time. She stretched out her legs in the seat after the long bus ride. Up to now she ahd been using her eyes to observe the scenery,now she wanted to use her hormones to catch a man.</p>
<p>She walked in the foyer and immediately saw her target. She started getting with one of the porters, asking him to come out at night to her room, her friend explaiend to everyone that she was looking for some fun tonight. And she was tipsy and flirting with him, he was conservative, he raised his ahnd and said no, he's working, and he doesn't want to lose his job.</p>
<p>But she's adamant when she visits him, she's a lot older and wants the taste and energy of a younger man. She wants to suck all of his energy into herself and become a superwoman. Partly to prove to herself that she still has it, and partly to feel young again. She's a highly renowned journalist and an important customer in the hotel. They know she will be reviewing them. They want her to be satisfied, in all walks of the visit. And her flirtatious and scandalous ways have not evaded their ears.</p>
<p>She orders room service, and the porter's friend delivers it...it's so awkward for him, because he knocks on her door, lets himself in, and sees his porter friend and this woman...he sees it and tries to act normal, it's not cheating or anything, but he feels betrayed and he is jealous, he knows that if he were in that position, he would do the same.</p>
<p>He notices his porter friend is doing this like he eats steak. The friend goes home and relieves himself as well, finding his own way to do so. The sexual frustration is passed on.</p>
<p>The journalist walks into the store and sees one guy who doesn't want to be there surrounded by cheerful and caring women. He looks like a misfit, a sunflower facing the other way, to the moon.</p>
<p>R7:</p>
<p>About the reporter that one fo the guys sleeps with? By being with an older woman they can elarn more about the world. </p>
<p>In the depths of the night, she tells him her fears with blank tears that contain no emotion. And as she cries, he thinks how she is a flower that is going to die out soon, it has started to wither. But he doesn't have the strength to walk away from it. Going toward it is easy, but on closer look the petrals are not clean, and they are starting to sag. Even so, walking away from it is too hard. The flower cries that these passers by walk past it, finding newer flowers that are younger and more beautiful all around it.</p>
<p>But the flower only begins to cry after each passerby has gone on already.</p>
<p>R8:</p>
<p>Traveller has to travel around with backpack 24/7 wherever he goes.The baggage never disappears.
This is her pillow talk</p>
<p>R3:
Night porter, talk to her, her job is so relaxed and then go on a tour around the village with her, she shows her routine, and picks someone up, and the person was supposed to go to work, but instead just hangs around because he is there, so she is interested.</p>
<p>Customer R10:
Beneath all of the actions is a straightforward thing, and then a fool who stirs it? If there were no fools, then there would be no problems in the world and everything would be straightforward. Then the good people wouldn't have to suffer.</p>
<p>A rebellious American lady says, “I know how it works, Some boss somewhere tells you to do something, and then you have to.”</p>
<p>“I know, I agree with you, it's stupid, but what can I do now.”</p>
<p>Then the boss says other things to make you do things, but it actually doesn't make any sense, and no-one is happy with it, MC gets told off for following along with it by the customer, he said that he has no relation to it, but these guys won't listen!! And then finally someone related comes over and says it's fine.</p>
<pre><code>MC:

He leaves the area and his friends, and secures a really good job that his ex coworkers are envious of. But instead of working and being successful, he gets paid a lot, he finds himself thinking of wanting to travel the world and not wanting this job, it's boring and he's had enough.But others around him are so envious and want his job and the security and the opportunity to travel the world that he hesitates whether or not he's making the right decision. He went through five interviews and was chosen for it....who goes through five interviews for something like this? He thought that if you went through five interviews, it was supposed to be fun.

And he feels like he should keep the job, just for their sake, etc. People are having a hard time finding a job, and on some level he feels proud and capable for hodlign this job when no-one else can.

R6: In the company
Working above a bunch of women, some were passive-aggressive. Some were bossy.
One woman is doctoring her time sheet. Shouldn't be coming in early, and shouldnt' be leaving early. Her coworkers don't know how she can lie and cheat so much and be in the system.

Then one evening when theya re all gettting changed from uniform, she is there with them one time. And they see that she is slim, and actually really hot. 
</code></pre>

<p>Ah, so that's why. </p>
<p>It's simple, she's sexier than us.</p>
<p>Boss is diplomatic, he has been a manager for a long time. Tell her something and it never gets done. For three months he repeated it to her, but nothing happened, she bounced out of work happy to go home afetr a busy day doing nothing.</p>
<p>And he won't confront her with the issue, the women will talk about her behind her back and complain to everyone about her, but it won't do anything. </p>
<p>In her previous job she ripped the company off. But she's fine because her bosses are always men.</p>
<p>R7:
What he said, it's either a really profound concept, or so normal that there's no point discussing, I just don't know which it is. He's either a kid, or a really mature person. But most of the people I ask say that it's not a big deal, so I guess it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>“What most of the people think doesn't matter, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but what I think doesn't matter as well, I think”</p>

<h3 id="forty-five-ominous-and-a-bit-weird-hotel-customers">forty five: Ominous and a Bit Weird. Hotel Customers</h3>
<p>This was the final chapter before the heist. They had done all the preparation and organized everything, they have had weird classes and weird jokes, made new friends and gone through a lot for this, and now it was really starting. Now it's not counting down more days, this morning he woke up and this was really it!</p>
<p>Most people were content and satisfied with what they had, not wanting more. It's like the feeling after sex. Whereas before sex everything is desperate, and movement is extreme. </p>
<p>The camera was at a distance, skimming past rows and rows of houses, it moved across smoothly, not attracting attention, yet being so machine-like in it's constancy. We could see the houses , rows of houses on street, and zoom in and in until you see two people already at it and doing it like two frogs they move faster and faster like two plants blowing in the wind; and then finish. Stand up and cook dinner, or prepare to go to work. It's like they have woken from a dream and are now acting normal again.</p>
<p>It was so much pointlessness of all the sex and the lust. He had spent the whole night trying to hook up with a woman, any woman, and at the end felt like it was a waste of time and was so pointless. This hunger that directed them all towards something and controlled them, he looked at all fo the people and wondered if they were hungry, because they didnt'; look it from the outside. He looked at all his female prospects, analyzed their details and behaviour at home. And then he saw so much variety and possibility of differences, and he got scared and just gave up. </p>
<p>Then he climbed a mountain behind his home. For a while there were no people in his life. He saw two lovers walking far below him, hugging each other and whispering. From here their passion and love looked so small and useless. He saw people copulating behind a Manuka bush with white flowers and black stems, their legs were moving and she was moaning. To someone else they might get mixed emotions, how did the participants feel? They had no idea there was anyone else, that there were other heights and other people living their lives.</p>
<p>And he looked above him, the stars were far above him, much further than the distance that he was to other people and already felt distant.</p>
<p>He knew that she was a customer, and he was a porter, and she had taken a liking to him for some reason and was getting with him. He knew this because it was 'important' apparently. On observing them, generally after she touched her hair with her right hand, and he rolled over and stores his goods away, the woman would smile 26% of the time, and 34% of the time she would mean it. Yet only 15% of the time, she would enjoy it. Once the context was set up, it allowed for fats repetition of this process.</p>
<p>Then in the room next door to their room, a family was trying to sleep, they were all asleep, but the son woke up and heard animal sounds coming from the wall, he got excited by it and started touching himself, wishing he were older and could be doing these things to women as well. One day he could run his hands over them. 
He woke up in the morning with stern parents asking him why he ahd his hands in his pants, and telling him that it was inappropriate. Then his mother started crying to her husband because she felt like her son was right there, yet he was growing more nad more distant from them both. The husband just hugged her and did everything in his power to stop her from worrying.</p>
<p>They didn't know it, but the couple next door had been so passionate to have sex, they spent the whole night excited for it, she had spent months making excuses to her husband, and he had organzied the perfect 'business trip'. After they both worked towards it, planning for it, then suddenly it was released and meaningless and worthless, don't know why they did it. Why did they waste their whole night planning for this? Why did they leave their spouses in their respective towns to run here to deump some liquid? It was unclear right now.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger was gay, he had three older brothers, and with each older brother the likelihood of him being a fag increased 33%. So it was almost certain that he would be gay. From young he wanted to dress in women's clothing and wear his mother's shoes. He liked sparkly things that were polished and he tried hard to never hurt anyone's feelings. At work today, he was the most manly man, and the women were shocked, they thought if there was one person who wasn't gay, he would be that one person who was as straight as a chopstick. If even he had given in to the assaults of manly passion and turned gay, like an apple that grow rotten given enough time, then any guy could possibly turn gay, at the drop of a hat. It was like gayness was something that was a result of too much time collected in one person.</p>
<p>“But you're married” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“No I'm not. Who said that” Mr. Danger said. “I'm curious now”</p>
<p>“Oh weren't you?” She got the person wrong, and was now feeling embarrassed. Actually it was a different gay man who was married.</p>
<p>“Are you gay?” she asks the next guy she came across “But you're married” he mocked beside her.</p>
<p>“And now, to top it off, I've lost interest in my girlfriend, it just kind of fizzled out. And she feels it, and I can tell she wants to cheat on me before I cheat on her.”</p>
<p>“That's horrible, what's wrong with you people?” she said. As if his gayness was a sickness. “Just shake it off, control yourself, because you can't control yourself you're ruining other peoples' lives”</p>
<p>A customer of the hotel passed by, he saw this and head the conversation. He though how nonsensical it was, how stupid it was that she behaved like this, how they were both doing the wrong thing to justify something that wasn't even a problem in the first place. He remembered his own story from home.</p>
<p>Every time his daughter with this man, they went to the cafe and talked, something changed in his daughter, for a week or so she became a different person after talking to him at the cafe. She turned quiet and introspective and unresponsive, and she dressed up more and was concerned about her appearance. Her parents were afraid that she was catching the 'woman' bug, which was so very common. But the father breatehs deeply and prays, and finally decides that it's alright for his daughter to behave like this, it's not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Her Mother was happy that her daughter was growing up, but her father was afraid that his daughter was becoming vain and forgetting her own family and the values they had instilled in her.</p>
<p>“She won't forget her values” she's a good girl. His wife said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the man got a ten minute break, then charged back into her. They both kissed and smiled and laughed every now and then before becoming involved. She was paranoid about him using a condom, he has to use one, otherwise she really doesn't want his baby.</p>
<p>He was confused, he actually doesn't want to be with her anymore, but this makes him feel like it's her dumping him, and not him dumping her. And he reached out, her body, everything there was his, he could do whatever he wanted with it.</p>
<p>While the customer walked past, he was thinking this. It only took the time from one doorway to the next, or just swinign the bathroom door open, and when it closed he was already thinking about something else. It was because he was so used to thinking about it that it flowed freely in his mind like an electric cable that had been planted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, William went upstairs into administration to deliver the daily invoice reports, he did this every day, but today he saw that most of the time these office desks are empty. Who was actually doing work here? </p>
<p>But then the GM walked past and greeted him. It was polite, but it was also a sign to show that he was checking everything thoroughly, the taxes, the alarm system, the security cameras, and he walks past and greets everyone. He sat at his office desk and stared at two screens, one was work material, the other were all security cameras. When he was dissatisfied with something in the cameras he phoned the department and asked them to change it immediately. When workers had their hands on the desk in the store, or when they didn't have their hands on the desk a reception. When one employee hadn't smiled three times in a row. He knew how often people smiled, and how oten they didn't smile.</p>
<p>“Were going to be seeing him in thirty minutes” Mr. Melancholy said, and everyone fell quiet. It really was starting, they had planned it for all this time, and now it was really starting. It still wasn't too late to turn back, they hadn't done anything yet.</p>
<p>And the clocks finally stopped ticking at night. Dyring the day it was like someone has come in here just to turn on the clocks.</p>
<p>“Be confident” Mr. Angry put his hand on Mr. Melancholy's shoulder, “It's alright, we'll pull through this fine. Because if we don't, we're dead” </p>
<p>“Thanks, that's some really great encouragement mate.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy looked around, he knew what it was now, for a while he had been feeling something in his stomach, uneasy. He felt like a huge distance was growing between things. This group that had solidified, they had become closer with each other, but the result was a disparaging from other people. Between them a huge distance was growing, yet they still hugged and talked about everything. It was weird, and it woudln't last. They all knew where this was leading, but neither had admitted to it yet.</p>
<p>He has started thinking of other girls, in his past. And she is re-considering the other guy's offer to her. She has so many offers that she carries around in her handbag, a guy writes down his characteristics and his phone number, and she reads over them, she receives a new one and goes to the cafe, excited to finally read it!</p>
<p>She visited one of these men, she knew her friends woudln't approve of him, so she kept it a secret. Her friends would say “What are you doing Stacey? Why are you ruining your life? Do you not have any sense?” So she wouldn't show them, and she would do it like they all did, just hide it, then it never happened right?</p>
<p>He was called William, and he told her a messed up story. She sat next to him on the floor, they both leaned against the bed. He had paper in his hand and a pencil,a nd he drew his ideas out. He said it was about a thing giving a human the most money in the world, in exchange for his soul. 
“Why does this thing want his soul? You didn't explain that” she said.</p>
<p>“To this creature, human souls are rare things shaped like small humans. The human wonders what this creature that wants his soul is, but the wonder falls short and he is eventually blinded by the glow of the gold right in front of him. He could wait for an answer, and still get the gold, but he needs it now. He has to have it now. He has always wanted to buy stuff for his girlfriend, so she will like him. So after travelling for two and a half years, at this intersection, he meets this creature. It is wearing a black hood with big words written across the front. And it speaks slowly but carefully, you know each word is etched into its tongue. </p>
<p>“If you give me your soul” the creature said, “I will give you incredible amounts of gold, you can buy anything you will ever want, feel every emotion and experience everything. It's all yours.”</p>
<p>The human thought about it, he meditated it over the weekened and finally came to a transcendent state beyond himself and agreed to it. He gave this creature his soul, the creature accepted it like an fragile ancient manuscript that might break if it were mishandled. The man saw his soul going into the creature's pocket. He waited.</p>
<p>The creature was gone, it had disappeared like sand in the wind.</p>
<p>And after an hour he realized it was a scam, the thing didn't have a cent of gold. And next time he saw another person, he gave them sound advice, he said that if they were travelling and met this creature, not to go for the gold, never trust him. </p>
<p>But the other person stared at the man, he didn't recognize him, because he has no soul. “Who are you?” He said, “How come you have no soul?”</p>
<p>The man remembered how he had met a man like himself before, this man also, had no soul and was talking to him, but he hadn't recognized him and didnt' believe him.</p>
<p>Eventually, over manmy years, and many souls lost, the legend spread, if something offers the purest most beautiful gold to you, then don't take it. If you see that one, then don't take it, because it's a scam, everyone knows it. But if it's the second best, or the third best gold, then you can accept it no problem. Just the highest quality of anything, don't ever accept it.”</p>
<p>William had finished his story, his pencil stopped moving, and his drawing stopped becoming created.</p>
<p>Then she asked him an interesting question that left him dumbfounded. For some reason her strange question was something he understood, and it really astounded him to hear it. “What do you think? As the creator of this story I would like to ask you, whether confidence or a human soul, which of the two is more important and rarer.”</p>
<p>“Those are two different qualities of men. One is much greater than the other, why are you comparing them like they're the same thing?”
“But if you caould only choose one”
“It's a bad question, it doesn't make sense you can't compare two thigns that are completely different, they're so different that you don't know where to start. It's like comparing fragile human emotions, to a computer. Where do you start?”</p>
<p>“I would say confidence is more rare than a human soul” she said. </p>
<p>“Sure” he said.</p>
<p>And she was dissatisfied at his lack of intellectual stimulation and bonding. He didn't say things that made sense and asked common sense questions. She just wants to strangle him in her frustration. And yet, he told her the most beautiful stories at night, somehow. And she couldn't let go of that. If she could somehow just be with him at night, and be with someone else during the day, then it might be awesome.</p>
<p>William spent his time with her more commonly, he forgot about the other girls, and things were going good every night. Until she heard something about him from one of their mutual friends. And she started to feel differently about him. He didn't know what exactly she heard, because she heard all sorts of stuff. But her response was the common cryptic one that strangeld relationships to death, silent treatment. </p>
<p>Then she invited him back to her apartment one evening, and after she opened the door with the key and let him in, he saw it right in the middle of the room, while her key was still hanging from the keyhold. She had a big brick of gold on the carpet. Like some animal had taken a huge dump, it was the most sparkly gold he had ever seen. And all his past selfishness comes back, and he forgot all about who he was and what he was doing, and his past ego resurfaced, and a part of him couldn't resist the gold. </p>
<p>“How come you have this gold in your room?” He coudlnt' stop staring at it.</p>
<p>“It's my treasure” she said, “I really like gold, so I collect it and polish it every day.”</p>
<p>“Why do you have gold?” </p>
<p>Now she was confused, she had just answered.</p>
<p>He kept his gaze on the gold, what if it wasn't the most sparkly gold that is bad news? What if it was a good one?</p>
<p>“Do you want it?” she said. “You're here with me now so it's okay”</p>
<p>“But it's important to you right?”</p>
<p>She nodded, a bit cluelessly, “It's important, but so are you, and if it's gold or you, I can choose easily”</p>
<p>“It's so beautiful” William went up and touched the gold, stroking it like the fur on a teddy bear. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Sure” she nodded, “If you give me your soul”</p>
<p>He decided to forgo the gold, he was a good moral person, and if they were able to steal this gold in the heist, then they wouldn't need anything. He was surprised she had it in her easily accessible room, how come she has it? </p>
<p>“It's just a joke” she said, “It's because there's a creature that roams the halls at night. Every night it roams the halls and sometimes, I don't know why, it leaves these things in my room. I dont' know where it got this gold from, but if it's missing, it will get angry and eat me, so I have to leave it here”</p>
<p>When she explained herself, he trusted her more and wanted to be with her. She was intriguing and very quirky. Yet she was dangerous and spontaneous at the same time. He really had no idea what she was thinking, and what she wanted.</p>
<p>“So what if I take a small piece of it? No one has to know”</p>
<p>“No no” she shook her head and fingers, “It will notice, please don't.” She went to look at the door, there was a peephole that she poured her gaze through. “The creature will come back tonight to come get it. But if it notices humans watching, it might not be very happy.”</p>
<p>“Why does it store things here?”</p>
<p>She pulled William over to peer through the peephole, he looked through and saw the wall opposite, it was a small section of the corridor that they could see. “How should I know?” She raised her hands up to him, “I'm not the thing, don't ask me. It has some strange habits, every night at 4am it walks along the corridor, pacing it, and if it sees a human, it eats them. And when it finds something it likes, it stashes it in someone's room. We all know about it and what it does, and when it appears. But we don't know a lot, like where it goes afterwards, or what it actually eats. Why is ti fascinated by gold, and where the thing originate? </p>
<p>William thought about it, maybe he could use this monster to help them steal the GM's treasure. He doubted the monster knew about it, itwas an extremely well kept secret. Only Daniel knew about it. If the monster stole the chastity belt it would be anticlimactic. But they wouldn't risk anything to get to it. He wondered if they could communicate this to the monster. </p>
<p>“I've never seen it” She said, “In case you were wondering” Now she had the wardrobe door open and was rustling through her clothing. He wasn't sure if she was doing this because he was here, or because she did this regularly, but watching her do this was strange as well. How come she talked about such a strange thing in such a normal way? Did she attract these things because she herself was strange as well?</p>
<p>“What if you open your eyes on time” he said, “And you see that it has pimples and wrinkles all over it's face like rivers, and eight or nine eyes, all looking in different directions. And it has horns with blood riddled all over them, and it's got saliva drooping from its mouth, the saliva is so thick that it...”</p>
<p>“Enough, enough” she put her hand up in front of him, and held her head away, “Please don't say any more”</p>
<p>“If it was like that, I'd be scared”</p>
<p>“I don't care” she said, “I lived with it all my life, if it goes or stays, my life doesn't change, sometimes it's the only company I get all day” </p>
<p>she doesn't care, but she decides to follow this dream he has, she will trust it. “I don't want to look”</p>
<p>William stared at the big lump of gold, the longer he looked, the more flashy it seemed to become, and the more he was attracted to it. He wanted to put it away somewhere he could keep it safe and all for himself. “Let's take it” he said. “This creature can't be that dangerous”</p>
<p>“Oh it is” she laughed, her hands between her legs and moving them impatiently, “I can affirm that”</p>
<p>But they talked about it for so long that they both became serious. Why couldn't they take this gold? Gold didn't belong to anyone, besides, the creature probably stole it as well. They decided to steal the gold, so that they could live like all the others who come here, without slaving themselves to do so. They agreed to steal it in the morning, afetr the monster had come to check.</p>
<p>“I want to see thie creature, I'm curious”</p>
<p>“It might scar you” she said.</p>
<p>Then the monster came in the morning, it unlocked the door. William looked up and saw one of the  managers, he took the gold bar and put it away, looking relieved. </p>
<p>The manager looked around, then left.</p>
<p>When she woke up to see the gold gone she said. “See, the monster came to take his gold, and if it wasn't there he would bring out even scarier monsters to find it, aren't you glad you left it?”</p>
<p>And he said “Did you notice the gun in my pocket from earlier? That's the head of a monster pointing out.”</p>
<p>In the next meeting, everyone assembled in the usual way. It was becoming mundane now, an eyesore. Mr. Angry informed them that this was to be one of the last meetings. “There's nothing else after this” he said. “Forget your personal grudges, personal issues, miniscule issues, and unsmiling people, yoru best friends, the people you wish would admire you more. The girl you never slept with but wish you had and regret it, people you hurt, fake people around you, and tears that don't relieve anything.” He breathed out heavily, with wheezing breath and painful ideas that seemed to assault him relentlessly. The team were listening in freely, and they saw it. If they hadn't had any respect for Mr.Angry, now they did. “Right now is all about now, these next few hours are where we will either live up to our dreams or die. I'm going to be honest, as I've been this whole time during the heist. Some of this is in our control, some of it is beyond our control, but we have to try our best to do these things. These moments will decide it.”</p>
<p>And everyone saw that it was the last.</p>
<p>Slowly, the speech was digested into the hungry stomachs of all the crew. It was Mr. Angry at his most sociable and most strong. Then they all put their hands together and cheer. Everyone knows what they are doing, everyone is determined, everyone has put everything they have into it to risk it.</p>
<p>William really respected Mr. Angry, and he disrespected corporate culture and his managers. He was a womanizer, it was all unhealthy, but he didn't realize it. He heard the speech and clapped. He always thought the women around him are too focused on well, him, to think about anything else.</p>
<p>Each member clapped for their own reasons, and each clap let out different emotions. If we could measure it with an emotional-meter, then surely we would only see the traces of Greed binding them here together. These members probably wanted something more lasting than greed, and that was what kept them together here.</p>
<p>“We'll have one more meeting, and then the heist happens” Mr. Angry said. His hands were in his pockets, he had everyone captivated. “And then we'll go our own ways</p>
<p>Own Ways, it sounded like something so far away. What did William have to do on his own anymore.</p>

<p>“Where do you get all these ideas?” Jeena said. “It seems so realistic, almost as if you've experienced it before”</p>
<p>“It's just something I think about” William's answer was a prevarication. He didn't want to betray too much knowledge. William said.</p>

<h3 id="forty-seven1-final-part">forty seven.1: Final Part!!</h3>
<p>Part 2: FINAL TALES OF EACH CHARACTER:</p>
<pre><code>(Tales describing and fninishing the heist for each character, not the camera moving here and there, and before the end it stops, and we see the heist, then go back to each character's end of story)
</code></pre>

<p>Each member had twelve hours before the next meeting, and when they walked out of the next meeting they would start the heist. SO they engaged in activities and met friends, before everything was going to change. </p>
<p>It was still going to be human actions for them, but they would mean very different things.</p>
<p>WILLIAM/Mr. Melancholy</p>
<p>Jason and William were talking about Daniel's place of no return deep inside. It was an inspired conversation weighed on the demanding topic hanging above them.</p>
<p>“Yeah I know that feeling” Jason laughed, he never got anything William was trying to say but laughed about it casually. William felt misunderstood, and Jason felt that William overthought everything, and he made jokes to imply it. “It's called the womb, it changes you, it introduces you to, you know, life?” </p>
<p>But they both never talked about it. They never got to that level of interaction...</p>
<p>Annalise and William finally had a good chat, she was waiting for it for some time now. It clarified her insecurities of whether he liked her, and what he was doing with all of these girls.</p>
<p>“I've thought about it a lot and am wiling to compromise” she said, “What do you think if we kind of turn a blind eye to each other's 'adventures'. </p>
<p>William shrugged, “Nah, no thanks” </p>
<p>“What do you mean? She walked over, he was sitting and she was standing, her legs were in his vision. “So you want to be together exclusively?” Her tone was joyful, he could hear her excitement.</p>
<p>“Nah, it turns out I'm not interested, not even vaguely so” he said.</p>
<p>“What if we both survive the heist” she said. “Then would it be okay?” Annalise was a proper religious woman, she had never been tempted into anything like this, ever. She had only joined because she heard it was easy money, and she knew it might be a teeny bit illegal, but everyone did something illegal once or twice in their life right? Everyone was a liar, it depended on how far down you were willing to go to see it. After a while going further down was pointless, everything had to have a contextual meaning to their daily and social lives.</p>
<p>William told her one day, “All these hours, while we sit here and discuss things, while we do all of these things, other people are all asleep. And while we sleep during the day, they have been working the whole time. It's hard to believe isn't it, the difference in peoples' lives. Each of us looks the same on the surface, but inside we're completely different, we have our own passions. And while one is struggling, the other is oblivious. That's just that we all are occupying ourselves, and we interact with those similar to us. So what are we all living for?”</p>
<p>She didn't know why, but when she walked along the street, or finished work, or went to the bathroom, his words seemed to float up in her mind. And she fell over in tears, missing him dearly.</p>
<p>“But that's just us, in this country. If you look at the globe, there are others awake and walking and talking and laughing and joking now, and working, on their careers, relationships with loved ones, and lives. Then when you see this, isn't the world big?” Annalise sank back in her chair, looking up at me, she had to kept moving her arms to keep her from sinking in. “Mr.Angry said it to me, and it was really quite scary, but he said the world's so big, that's why we need to do something here, now, to find it for ourselves” </p>
<p>“I'm not really sure I know what he means” Annalise said. William stared at her in disbelief,</p>
<p>“You don't know?”</p>
<p>“Because I'm here” she said. “The world isn't that big now is it”</p>
<p>That was as far as it went.</p>
<p>“I don't” she said, “But I think if I knew that, then somehow we'd be very different people and the world would be a very different place. We might not be together.”</p>
<p>Wiilliam didn't know what she was saying, he was always independent and self sufficient. But at that moment he knew that if she left and disappeared now his world would fall apart. She stood there against the railing overlooking the river, tilting her head and watching as the water scrolled past. She was like a robot who had never seen the world before. It was probably her first time, living this life. leaning as if she were having fun, her hands slipped over the railing, leaving a damp mark where the water vapour was cleared. The stars up ahead watched down in envy of her, to them there was a star on earth as well. </p>
<p>And just by admiring her, she was able to hold his world together. And right now, at least for a day, or even just a few hours, he would love her with all of his heart. </p>
<p>And there would be peace.</p>
<p>A few days later, William was lying in bed, admiring those days when he was hanging out with Annalise. They seemed so far away and unattainable. Then a woman he met over lunch told him</p>
<p>“But then I can't contact you, how will I know where in the world you've gone. We can discuss things going on with our lives, you know, relationship stuff” She was another one of the women who he had no idea about. He didn't recollect any interaction with her and he didn't spot anywhere that their paths had crossed.</p>
<p>“I think you've got the wrong idea” he said, “I told you so at the start, I don't want to be contacted, I don't want a barcode phonenumber tagged to me so you know where I am and who I'm with and who I am and what I'm doing, I don't want anyone to know, I'm a private man, not one of these clowns who is tagged by GPS system throughout the world and followed by tweeting birds. I live in the shadows and appear randomly., like the jackpot at a casino, you don't see me much, but when you see me you're ecstatic.</p>
<p>She was shocked, he had said he said this to her before, that it wasn't the first time, but she honestly had no recollection of it. This was the first of it she heard. “So my boyfriend is the grand prize at a casino? You know in one of the slot machiens in the biggest casino in the world, the grand prize hadn't appeared for 24 years?”</p>
<p>“So give me the scissors” he said,</p>
<p>“Why do you want scissors at a time like this, we're talking you know? It's important to share what you're thinking, I tell you everything, it's what we have to do to make this work.”</p>
<p>“So I can unfasten this leash around my neck” he said.</p>
<p>“How come you didn't tell me this earlier? Were you always like this? Or did you just change your mind” She struggled with his dispossession from reality. It was his fantasy that she ahd fell in love with, and now it was his fantasy that was driving them apart.</p>
<p>“I never changed my mind, I don't like you, I was just using you okay?” He said it finally, the weight in his chest felt like it lifted off and blasted off into space. He felt light and if he wasn't careful, would fly. “That's why I don't want to share anything with you, you're like a stranger to me, why would you go and tell a stranger everything? I made a wrong turn and put my key into the wrong keyhole. He said. It was never meant to be.” </p>
<p>She knew what he meant by key and keyhole. “but you said I could tell others” She suddenly felt heavy, like a bright light was shining above her and terracing her shoulders and the tip of her nose. “Is this how a weightlifter feels?” she said, “I see it in the olympics all the time, but I never knew it was this tough”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“What I'm trying to say!” She found herself yelling, “Is that you're a dick, now I have to pass this weight on to someone else, when I tried so hard not to ever get something so ridiculous like this”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? It's my weight. It's personal.” Was that what she was troubled about? It was like no matter what he said to her, some part of logic just didn't connect with her mind, and she coudln't understand it. Some inner part of her was twisted up like a breadroll and just messed up. It took a while to see it, but once you saw it, it was there all right.</p>
<p>“Someone else gave it to you” she said. “When did you last feel hurt?” It became like a doctor pateint relationship, he was amazed, she should be a doctor. Not a cleaner. Well I guess that was a doctor for tidiness.</p>
<p>“I have never been hurt”</p>
<p>“Bullshit, everyone's been hurt, you're hurt the moment you're born into this world. It hurts your Mom too.”</p>
<p>“Not your Mom” William said. </p>
<p>“Yeah it hurts every Mom”</p>
<p>“But not your Mom”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Are you trying to be funny, because if you say anymore it's just rude, don't say stuff about Mum, shes gone through a lot of life.”</p>
<p>“What are you getting offended about?” William said. “Don't you know guys are born from Moms, and girls are born from fathers?</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Are you an idiot? You're joking right, you're trolling, that's what it is, you're trolling me.” She laughed, “That's pretty funny actually, well played sir”</p>
<p>“I'm not” he said, “Everyone knows it, how come you don't?”</p>
<p>She stared at him blankly, then looked down and shook her head“You can't be saved. Let me tell you now how it works, how babies are made...”</p>
<p>The dog walked into the room, looked down and shook its head. </p>
<p>The fan was in the room, they made it face down, then turned it on and it started shaking its head.</p>
<p>“...But that's unfair” William said, “How come all life comes from women? Then men stand around and do nothing?”</p>
<p>“It doesn't all come from women you dipshit, men give half the genes. I'm not saying what's fair, we're talking about what happens, and yes, men pretty much stand around and do nothing. They blink a few times and unplug. Women do all the work in this world, and they're paid nothing for it either. All because of a couple of genes ruling our life.”</p>
<p>“Why are you talking about pants?”</p>
<p>“Pants? What? Oh you mean Jeans...” She looked away hopelessly. He couldn't be serious right? </p>
<p>“William, tell me, just how are you going to give birth to a girl? Have you ever let yoru puny mind consider this?”</p>
<p>“I don't know? it just happens”</p>
<p>“Like magic? That just happens as well.”</p>
<p>“Like I passed through school, it just happened, and I hit puberty and got a huge penis...” She raised her hand for him to stop, </p>
<p>“Enough, please. I don't want to hear about that.”</p>
<p>William burst out laughing, he leaned forward and let his laughter out.“It just happened, and I met girls who are amazing and fun to be with, it just all sort of happened I didn't plan any of it.”</p>
<p>“I'm surprised you talk of education.” she said. “You sound like you've never been to a school. Do you know what a school is William? You know? That place where little magical faeries like you gather around and men give birth?”</p>
<p>“Your Mom should have cleaned out her vagina before she had you” William said. It came so suddenly and was so rude that she started tearing up like she had always been crying. It was so unexpected and such a horrible thing to say. To a girl as well.</p>
<p>William stood there, he had been angry for an instant moment, he had a streak of vengeance and wanted to make her upset. But now that she was crying he regretted it. What had he done, this wasn't right. This was just completely wrong. “Sorry, I didn't mean to, that went too far”</p>
<p>“Fuck you” she said, “Get lost”</p>
<p>“Sorry” he leaned down to hug her, and she freaked and screamed like a cockroach was on her.“get off me, get off me, go away, Ahhh”  </p>
<p>“Look, let me be honest okay? I like to make you angry it's because I'm angry, and I want you to swear and yell at me, because that's how I'm feeling. I'm sorry for being such a lowly man who gives in to his base desires. But I need other to swear at me, it's because I feel like this is how I should be treated by others.”</p>
<p>She stopped crying, then stopped frowning, she felt his arms against her back, propping her up, and it made her feel safe, he could carry her around the world and she wouldn't have a worry, she would never have to walk anywhere alone again. Her frowned dissipated and a spell was cast, she started laughing.” If you could have my baby just by me kissing you” she said, “I would kiss you now” She wasn't joking either. Her laughter wasn't coming from his sweetness, or his funnyness, it was just a surprise.</p>
<hr />
<p>A few doors down, Misty was talking to her close friend, Pearly.</p>
<p>She was sitting on the bed in a matter-of-fact tone and her eyebrows were up. She was telling her friend how the world worked. Most people spent their lives determining the rules that governed life, and then testing these rules, they were all scientists, yet also participants in the same experiment. </p>
<p>“A man does it once and he goes out of control. He goes to all fo the women and tries to seduce them, then she wishes he woudln't, because they used to be so close.” Misty said, “Have you ever heard of this story?”</p>
<p>“Every episode in the story of Misty's life is like that” Pearly groaned and rolled her eyes, her arms were behind her and propping her up. “Your life always goes through the same patterns, I'm used to it already. And I'm going tos ay what I always do in this situation, You guys broke up right? So he's allowed to do that you know? Just like you're allowed to”</p>
<p>“But I don't want to”</p>
<p>“So? It's normal, everyone does it”</p>
<p>“I only have sperm of him in my body, that's it”</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” she says, “You know, when a woman does these things she doesn't have their sperm, I don't have all the sperm of the guys I was with” It survives for  10 years in me. Dont tell them that though, I dont want to scare them away. Because then the sperm will be lonely.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know, but it feels like that. Some guys I've been with, they're nasty”</p>
<p>Pearly started to laugh, it wasn't funny but laughter came naturally “I know what you mean”</p>
<p>“I regret it, I'm like Jeena, what have you done, to myself, yes, in that voice, because that's totally how I talk in my mind”</p>
<p>They both laughed at the mockery.</p>
<p>A few doors down, William was talking to one of the other women in his harem.</p>
<p>“I'm a creative guy” he said, “That's why I have multiple personalities. Today I'm like this and in this mood, tomorrow I am in the opposite mood, for no apparent reason or for whatever has been happening around me...so it's hard for me to commit to one problem and one foundation to build on, when I'm constantly drifting in life. Most people live laterally, moving up, but I move horizontally.” </p>
<p>She nodded</p>
<p>“Doesn't that bother you, I tell you all of my problems, and youj take them all withotu thinking much about it”</p>
<p>She nodded</p>
<p>“It's because they're not big deals, I don't think so” They were huge deals to him, but she didn't think much about...</p>
<p>William didn't even look at her, he was already bored of her before she answered, he had unwrapped the present and wasn't happy with what he saw. He didn't know until the present was unwrapped. But now he regretted it and wished he had chosen a different one. When he went to work the next day, before the heist, he realized something simple.</p>
<p>Every second is shared by everyone, every second something has to happen, you have to be doing your job. The big boss GM had his own time, the time that the whole hotel ticked to. If he was late to work, they found the clocks mysteriously wound back an hour or two in the morning, and if they didn't do this or that, they found more time wound back. It was nothing absolute.</p>
<p>William would have felt worthless if he lost the heist job, The job was taken from one of the members and they felt worthless again, so he was happy to be called upon to do this. But he was also hesitant about it because if they pulled out they might be attacked or silenced, because they were at risk of telling the boss.</p>
<p>When he went for his break, the supervisors and Black got togetehr and discusses him briefly, because they discusses many things, and they were all brief.</p>
<p>“People can come here for something they know they will never see again,”said Black.“And customers increasingly want something unique. William doesn't really help us with that”</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded, she remembered the good experience she ahd with William, and din't want to judge hi too harshly, ultimately he would know who had reprimanded him to the boss. And, she was balancing between a friendship with him that she cherished and really needed, and a job that got her paid. “At first he was adjusting to the hotel life real well. People all looked at me and said 'he's the guy who's adjusting real well'. Then I think he started to want more, he wanted change.” She had to inlcude the last part about William, because Black wanted more information, she could tell. His eyebrows rose when she said something impressive, and it meant that her job security was increasing as well. But she didn't betray any more information yet, letting too much out in one go was social suicide.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven2-mr-chatterboxannalise">forty seven.2: Mr. Chatterbox/Annalise:</h3>
<p>Then when Annalise got the job she must have felt something. She complained and talked discussed it with her Tang, who told her she was overreacting. Then she wanted him to know that she was telling him and wasn't actually looking for an answer, she knew the answer, she just wanted him to listen.</p>
<p>He heard her and fell quiet, and when she stopped talking he said, “Change is made by the powerful, they have to change themselves to change the world that comes after them. But they're also the ones who are most resistant to change in the end.”</p>
<p>He had been waiting for a few days to say that, for the right opportunity to inject it into an open ear.</p>
<p>His point was, she needs to go and do things. She had to live her life and sharpen her skillset, then come back and be of use to society. His point was that he thought she wasn't doing anything worthwhile. It was probably from the way she worked, and from the irrelevant trivial things she talked about all the time.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” Tang stopped in his tracks, had he said too much. Annalise was looking at him like a super fast train was passing her and she was having trouble keeping up with her eyes and neck.</p>
<p>“No, I don't mean who are you, I meant it like in a good way.” She wanted to talk about someone, someone outside of the circle to discuss things with. It made her feel fresh and new, she didn't know why she even joined this hectic group. “I have a boss” she said, ignoring Tang's comments about change and big talk. </p>
<p>“Don't we all?” he said.</p>
<p>“No, this boss, there's something about him that's so dark and horrible. When it's only us two and he doesn't speak, I'm always on the edge of uncomfortable. So, I try to avoid these situations by going to the bathroom all the time. And I sit in the cubicle and think about it, is he hitting on me or not? Why doesn't he say anything? Does he feel awkward as well? Why are his intentions so unclear? Is it not awkward for him? Or is he doing this on purpose?</p>
<p>“Wow” Tang said, “Girls overanalyze this stuff too?” He thought his gender was the only one in the world with worries.</p>
<p>“Of course” she said. “Like, his gaze on me is creepy? He's really violent right, if all the stories are true this might be the end of my life now. And my colleague didn't see anything, she only thought I had diabetes, that's why she thought I went to the bathroom. But actually I went because I had these things in my head to sort out and store away. And also because they were all bitching about the other women there, and it was driving me crazy to hear them go on and on about how she was bad, or she was good, that kind of thing. I'm really gentle, I didn't like the conversation so I left the room. And it was the best thing I could do in that situation, if I confronted them then it might seem inconsiderate and uncaring as well. Sometimes it's really difficult to know what the best decision is. But even after I left, someone else there said I was inconsiderate for leaving the others all the time. Even when I meant good!” Annalise couldn't believe everyone thought these things about her, they were completely wrong as well. </p>
<p>She didn't know it at the time, but another person was so impressed with her, that this was her standard procedure for a negative conversation, it was true, it really was. But he never told her what  he thought, he just let the thought coincide with her existence and left it there for a while.</p>
<p>“I think that relates to your way of loving someone” Tang said. Annalise was surprised by his remark, he hit the nail so hard that it made her sit down and think about it. And become frustrated at having to requestion and redesign her identity.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” she said, “How do you get that from that?”</p>
<p>“You're gentle” she said, “And gentle people will follow others around and do things. But that doesn't mean they're a pushover, in fact they dispense confidence to others like a flower field is full of a beautiful smell of ripeness that it passes to everyone who crosses its path.”</p>
<p>They both came to a conclusion, it was one of those weak and futile conclusions that would not stand the test of time, it would only last for a few more thoughts and brief reccurences in the near future before fading. But at the moment it would bond them together slightly closer than what they had.</p>
<p>“Maybe I'm a following lover. I will follow my man, and support him wherever he goes. I watch him for a while, and if I like what I see, I will stick along, if I don't like what I see, I will leave. And that's really all men want anyway. I will do anything to support him, and will happy if he supports himself and tries to do the best for himself as well.”</p>
<p>“There's something I wanted to say” Tang said, closing the counter and shutting down the tills. Everything was over, it was just to finish this sentence. </p>
<p>Annalise looked over at him expectantly, she was half out the door, with her foot edging ever closer to sanctuary. He felt guilty for wanting to say something. “Never mind, I forgot it” Her look of expectation turned to a faded anger, Why did you make me wait? “I was going to include something about you, but I forgot it. I keep having fears of having forgotten something very important”</p>
<p>They both waved goodbye, “Toodles”</p>
<p>While she walked out the door, she would never know if he really had forgotten what he wanted to say or not.</p>
<p>JASON</p>
<p>In a peaceful sanctuary a few doors down, there was a small cottage. Steam meandered out of the chimney and took the path of least resistance. When it reached a certain height it gave up trying to rise and just disappeared. Onlookers watched as each plume of steam rose and drifted around and went it's way. Then 5% of them wondered if one day they too would be able to drift off like that.</p>
<p>In the hosue was a small table with grazing marks on the edges from when a family ahd sold it to them and they hit the edges while trying to move it into their house. They hadn't realized the extent of the size of their door.</p>
<p>Jason sat facing his wife on a lazy afternoon. They were talking about William. How he was sleeping with so many girls, and how he was enjoying himself and eventually getting to know what he really wants in his partners.</p>
<p>“But he's going to find the answer that we all stumble on” Jason said, “Which is that there's no perfect person, it's all timing and a bunch fo artificial factors thrown in the blender.”</p>
<p>“Really, is that what you think happened here?” Laura indicated the both of them with her finger, she was curious to hear his answer.</p>
<p>“No, I don't mean it that way, baby. I mean that there's no relationship that is perfect, you're always questioning what the other person's feelings are, and your own feelings as well. Even in our healthy relationship”</p>
<p>Laura instinctively rolled her eyes to her top left and thought for a second. Jason gulped, this was a bad sign. It meant she could either lash out, or on a very rare occasion, even agree with him. She looked back with a renewed vigour, “Hmm I guess you're right, it's kind of like that”</p>
<p>He felt himself sigh in relief at her approval. Then he immediately became ashamed for feeling this way. Was his marriage just a union of him seeking her approval and her granting it?</p>
<p>“That's half of human existence, just questioning your relationships with others, friends, what kind of friends you are, and how close you are. Trying to predict whether your'e growing closer or apart, foreseeing any backwards behaviour, and coming out stronger. It's probably also how we evolved intelligence” She said. And she always took it a step further than he saw, and it made him feel small. But it also made him proud to be with an amazing woman like her.</p>
<p>He thought about it, and she watched him thinking, and thought this might be a good time to insert her own thoughts. “You're working everyday, with a whole team, you get to be around so many people, but I don't really, I'm just at home and cooking and vacuuming, boring stuff.”</p>
<p>“But don't you women like to do that stuff?”</p>
<p>“Umm...not really? Who ever said so?”</p>
<p>“I thought...”</p>
<p>“Look” she said, “I know you don't talk to your colleagues about me, they probably hardly know that you have a wife, even if they know about me, they probably think of me as some sort of party pooper who makes you go home instead of hanging out with them. And maybe it's true, but you're not twenty, you're thirty five, and you need to act the part, you can't go drinking with these young girls and stay late and come home half drunk and too tired to ask me how my day was. Well I'll tell you now, my day sucked, it was the same as yesterday, and the day before that, and every other day I've ever known. You're married, don't forget that. If you want to forget that...” her voice trailed off, she had been thinking about it for so long, but it was still too difficult to say.</p>
<p>To Jason, he just witnessed an outburst that he had never imagined possible so suddenly. It was like a high tech car that went from 0 to 90 in a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Anyway, they don't even know my name, I'm just your annoying nagging wife probably”</p>
<p>“Do you know who they are?” he said</p>
<p>“You colleagues?” she smiled amongst the glistening tears, “I can name all of them, the ones you work with, the ones you eat with, your bosses, and your enemies. I remember all the people you know, but you can't even remember our anniversary, and it makes me sad.”</p>
<p>Then, he knew why she was overreacting, today was their anniversary, they had been married for six years. Each year it got harder and harder, like a bad year of crop, each year she more desperately wanted kids and he vehemently shut her down.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, is there anything I can do?”</p>
<p>“See?” she said, “Every year I hope that maybe, just maybe this year he will remember, but you don't give a crap do you? Then you have to come and ask me about it, whether there is anything. Why should I tell you”</p>
<p>Jason had come from a good meeting with his friends, he didn't need this. He clasped his eyes shut as she gave him an earful and spoon fed him reasons as to why he was irresponsible and unreasonable and so immature for his age when other married men around him were reliable and taking care of their wives and moving forward in life.</p>
<p>He didn't want to say she was unreasonable, but he had caught a flair of this when he first dated her, on their first date he noticed her saying something like this, but he dismissed it as something unimportant. How wrong he had been...</p>
<p>“Is there anything else I'm missing, can I help you with something?” Her outburst had finished, so he asked her in a civilized manner, the way two adults should be talking.</p>
<p>She said nothing, “There's nothing” and she smiled, like it didn't matter.</p>
<p>Then he was guttered when he believed her when she said that there was nothing and went back to live his stupid life like she didn't even matter.</p>
<p>He said, “If you have something to say, then say it, stop being silent and angry like a child, I don't know what you want to say, so if you want to say it, then come and tell me like a proper adult. I don't have time for this and I'm not a mind reader. I want the best for you, and you want the ebst for me, I trust you, we've been together a long time” With that, he proudly walked off.</p>
<p>Jason always gave advice to the young ones not to do this or that and to live life properly. </p>
<p>Jason left the house for a 'walk' which usually lasted a few hours, and was unclear as to when he would return. On his 'walk' he met up with some of the members of the heist. He found himself with Mr. Purple. They were walking down the riverside. The last time he had been here, was when they all came here a few weeks ago. He wondered when she had last been here.</p>
<p>“You know Mr. Danger?” she said. </p>
<p>He was glad she was talking so freely and nodded, “Why wouldn't I?”</p>
<p>“Well, I've got so many secrets to tell you” she said, “One of our members... he is more messed up than you think.”</p>
<p>“You mean Mr. Danger?”</p>
<p>She hesitated, “I didn't tell you okay? If they ask me then I don't know”</p>
<p>He laughed, she was quirky, she couldn't hide what she wanted to say either. And she put herself beneath him subconsciouly. She would never insult him. He was starting to get to know her better. And he didn't know her age, but she was probably similar to him. </p>
<p>“So what happened?”</p>
<p>“Well, a few of us don't know if we should still go along with it anymore”</p>
<p>“What did he do?”</p>
<p>“There was a party, and he raped many women into the past. Even his wife doesn't know”</p>
<p>“Mr. Danger is married?”  Jason said. </p>
<p>“Of course?” Mr. Purple looked shocked, “Don't you know?” like everyone knew about it. And that's how Jason saw that her world was actually quite small, these things were big deals to her, but no one else really cared about them. Maybe that was because she was quiet, or maybe that was why she was quiet.</p>
<p>“He's a really nice guy tho” Jason said. Mr. Purple was his age, and she was eligible. He felt so bad even thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Yes, he's really nice, and I think that's how he got the job” she said, “It's easy to trust him, he does what you want and never speaks bad about others, he's a really good person, apart from that one character flaw. Is it fair for us to criticize him based on that one flaw?”</p>
<p>“It's a pretty big flaw though” he thought about it, “Why did you tell me this?”</p>
<p>“I didn't tell anyone else” she said, “Because it would make them think he's a bad person”</p>
<p>“Wow” he was amazed, she was not only really attractive and a similar age to him, but was really nice and considerate as well. Her importance was growing and growing on his list and his wife was being pushed to the side. He didn't know it yet, but when he got home he would feel it, and become confused with who he is and who he wanted to be.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he's actually really nice, and I don't think it's fair to judge someone based on something they did in the past, even if it hurt a lot of people and was like a simulation of the war. I'm sure that he's a good person”
And the next time they were talking to someone, he was tempted to tell someone about Mr. Danger and what he heard, because it made him feel closer to the source of the information, Mr. Purple. He didn't want to say it because of Mr. Danger. And he wanted to ask them if they knew it, because now he felt like Mr. Danger was actually a nice guy.”</p>
<p>At night Jason lay awake, he was supposed to steal something, but he found himself going against it, even though his team members were all so for it. When he heard Mr. Chatterbox say something about it in the meeting, he finally realized that she was right the whole time, they shouldn't be doing this. But he still had to do it, because everyone else was so enthusiastic, and he couldn't confront them and tell them, and he couldn't back out, he was a man of his word. He was different to Mr. Purple, she did whatever she felt at the moment, and she just happened to want to do the heist, she says all sorts of promises and vows with everyone, but broke them off, dates to go somewhere, important promises about things, rumour had it that she was married to three men at once, without them knowing about it. She had no integrity or respect for her own word. She used her words to manipulate everyone, instead of being truthful.</p>
<p>And he may have been respecting her for that...</p>
<p>The next time he saw Mr. Purple, she was walkign somewhere as gracefully as she did. He told her what he had learnt from her, what he could have only gained from her.</p>
<p>“You're a good guy?” she smiled, “I don't think so, I don't know what people have been telling you, but if you steal things, anything, no matetr what the price, no matter if you've been punsihed or not, you're not a good guy anymore. You may find yourself making excuses, oh it's just one time, oh, it's not a major crime., oh it's a gateway crime, but the reality is, I think, you've ruined yourself then and there, The Lord won't look at you the same anymore, you'll have thrown away your nobility”</p>
<p>“How do you know what The Lord will think?”</p>
<p>“I don't, but your wife doesn't either” </p>
<p>“But I can get it back right? If I don't do anythign else, I pretty much have to do this now”</p>
<p>“You don't have to do anything, you make all your own chocies, everyone tells you what to do, and everyone demands something of you, everyone pushes you around and insults you and forces you, but in the end you have your own choice to make, no one else can live your life for you, and you have your own responsibility. That's the beauty and the pain of it really.” </p>
<p>“But don't worry”she said, “I'm the same as you, I'm also pretty bad, I'm stealing with you.” </p>
<p>Jason had a childhood friend called Saturda, he came over from somewhere to visit Jason, who was Mr. Lazy. He suddenly turned up, or it was slightly planned, Jason saw him and tried to talk, but in a few seconds they noticed that they didn't really get along anymore. Their lives had changed and childhood was far away. Saturda and Jason had clicked, and Saturda had rushed over to meet him, but in the rush, they didn't see how distant they were now. And he noticed that it was because of the heist they had chosen to organize and do. It had changed him, and it was only when he stopped that he noticed he had changed. For the worse probably. The vanity had slowly started to surround him, and when he brought his head up to look, it was all around him.</p>
<p>“Just one more” he thought, “And then I can stop it all and live a good life, and help others with this starting money, I promise to benefit the world more than I have taken from it. Besides, the hotel is corrupt and the money spent here isn't leading to any good anyway.” He kept making excuses for himself.</p>
<p>His friend Saturda had become really spiritual and moral, and never swears, never says anything bad about anyone, is sincere, because he can be, and is kind, because there are no worries for him. He has his life organized in an optimistic outlook and is going to work towards it with love of life and a passion for the world. He isn't afraid fo death.</p>
<p>On one hand, Jason wanted to tell Saturda everything, about how his marriage isn't working, about how he is becoming severely depressed because he can't talk to his wife properly and she is expecting things from him that he can't live up to.  And how he is involved in this heist, which at first he saw as an opportunity, but is now becoming a more and more toxic presence in his life that he needs to break away from, he gets panic attacks at night, but he can't withdraw from it, he has to do it now. He can't run away because they will punish him, his boss is a very scary man.
But instead, he acts so kind back, and so perfect, like his life has nothing wrong, and even laughs at his friend when his friend is sincere. Then he thinks to himself at night, his wife's asleep, he's a horrible person, he can't even talk to his ebst friend about his true feelings, is he so afraid? Of his friend judging him from his perfect life? Or just afraid fo admitting to himself that he has issues in his life. He wonders how many others are like him nd smiling and laughing as a cover up.</p>
<p>Then, he thought his friend left, but Saturda comes back, and is cheerfula nd caring, but not ignorant. Then before realizing it, Saturda asks him a question and he finds himself answering, so seriously and urgently, it just all flows out of him, and it felt weird, he felt vulnerable and naked.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, Saturda didn't judge him, he didn't even laughor cry, he just nodded and asked questions. Like it was a normal thing, he understood. He really did. And to know that someone understood, and still had hope in him was enough to make him break down.</p>
<p>Then when he spoke, it felt as normal as the sun rising and falling, and he understood the day and was in touch with it.</p>
<p>“People say a lot of what I'm describing is due to me being lonely, or needing friends” Jason said</p>
<p>“I don't tell my wife this, she thinks I'm a perfect person, I'm afraid she might leave me if she finds out. Or she might go for all the other suitors who are waiting around her.”</p>
<p>He waits for Saturda's advice, but Saturda didn't give any, “It's your decision in life, you spoke to me, so that shows me you're dissatisfied, you need to do something to change your life, don't be afraid to take the big steps.”</p>
<p>Then his friend left to go back home on the bus. It was the natural thing for him to do. But somehow it felt a bit messy and unfulfilled. </p>
<p>After talking to Saturda, he began to develop a strong regret of joining the mission. He was about to steal with the gang of guys. And when he got home his wife said she was so proud of him, and two other friends were gathered, one was a housekeeper, one was a receptionist who was popular. And they both said they heard him play the piano and it was so good and it was so great and grand, and why didn't he try something else like it as well?</p>
<p>These people each had their stressful days at work, then in this house they heard him play and listened to it. One guy took out his earphones, put them away and started doing work while listening to the piano playing.</p>
<p>They clapped when he finished, the sun was still out and everything was beautiful. This house was a noble place and very peaceful.</p>
<p>“Play for us next week again” one fo the guys said. His wife nodded and agreed. He saw the beauty of what they saw in him, and wanted to feel it as well, he really did.</p>
<p>Jasons aw that this was his wife's ploy for him to start becoming more like the other husbands here. But he also saw it as her great appreciation of his talents, and a respect of her husband and showing him off to others. He wanted to be honest, but he couldn't so he took the next step closest to it.</p>
<p>“I can't try anything else anymore, because I have to do something, it's very dangerous, and I shouldn't do it, but it's too late to do anything else.”</p>
<p>They were still smiling, Jason felt a bit of relief at being honest, but then suddenly eh realized, any of these people could hang him out dry and stop the heist, they woudln't allow it if they knew about it, and the panic came in.</p>
<p>The guests looked to Jasons' wife for an undertsnaidng of what he was saying, but her clueless expression was apparent. She really didn't know either.</p>
<p>Then at night Jason, A.K.A, Mr. Lazy told his wife everything. She had been nagging him about it for some time now, “What did you mean what you said back there, it was so strange...and final...you've been acting different, like you're hiding something from me.”</p>
<p>They became quiet, he closed the piano lid and locked the door after the guests had left, he went to fill or empty the dishwasher, whichever he could do. She followed him aroud silently, stepping to and fro, indecisive about what she wanted to do, to ask him or not to talk to him, to go away or to stay. She was obviously conflicted, and a husband of six years should know.</p>
<p>“Are you cheating?” She said, her voice was croaky and it broke his heart because he wasn't able to assure her he wasn't. He was involved in something much larger and dangerous than that. </p>
<p>“I'm not” he said, now he was waddling back and forth. They waddled together, both unable to come to a decision, it was a painful place to be standing in a relationship. And he finally decided to tell her everything, from how it started, to all of his friends, to how they're good guys, to how it was not supposed to be dangerous, and how they would be able to afford anything, everything she had ever wanted. She usually talked to him a lot about a big house they were saving up for, or she wanted to be a teacher at a school. Well they could buy a million dollar house, and they could buy the whole school and she could be in charge of the entire art department and they could send their personal hand-raised ripe kids through it together. If they wanted to learn music, they could, if they wanted to learn science, they could, and if they didn't want to learn, they could lie on the grass and conetmplate the world. They could literally do whatever they wanted, because the school was theirs. No one could take it from them.</p>
<p>“No” she said, “You've got it all wrong, you're taking the money in a bad way” She was standing still now, with a big sigh of relief that had come from realizing he wasn't cheating, to a big anxious smile that wouldn't last long.</p>
<p>“You're afraid of the risks right? These guys are all good, and the guy who's planning it, who's planned it already actually, it's all laid out and risk free, actually, it's so easy that it's almost like they're giving us the money”</p>
<p>She had her hands on her hips and was frowning, “Darling, this sounds extremely dangerous, you're stealing things? How can that be risk free? It's illegal Jason? It's wrong, what's gotten into you? The Jason I know would never do that. What do you mean people are calling you Mr. Lazy, you're not Lazy at all.You're the hardest working man I know, and sometimes you have to destress it with your friends, but that doesn't mean anything bad.”</p>
<p>“It's just a name, it doesn't mean anything.”</p>
<p>“It sounds bad” she said, “I want you to stop it, I want you to leave”</p>
<p>He hesitated before telling her about the one way street. He could tell the truth, “I can't, I could try to leave, but I can't, I know I'll be killed because I know too much already” </p>
<p>But what he actually said was, he lied to her, “I've left already.”</p>
<p>She lightened up and a grin came up. And for the first time he saw her smile again, he had missed it for so long. It wasn't what he was expecting. He didn't need to get a lot of money or buy her expensive things, all he had to do was something so simple, just tell the truth. What he was looking for, for so long, he had finally found. (she looks older after smiling for the first time in a while, but eventually the wrinkles will wear off...)</p>
<p>And she was so happy. At night, he sneaked out and said he had late work meetings to get to, and met the heist team.</p>
<p>He just had been thinking that once he brought all the money back, she will be changed from disappointed, to becoming happy and relieved with all the money and they could do anything, they could put her parents in retirement homes. Or even put themselves and their kids in retirement homes for a century.</p>
<p>He walked out, he teared up a lot now, the emotions were so strong in him/this one and he had a hard time controlling himself and staying sane. As the heist approached, the pressure built up in him stronger and stronger. He wished the day of the heist would hurry up and come so he could be rid of these feelings, and live life properly, never doing something like this again. It was too dangerous.</p>
<p>His wife was an amazing woman who always knews what was best for him. When he was drinking too much, she knew it was because he had too much stress at work, so she put the bottles away and offered herself to him, even though she didn't want to. And she made his work situation better in numerous ways.</p>
<p>When he was smoking, she knew it was because he thought it looked cool, so she put a mirror in front of his favourite smoking spot, and he realized it didn't look cool at all, his skin was only becoming dusty. And when he started the long process of giving up, however many years ago it was, she provided nicotine patches and gum and made sure everything was okay with him, even in the long nights when he coudln't sleep because he was desperate for nictoine, she stayed awake and took care of him. These were actions that were intimate beyond anything he had ever known.</p>
<p>When he was snapping at everyone and causing problems, she knew it was because he was lonely, though he was in a wonderful family, and she was there to accompany him. She invited his closest friends over for him to have a guy's night out with, and he felt relieved and relaxed without knowing it. She knew what was best for him and did so.</p>
<p>She never had time to wear make-up and was always taking care of the family. She supported him through everything. Then she cried so hard to him, because she was convinced he had been cheating, nothing else described his actions to her. But then he comforts her with what he remembered her saying once. He repeated her meanings word for word, until everything really began to make sense to him as well. And she was astounded by his memory and his ability to listen.</p>
<p>Then when he told her what it was, he was proud because he didn't feel guilty for saying it, and because he was able to tell her finally. And he really wished she accepted it.He told her about the heist.</p>
<p>But she didn't frown and she couldn't react, she was shocked by what he said. And he started tearing up because he realized he was so desperate for her approval, she who approved of everything up till now gave him a comfort inside. But this she couldn't approve of. It was too much, it's too bad and lowly. “I would rather you leave me than let me see you do something this bad” she said. And he knew it was a bad thing, he knew he was doing wrong, but that's why he really needed her approval and for her to support him, in his low moment.</p>
<p>“I made a mistake” he said, “I'm a stupid stupid man, making such a bad mistake”</p>
<p>He spoke self deprecating terminology and meanings repeatedly, and she finally saw past her pain and saw his pain. And she saw how it was real shaped, and it looked like a teardrop that had been cast in a metal plaster. She saw his imperfection, sees that he needs help now more than he has ever needed anyone's help in his life. The surface of the plaster was wrinkled with all sorts of ideas and different things happening.</p>
<p>It was a long night in the Jason and Laura household.</p>
<p>Laura sat at home everyday, she thought about when to tell him. When he came back from work he was usually exhausted and not listening, but in the morning he was in a hurry. She waited until it was after they had sex. Then when he collapsed and was panting next to her, satisfied to the bototm of his blood, so that it coagulated into a hard shell in him. Men after sex were reasonable creatures, any other time their mind was consumed. And for her own safety she made sure to keep her husband empty. She tells him the news, hoping that it was good. </p>
<p>“I'm with child.” she said. </p>
<p>He was still heaving beside her like a grand finals winning racehorse that had just been shot after it injured itself and was taking it's last breath from its huge stomach. “Nice. What?”</p>
<p>He told her he was really happy to share this life and bring it into the world together. It's the most beautiful thing. And he stares at her and watches her and is so touched, they stare at each other and are in love. She approved of his words, they were what she was hoping, and even more than she expected.</p>
<p>And they were both happy, but after his wife fell asleep Jason became really nervous, the darkness carved into him an anxiety that looked and sounded like an elephant. </p>
<p>He realized his position.</p>
<p>He wanted to tell his criminal cohorts about it, because, sadly, they were the closest other people to him. But he couldn't, because they shouldn't know anything about his personal life. And they wouldn't say anything about themslevs to him, even when he asked. He said in the meeting “I'm living there, in that house on the corner”
The guys snarled like rats, “Stop telling us where you live, it's none of our fucking business, we don't care about you and you don't care about us” They didn't trust each other, and they were generous about it as well.</p>
<p>When Jason arrived home he started swearing, he complained about what happened in the meeting, Laura was very upset and told him not to use that language, especially now that the baby would be hearing everything. From here on they need to be careful, since words were heard by four ears, not just two.</p>
<p>And as she spoke to him, she felt like the child was bringing them together, they didn't argue as much, and they had purposes in their life. As she thought this, he wondered if he would be able to stay here and raise the child, amongst this heist. And he was filled with regret, why did he say he would join? He never should have said so, it he had just thought about it and not just look at the money. He knew he was going to really hurt his wife. She was the most amazing woman who didn't deserve this.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” she said. “I thought you said, you weren't going to do that stealing thingy”</p>
<p>“Yeah” he lied, “It was just a work meeting, they were talking about promoting me”</p>
<p>And what makes him saddest is that he's unsure of if he will ever see the baby. And he knows his wife is thinking the same, there is a melancholy in her movement. But they both didn't dare say it. There was literally no point.</p>
<p>So they swapped to the next nasty topic,</p>
<p>When he came home she wasalways sitting aroudn doing nothing, whilst he had been working. and he felt he needed to say something.</p>
<p>“What do mean, I've been doing this and this and that” she named a few things, that he never acknowledged. He had to bring out something for her to do, something like this and that, just to keep her entertained, or else she would just sit around and do nothing. He felt like he was on a different level to her, it was like father and child, not like a man and woman relationship.</p>
<p>“I'm only saying this, because I feel the need to say something, do something, show something, to you, to tell you. You're not doing anything right now.” </p>
<p>She smiled and listened to him. “Okay” She was oblivious to what he was saying, she seemed happy with herself any how. “Don't forget that we're human” she said.</p>
<p>She told him that Humans feel the need to show kindness, because that lets them survive, or to hug someone else, or to lie, or to move around, because it's what makes them survive. She said, “You know that?” And it's so condescending on him, and he loves it.</p>
<p>And he wondered how she said this, where did she think of this? She was sitting at home by herself all the time, just waiting for him, where did she go out to get this amazing knowledge? And then he fell in love with her once more again. (Depends on how you say it, “go out to get it”, or “get it”, or “obtain” etc.</p>
<p>GERRY</p>
<p>Everyone knew Gerry was homosexual. He was batting for the other team for a long time, but they pretended not to notice it. And so when he talked about his 'partner' to the team, they were noticeably surprised to learn of her gender.</p>
<p>“You've got a girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“Yeah” Mr. Danger looked around over the top of his glasses, “What?” He knew everyone was overreacting, and he knew why. He wanted to test them a bit. It showed a lot about what they thought of him.</p>
<p>“Like, she's your girlfriend girlfriend?” Mr. Chatterbox said, as if she couldn't fathom that fact.</p>
<p>“Yeah, like you're Mr. Melancholy's girlfriend”</p>
<p>“No...I'm not” she coudlnt' hide it, her blushing was too over the top.</p>
<p>“Does she...know?” Mr. Chatterbox said</p>
<p>“Know what?” he said.</p>
<p>“That you're...” she trailed off, it suddenly seemed really inappropriate to say it, he looked like he would be offended.</p>
<p>“That I'm gay?” Mr. Danger announced his sexuality loud and wide. “She knows, she knew before I asked her out, but she said yes, she'd like to just try it out anyway”</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded...that was kind of random?</p>
<p>“It's true” Mr. Danger's eyes narrowed in memory of a story. “One night she was crying and sad because she was so afraid that I would run away one day, because all of the other boyfriends she has had, the guys she's been serious with, they've either been gay or married or suddenly become 'unavailabe' with the quotation marks. They ran away all of a sudden and disappeared with younger women who are more attractive. And she sometimes feels like Gerry is distant and not thinking about her the same as she is of him. She says she will never get bored of him, but he might get bored of her.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute” Mr. Lazy said, “How old is your girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“You don't ask a woman's age” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“But she's not here, you can tell us” Mr. Danger shook his head, “It's not proper to spill secrets just because the owner isn't around, that's almost like stealing.”</p>
<p>Everyone was astounded again, this was the violent man who caused an uproar, yet he was so kind and...moral...and sane. </p>
<p>“I'll just tell you that she's older than all of you...combined...” </p>
<p>Now he had to be fibbing, their combined age was something like 250 years old...but when they looked up, they saw his face was dead serious.What was this? Was he trolling all of them, if so, this side of him had come out of nowhere.
“Anyway” he said, crossing his legs and resting his head in his hand, his hand on the armrest, and the armrest against the wall, the wall against the back of his neck, and the back of his neck balanced back to keep the chair from tilting too far. It was a Rube Goldberg variation. “Anyway, when the time came, she changed her attitude really quickly, overnight”</p>
<p>Umm...it was weird, no one knew what he was talking about. When what time came? And when what was happening? But they all sat around and nodded like it was normal, like this was compeltely on their mind as well. This Mr. Danger had to bea pretty bad talker to make so many people discombobulated so easily.</p>
<p>“We argued, and no matter what I said, she wasn't touched or hurt, and instead I felt my tears against my cheek. Up close they felt like blood”</p>
<p>The heist meetings had turned into intimate shared discussions of highly private relationships. Everyone felt like naturally sharing the details of their lives. Maybe it was the place, maybe the people, but everyone was thinking.</p>
<p>“Is this a poem you're reciting?” Mr. Melancholy said, “The way you're saying it, monotonously, it's almost like you're just reciting a poem to us. It's all made up isn't it.” He voiced his disbelief in the story and Mr. Danger's attempts at pathos as an insult.</p>
<p>But Mr. Danger wasn't insulted, “Thsi is my life” he said, “You don't know anything about my life, and I think before we all do the job and go our own ways, you should know this about me. Okay, so it's ironic...”</p>
<p>And he dived straight back into it, unbewildered. Untouched. No shame. “And it was ironic, because the one who was always crying, was usually her, but now she coudont' shed a tear, she was the hardest most metallic coldest person, and me, who never cried since I was a snotty kid, for some reason, I have tears that are missing her constantly. Each drop reminds me of the distance between us. Each drop is worth about 25 kilometers. Life is strange like that, your roles keep switching when your'e around someone for a long time. </p>
<p>“This girl, is she real?” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>“Of course” Mr. Danger was unphased. “Why wouldn't she be...”</p>
<p>“Just the way you're descirbing her...” Mr. Melancholy said. </p>
<p>“She's as real as you or me, I don't know how real that is though” he said. “But I'm going to leave her, it was my plan from the start. I'm not going to hesitate even for a bit. Being with her I get sex”</p>
<p>“You don't have to leave her” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>“It's because I can tell, I've done these things before, it's a set-up for the heist, in the aftermath of the heist feelings are ripped apart and huge wakes of all sorts of damage are left behind, like a nuclear bomb sweeping across a town and flattening the place into a pancake. I told everyone, everyone knows I'm going to leave except her, so it's okay.”</p>
<p>“How does that make it okay? If everyone knows about it but her, that doesn't make it okay”</p>
<p>“This heist though” Mr. Danger said, “Everyone knows about it, but those getting stolen from. So it's kind of okay?”</p>
<p>“That doesn't make it okay still” Mr. Purple said, “Just stop talking. Please”</p>
<p>“Even after she confessed all of her vulnerabilities and weaknesses to me. I won't hesitate even for a bit, like everything she has thrown at me, her whole life and trust, and rust, and love, it doesn't mean a thing to me. I will just shrug and walks off, shaking my body like a dog coming out of water, a few shakes and you're clean and unspoilt again. I'll run away from her and she'll never see me again, she'll have no trace of where I've gone. Just out of the blue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox held her hands over her ears and screamed, “Stop it, stop talking” He said it so naturally and so guiltlessly. She was uncomfortable. “She will be convinced that she isn't worth being loved anymore.” she said, “It's the worst feeling the world can deliver you, it's like Here, here's a cold plate of spaghetti that has bene left out and is like oen big ball of pastry, I hope you enjoy it”</p>
<p>Annalise remembered one time she was with a guy, she confessed something to him, and she was wondering why he didn't get angry or upset, she felt so guilty admitting it, but if he didn't react then it wasn't right for her either...something was missing in the transition. And she was admitting it for a reason.</p>
<p>“But it's my policy to throw everything away before it soaks into you. If you don't swim you drown.” Mr. Danger said, kind of on the side, and kind of directly. </p>
<p>He lived his life with that moral, and everytime something came up he didn't understand, he referenced and replayed this moral in his head like a computer using a formula to make decision trees to weight its options. Then he chose what to do.</p>
<p>But no good could come from such a low and simplistic moral code..</p>
<p>DANIEL:</p>
<p>“Did you hear about what happened with Mr. Angry?” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“Again, something happened?” Mr. Purple was half asleep. Which was normal. And she looked disinterested, which was normal. But she wasn't wearing high heels, which was not normal. </p>
<p>“There was a guy Mr. Angry asked, before one of us, to join the heist. SO one of us is his second option” Everyone nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, there was a guy who didn't agree to the heist. And Dan...Mr. Angry was threatening him all the time to join. It wasn't a gentle nudge, it wasn't a statement, it was coersion.”</p>
<p>“What did he do?” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“He cut off the man's balls”</p>
<p>“That's definitiely not a 'gentle nudge' ” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox continued, “Apparently the guy said that Mr. Angry was an amateur who didn't know what he was doing, and that the others shouldn't follow him”</p>
<p>“But surprisngly, Mr. Angry got upset” she said. “You'd think he didn't care about these trivial things, but he flared up like a popsicle and chopped the man's balls off. Apparently, they're still in the rubbish bin in his kitchen. He's a huge criminal, most likely to be doing it again, he's clean now though. But one last job to change everything.”</p>
<p>“This job...” Mr. Lazy said what everyone was thinking.</p>
<p>“I heard that Mr. Angry wanted to be a novelist” Mr. Purple said, completely out of the blue.</p>
<p>“What? He's a criminal”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but his fulfilling work is to be a novelist, apparently” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>“This is a joke right? Now you're making this up just to get a laugh from us”</p>
<p>“No” her shrug was nonchalant, she couldn't care less, “I'm just repeating what I heard”</p>
<p>“Heard from hwere?”</p>
<p>“You know that place, that void where all the 'talk' in the hotel comes from?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that void” someone said.</p>
<p>“I visit it frequently, and it whispers to me”</p>
<p>She was so serious that no one dared laugh to offend her.</p>
<p>“So let me tell my story, it's a story he wrote. He likes stories, that's why he made us tell them last time right?”</p>
<p>There were no voices of dissension, among these criminals, there was a high degree of respect for each other. </p>
<p>“He didn't make us” Mr. Danger said, “We said it by consensus, because we all wanted to”</p>
<p>“Nah, he pretty much forced us, stop kidding, you don't have any freedom or choice” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple started, “There was a woman she does it with a different man to who she's supposed to do it with. And her original man hears about it again from everyone and wants to get her back. And she is willing to get back, but he can't look past this part of her that sleeps around with men almost sponatneously, like a switch changes and she just needs it. Then she says there is a solution, and that's for him to also do the same thing back to her, then it is sure that everything will be fine. He should go and sleep around with three women, just three, she will close her eyes to it, and give him a free pass. They have to sign it on the form she made for him, and then it's all legitimate. And she doesn't want to hear anything about ti from anyone, and when he is done, he can come back to her, but they will never speak about it, she will never ask him about it, but with this they are equal and they can stand on the same footing again. And so the man agrees and does so, But instead of sleeping with these women, he doesn't sleep with anyone and goes back to her. She welcomes him openly, but finds it a bit difficult because he has also slept around. Then he says he didn't sleep with anyone, he loves her, and her only. She strokes his chin and cheek, and says she's sorry for hurting him so much by being with his best friend. And she will never do it again. But he can't trust her anymore, still, and he just can't ride over that wave to be with her.”</p>
<p>“That's it” Mr. Purple said, as nonchalantly as when she started the story.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger, who had something to say about everything, and had a degree in everything, said, “That story is kind of not original, I mean it's nice, and it sounds like him, which means it's kind of original. But I don't like it. He should have ended it like this.” And by this he meant 'insert your own text here because I'm not sure what' kind of thing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry arrived in a storm, no one knew how they knew, but they just knew when he was coming. He walked in and started talking about the prize. Regardless of what the group had just been talking about.</p>
<p>“The GM's wife” he said, “She used to be my girlfriend”</p>
<p>“So we're all involved in this because she was your girlfriend? Is this super risky heist your idea of a date or something?”  Mr. Chatterbox said. She was imagining a date like this.</p>
<p>“Actually, you women should try and imagien the scenario, what if you were locked away for such a long time, and a man came to 'save' you, how would you feel? If you can imagine it, then we will be able to predict her actions. Because we will see three or four steps ahead of what is happening.”</p>
<p>“No” he said, “But I want to tell you a bit about her, just a few relevant things so we can get the ball rolling and what we're dealing with here. Okay, so she used to be really talkative, but she was also very calm and considerate, she would walk at about 3.6 kilometers per hour, which, if you see her legs, is very slow. And her hair was blonde with a tint of brown. Like a landscape painting. She always touched it and smiled, like she was showing it off. I want you to see someone like this, and then when you actually see her, you will be able to recognize her.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy was imaigning this, like everyone else in the room, and instead of a strange woman, he saw Charlotte, the more Mr. Angry said, the more he saw Charlotte in his mind as this woman. And he began to miss her. Was Charlotte this special woman?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean she used to be, what's the point in us knowing what she used to be like? That doesn't help us now risking a life limb”</p>
<p>“Because she hasn't been seen now or anytime recently, she's been locked away” Mr. Angry said. She used to be this person who was skinny and kind and talkative, now she might have pimples everywhere and a double chin, and a mohawk, and one eye like a cyclops...”</p>
<p>“Umm...maybe you're taking it too far? Besides, would you still be able to love her if that happened?”</p>
<p>“This isn't about my love, if such a feeling even exists” Mr. Angry said, “This is a heist, so shut the fuck up and listen. Some people are easy to talk to, talk with everyone and are the center of attention, say the funniest jokes and make everyone laugh. They respect everyone in the group and listen to everyone, that's why. But as soon as you take them out of it, they are with other people, or dating you, then she can't speak, or becomes quiet, she just has nothing to say. Her skin is over there, with her popular friend. Then some other quiet people suddenly become talkative etc. Depending on who they are with. She tries to be popular, to show that she doesn't need him, but then he really doesn't notice her, and she finds herself wandering back to him and saying sorry for the latest thing and asking if he wants to hang out. Then I said sure, and they hang out and repeat everything and she wishes for more contact from me all the time.”</p>
<p>Now Mr. Angry was inadvertently sharing his love story. At the time she was a normal woman with no specialness, but now she was a legend in the minds of very many a man. This transition he had not seen, but he was reliving this memory of her and trying to find her again. From when she was just a nromal smiling kind plain girl, to when she became perfect. And after she became perfect and attained perfection, she became inaccessible to the masses of dangling penises chasing after her. Maybe if he could find her, then something in his life would change for the better. And because he also didn't know what, he had to do this to find out. And for something so unknown and so captivating, there was no risk that would stop him and make him question it.(This paragraph can be updated in more DETAIL!!!)</p>
<p>Each member rememebred what he was saying, and they formed a picture of this woman in their minds.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry delved into the next topic on his list. “Mr. Danger” he said, “I have a favour to ask you, it's not written on the blueprints, but you need to do this”</p>
<p>It wasn't a question, and it wasn't finished, but Mr. Danger nodded. Mr. Melancholy saw it and realized that actually Mr. Danger also had a deep appreciation of Mr. Angry, and admired him. For different reasons, but the resulting admiration was the same. There were so many factors that could be taken in all sorts of different ways for everyone, he could see A, and feel sad, and he could see A and feel embarrassed, or he could see A and be excited and passionate, and it just hapepned that in this case Mr. Melancholy and Mr. Danger's admiration coincided into one place.</p>
<p>“You're going to marry a woman” Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>Mr Danger nodded. Everyone else was like....WTF?? How does that even work? </p>
<p>“I found a woman, and I've buttered her up to you, so she'll say yes, I need you to propose by today or tomorrow at the latest, the wedding should be held on the day of the heist.”</p>
<p>“No worries” Mr. Danger said.</p>
<p>“But Mr. Danger” Mr. Chatterbox said, “You have a girlfriend, remember?”</p>
<p>“Nah, he made her up” Mr. Lazy said. </p>
<p>“This is work, work and personal life are seaparate” Mr. Danger said. And Mr. Angry nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>“But when did marriage become work?”</p>
<p>“Since I said so” Mr. Angry said. Mr. Danger nodded in approvement</p>
<p>Mr. Danger made the same promise that Mr. Angry made, except that their life conditions were completely different. “Just marry this woman quickly for the heist, you'll be married for a week and a half maxmimum, more likely just two or three days. Then we won't have to give her any money.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute” Mr. Chatterbox said, “This woman is in on it as well right?”</p>
<p>“Nah” Mr. Angry said, “Does that matter?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter? She's getting married to a plot, she's being thrown around like a rag in a washing machine and you ask if it matters?”</p>
<p>“It's not a big deal” Mr. Danger said. It was a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox wanted to cry, for this woman, and for the lack of morals staring at her. These guys genuinely didn't care anything about others, and she felt trapped in a world she hated, she wanted to disappear, far far away from these horrible people, but she couldn't, because she had committed herself to staying here.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry explained his intentions, it didn't make it any better. “I organized it so that she's heard about it already. Her name is Angela, and she was originally going to be married to me for a short time, so that Mr. Chatterbox has space to herself. But maybe it would be better if she married Mr. Danger.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox only felt worse now, her friend Angela was going to be used in this ploy, it meant that she really was going to be feeling horrible. If she was a good friend, would she stand up to this? Annalise felt horrible for being a part of this, what if Angela found out. </p>
<p>Although Mr. Chatterbox woudln't pull out of the heist, she knew that if Angela were placed in the same situation, she would pull out.  “You're allowed to pull out whenever you want. You can leave it if you don't think it's right”</p>
<p>When Daniel and Angela hung out next time, she was starting to develop feelings for him. Up to this point it had just been a bit of sharing of self, but now little pieces of stickiness were becoming attached to these pieces she was sharing, and she was becoming attached to him. In a scary way. He was just so different to everyone else she knew, and she was amazed by it.</p>
<p>She asked Daniel about his ex girlfriend. It was a big mistake. The person Daniel described was the most marvellous woman she had ever heard. She wondered if Daniel saw her in the same way. She wasn't one to be insecure, but with enough persuasion it wasn't difficult. She heard about Helen and became insecure, “Am I as pretty as her?? Do you think about her all the time, even while you're with me?” She is insecure while they are together, because he is always looking around at all of the women, and he is seeing how people are talking and doing things. But she is even more insecure by herself.</p>
<p>Angela was an important and complex person, but in the presence of this woman, she felt like she was degraded into a shadow and made irrelevant. Nothing she said seemed to make any difference, she was still the same person,nothign she did would tear her out of the ordinary and place her in front of him as some special She likes Daniel, so much, can't stop thinking about him and wishes that he will come and visit her again while she was here in this bar. And she would pretend as if nothing was happening. She was addicted.</p>
<p>But he didn't come. When he finally did, it made her feel weird because she sensed that he wasn't here for her. He looked preoccupied, with his hands in his pockets and deep in thought. There were people all around him but he didn't notice them, he saw something in Angela, but she wasn't sure what it was. And if she didn't know that, she couldn't feel safe with him. He was here for something greater that would change his world, and hers as well, of that she was sure. Then, right then at 3:03:32 am, she suddenly felt an intense fear. It was a fear that everything she felt and wanted to do wasn't enough, it would never be enough, and it just didn't compare to what he wanted. And she just didn't know what he wanted.</p>
<p>She felt so ashamed, he didn't care that she had never had a boyfriend and never done anything, he just wanted sex right? He didn't actually care about her. She got the feeling. SO was he leading her on without thinking of her? Was he just playing around? Or did he just want to be friends?</p>
<p>But when she pulled up the courage to ask him directly, because she had to, she just absolutely had to. Then he was silent, and she dreaded the worst.</p>
<p>Then he said something.</p>
<p>Angela was slamming herself against the tiled bathroom wall like a wave. She beat her body like a pulp and came out bruised and like a pumpkin. She was crying so hard, her world was in a flood, and we could only guess what she had heard. But it was obvious, it had torn her apart, and she couldn't function properly anymore.</p>
<p>“She's a whole different category, she's meant to be dreamed about” he says. “Not touched. Like window shopping. She's different to you”</p>
<p>Daniel was being honest, suddenly, conveniently, he was the most honest man.</p>
<p>And although she knew that he would answer this question in this way, in the slightly disregarding way that he always did, while she was with him or with anyone else she only shrugged it off nonchalantly, it was normal (whatever that meant), depending on how you looked at it. But in the presence of herslef and only herself, she found herself crying when she was alone, and he had gone, and all her friends were asleep already. She found herself crying in bed and wiping her tears on the pillow. She had only asked him because it would be bugging her for weeks if she didn't. And he wasn't asking her anything.</p>
<p>After exhausting crying, she sat on the edge of the bed, the corner, her butt halfway over, she tried to figure out who this amazing woman was that Daniel spoke of. She overheard a rumour somewhere a month ago that Daniel liked the prettiest woman, but sees it's not true, then overheard him say he liked another woman, then she saw her and didn't believe it. One time while she was sweeping across the grounds, the hotel managers had an evening party set up, and she had organized some things outside, doing the administrative duties of the party. Then, when the party ahd already started and everyone was talking and bonding with each other, one of the elevators opened promiscuously, a woman with a long gown and long hair came out. Angela didn't know how she knew, but she knew that this was the woman Daniel was in love with. Not her. Behind this woman, holding her waist gently, was the GM, a loud man with a small waist and a big head. He had a proper suit on, with a tuxedo trailing behind. This woman, she had a look of clumsiness and cluelessness. She was being presented as a prize, as a symbol of trustworthiness. Like the GM was showing his important guests around his trophy room, and they would admire his trophies one by one, speculate on the history behind them and where they were going.</p>
<p>She decided to ask Daniel, because she had a strong feeling that this was the woman. Daniel looked at her for a while, a look of distrust and prediction. He decided to tell her who it was, probably just to satisfy her curiosity. “You should be more like her” he says, and she gets upset with him, but can't help looking. “I'm going to save her” he said.</p>
<p>Later Angela met this amazing woman that Daniel described. She went to the GM's room to deliver something to him personally, she was dressed up and had the code to the golden floor. The elevator opened and vases and vases of fresh flowers were piled up beside the walkway, each had been recently watered and had a different decoration on it. The aisle smelled of rainforest and chocolate icecream. As she walked along she admired the golden rails, the diamond studded walls. Then she knocked on the room, there were two doors on this floor. One was the room of the GM, hid in a small corner there, and the other was the room of the GM's mother. Apparently she hadentered the room fifty years ago and never left since. No one knew anythign about her, just what they remembered from when she first moved here. Her door had a quiet signplate that read </p>
<pre><code>            The Mother Unit
</code></pre>
<p>Standing next to the door she heard rustling inside, like a TV was being played, and glass was breaking, gunshots and an action scene. Then she went past the door and to the GM's door. Here she knocked, and almost immediately a woman opened the door. The woman from the other day. </p>
<p>Angela knew that this woman was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world. But she was shocked, because up close this woman was so plain, so normal, and just another woman that Angela would walk past on the street. She wasn't slim and happy all the time, she wasn't even funny or popular, she was actually pretty boring and normal, vain and shallow and cared about her looks a lot. Was this what men deemed important? As she walked back, and the door to the room closed behind her, she felt dejected. Even the man she really respected, Daniel, was this the kind of woman he was looking for? If she became any dumber she would be toilet paper. Were all men led by their dicks? Inside their brain was a large sized dick. Angela felt insulted, her own intelligence and ambition, her hard work studying to better herself, and her moral code of conduct, her whole life's efforts were beginning to feel like nothing.</p>
<p>Then she started to feel insecure, again. Maybe there was something in her that Daniel saw that she herself didn't and maybe that was why Daniel would never like her, no matter what she did. But he would like this woman easily. Then she wondered if this woman knew that Daniel had done all of this for her, like it means nothing to herself at all. If she knew his intentions.</p>
<p>Jason, walking through the same party, he was a waiter serving drinks, he alsocuaght a glimpse of the GM's fiance, and he swore that the woman talking at reception was her. </p>
<p>Angela didn't want to see her anymore. What if there was something about this woman that no other woman could compare with. What if there was an inherent quality about her that was unique to her and no other woman possessed it? If Angela saw that she would be devastated. She rememebered walking a long time ago one day when it was kind of raining, and cloudy above, she had an umbrella out and was walking to a class somewhere. She even forgot what city she was in, but she remembered hearing footsteps and then looking up, just out the bottom of the umbrella, to catch a beautiful figure walking past. It was only an instant, but she knew in that moment, the neurons fired in her and told her that this woman was perfect. </p>
<p>And she never saw anything like that again.</p>
<p>When she explained it to her friend Misty, Misty laughed “I knew it, there's no way such a beautiful woman could exist, it's just impossible in the laws of nature” she said. “She looks like every other woman, she's not even a ten, she's a five or six at best. It's just that this guy you're idolizing is making up an excuse to get you off his back, and that's the best specimen of woman he could find.”</p>
<p>Misty thought about it and laughed, “So she's not even pretty? That's a wow”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the way he explained it, it was like 'Helen is a whole different category, above ten', but when I actually see her she doesn't even place, “I don't know what all these people are saying”</p>
<p>“Have you talked to her though? Maybe there's something special about her talking? I mean...”</p>
<p>“She doesn't speak, she's mute, and she's deaf, she can only see you, I think that's why all these powerful men fall for her”</p>
<p>Misty was surprised, “Are you sure she doesn't...speak? I mean who doesn't speak these days? Even  if you've been living in a cave all your life you can still speak?”</p>
<p>“Maybe she's a doppleganger, a replacement person to protect the real one” Angela said. And they laughed, their imaginations were coming through again. Misty dipped underneath the covers and started imagining all of this, she had never been in a relationship, but she had heard so much about them that she wished she could know more.</p>
<p>“Maybe they're going to steal things” Misty said, under the covers her voice was muffled but everyone was used to it. And everyone was Angela.</p>
<p>“Who knows, I think this whole things fucked up, we're in a doomed mission stealing some abstract fantasy for our boss, who's just some pimp on a revenge mission.” Said Angela, in a criminal voice.</p>
<p>Both were laughing.</p>
<p>When Angela was walking past the side door to the staff area she overheard Daniel talking to a woman. He was talking into the elevator comm. In the comm was a woman, the innocent woman. They were talking about complex things, and she realized this must be her.</p>
<p>Down on the other side of the party, a couple were sitting on a sofa, slouched backwards like they were very comfortable in each other's company.</p>
<p>She had had so many boyfriends, had had so much sex, yet said that each guy wasn't a replacement on a conveyor belt of 'products', because she was crying so much over the latest guy. She had never even for one second thought that, it was all men thinking so and accusing her.</p>
<p>Then he said he felt like a replacement. He learnt that she had opened her legs to many men, and he informed her of his decision to stay pure. He said that she was living her life casually without any real thoughts, without planning. And he just happened to be there, and through a series of accidents they met, so she grabbed onto him, and now they were having this conversation.</p>
<p>“You're only concerned with commitment, how the relationship is going, and not with how I actually am as a person. You're just raising me to be relationship material that's it.” He said “It's always 'what does this bring for our future? Is this going to be a lasting thing or is it just some short lived fun' </p>
<p>Angela walked past this conversation, just glad that it wasn't her having to hear those things from a guy.</p>
<p>Daniel and William had many conversations about the integrity of Mr. Danger as a member of the team. It was already too late to change, but William kept insisting. </p>
<p>“There's no one more experienced than Mr. Danger.”</p>
<p>“That's because his experience is killing his own team to survive, please reconsider.”</p>
<p>Finally, after many talks deep into the night, and out of nowhere, while they were making tea in the common area, Mr. Angry admitted it, and he admitted it as Daniel, not holding himself behind any other title. And he said that “It was a huge mistake to hire someone so violent and so antisocial and so disruptive, and even though he is excellent for the job, even me, if I had another opportunity to re-hire, would not go near him.”</p>
<p>Daniel had just admitted the truth, how he felt about everything. It was a rare moment of honesty from him. William saw it, but when he blinked the moment was gone and Daniel had gone back to talking about the plan, as if he had never said anything just now.</p>
<p>And so William continued working for him.</p>
<p>But after they finished that tea, and discussses the job, and then started making the next tea, Daniel swapped back to it again. His mind was as agile as a monkey in heat.</p>
<p>“I knew I needed a proper team. I knew it would be difficult hiring people for the job, I had to check their moral integrity, their loyalty had to be high, and so were a bunch of other factors. So I asked all the members a specific question to see it. The question, I think you remember it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought so” William said.</p>
<p>“Well, that was my main criteria for judgment, as if you can judge someone's personality, such a complex and intangible thing so straightforwardly with a single question, it's a dream. But Mr. Danger answered it normally, there were no skewed remarks or hidden agendas. That made me realize Mr. Danger was normal in real life, you would never suspect such violent and self destructive explosive behaviour from him. Besides, I even asked him, and Mr. Danger said it honestly from himself what he did. He gave this vulnerability and honesty, to show that he was investing himself in this job. And I trust him. In the worst case scenario we will have to kill people. We have to be prepared for it. Carry weapons and guns to deal with it. And he's an excellent candidate, if only for that”</p>
<p>“Well Mr. Danger's prepared, of course” William said.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Danger looked at him, they were in the meeting. They both knew that each other knew. Mr. Danger stared at him for a long time, all of the jokes and friendly habits they had were disappearing fast and gone. Mr. Danger looked at Daniel, he knew he told him but that was okay, and he looked at William. Then he looked back. William never knows what he is thinking, but this right now might be the closest he comes to seeing it.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry said, “You all have to be prepared to throw away everything that isn't necessary. Not saying you will have to, but the risk is present, and no one knows how something like this will turn out. So it's safer if you lower your expectations and keep your focus on the heist and attaining the treasure. We are all now grinding against the fabric of reality, like salmon swimming upstream, because we're going agaisnt everything we've known, the things we should be doing, and things we shouldn't be doing.</p>
<p>But still. Mr. Angry himself was holding onto things, while making everyone else throw everything away. And William and Jason, and Angela knew it. He was holding onto it so hard that he was getting everyone involved in this for this one thing he was holding on to.</p>
<p>When Daniel spoke, it was his most recent sentence that was the most interesting, when he wrote, it was the most immediate thing that was strongest. Then after it passed it started to all sink away into nothing, everything did. “So maybe you should say something and if you feel it, then never say anything again.” Daniel said this with a serious expression, and of course what he meant by it, was that he was the teacher, the boss here.</p>
<p>Mr.Melancholy had some remarks to put Mr. Angry down in front fo everyone. Like why they were doing this, if it was all for his love, that was mixing the personal and work like a milkshake. When he saw how happy everyone was and chilling, he just went back somewhere else. They hadn't yet learned about their boss's motivations. They were still looking hopeful, and Mr. Melancholy chose to hide it all to himself, it was better if they didn't know, and he would carry this burden by himself.</p>
<p>Here were thieves with a lot of integrity and respect for each other.</p>
<p>JASON</p>
<p>Jason and his wife Laura were always arguing about the same thing. He said, “I love you, you mean everything to me, but, if you cheat, if you leave, then I don't know you, you mean nothing to me.” </p>
<p>She had already cheated but she pretended that she hadn't, like she was the innocent pure thing he thought he knew. “Of course” she said. And she was furious inside, because she knew he was cheating all the time on her, with every second woman who had a waist slimmer than her hips. But she's not allowed to admit this to him as he degrades her in front of everyone. It is so tiring being the 'good' person.</p>
<p>Then Laura cheated on Jason again but didn't tell him. And they were together all the time like nothing had changed, like everything was normal and alright. Everyone saw them and said that they were perfect for each other, the best relationship material. She started believing it herself as well, but then one day a loose string that she placed was left there and it unwound in front of his eyes. He found out. And then he looked at her differently, she was watching as he stared at her, his eyes changed, from then on he ignored her, she was nothing, he treated everyone else the same way was kind and respectful like the great person he was, but to her he just ignored, like she wasn't even there. Like there was some space there he couldn't understand and recognize. He didn't even cry for her.</p>
<p>Then she vowed to not cry for him, not even cry for her, this relationship would be forgotten without a tear shed. She would try to forget about him and store him away like all of the other guys in relationships that she has met. She would craft something more important that couldn't be forgotten.</p>
<p>During the day she shrugged it off with work. At night her loneliness took bites at her like a lake of piranhas and she felt bad, her pillow became wet and she kept moving and re-cleansing her sheets. Then a different guy came up to her in the store, staring at her, he was always interested, and was really kind to her. She started to notice him for the first time, she smiled and waved to him. She couldn't remember the last time she smiled at someone. </p>
<p>Then she remembered. And she was able to restart.</p>
<p>Then Jason felt like he was just a replacement for another guy who was walking into her life, and giving her the things she needed. Suddenly he became interested in her again, only when he saw that she was really popular with everyone else. When she moved away she felt so guilty, of leaving him. But she realized thay actually he was the one with 'replacement' fear issues. She was his replacement, and if one was a replacement, then it went both ways. The spare part was always going to feel foreign to the car, nothing was more lonely than the spare tire.</p>
<p>She introduced herself to him, and remembered how it felt, the thrill of meeting someone new, the unsettling worries of what they thought, and how things were going. She told everyone that she was different now. But whenever he was nearby she became quiet and reserved and unable to act freely because she was still a bit nervous. But now even long after breaking up with him, she still felt that way, like the tips of her hands and toes were still numb from it and hadn't recovered yet. As if it was a frostbite that had bitten into her and caused permanent damage.</p>
<p>Jason was really attached to Laura, he was afraid of how attached he was becoming. He couldn't give her up for the heist if things came to it, he couldn't leave her. And he couldn't do his own things either. Yet he had committed himself to both, it was going to be a sour ending, like being pulled by two heaving horses running full pace. Especially because deep in his manly heart he knew which one he was going to leave behind. He knew if he told Laura she would join him, but now he didn't know if he wanted to do that.</p>
<p>Big Chapter or all sorts of things. Many different perspectives, Camera flow as opposed to character following camera. Camera looks for action</p>
<p>The elevator in the hotel moved up, the door opened and each floor was a different place. The carpet was a different colour, there were stains in different places, and the same aimless lost faces wandered back and forth along the hallways. There was a wedding on the fifth floor and people everywhere were in their own elevators.</p>
<p>On the ground floor, a girl sat with her family at the dining table, they argued or talked about boring things. She stood up and walked away from the table, she opened a door, and she was in her room, staring at a picture of her with her best friends when they went swimming three and a half years ago. She remembered wearing that embarrassing bikini for her crush. She walked away from the picture and opened the bathroom door. She was playing music on the other side, a deep brown cello with a sound that resonated with the celestial bodies. She finally stood up and went through the next door, opposite where she came in. On the otherside were people waiting. There were about ten of them, some sitting, some standing and tapping their thumbs, they were always waiting for her, and she smiled and told them everything was fine in a quiet voice. Then they all stood up and clapped and were in an uproar for her.</p>
<p>One of the employees sat at a table in the staff lounge. The table was too low for him, he was crouched down over his tiny computer screen clicking away ferociously. Unbeknowest to him, time flew by the computer screen, days and nights passed, and over time the seasons. He sat there in front of the screen and stood up later when it was summer. He was always busy with either work, or computer, this lifestyle was all he had. So that when anyone needed to talk to him for some issues urgently, they could just check if he was at work, if he wasn't then statistically he would be in the staff lounge. For him personally, the lifestyle was beginning to become pointless, but the computer was all he knew, so he stayed at it.</p>
<p>A man from the store made a friend in the nearby lodge. He went and knocked on the door, then caleld his friend up. His friend said he would be down in a second, so the man looked back out at the mountains. In an instant they were majestic, always there, always covered in snow, and always inacessible. Even to the highest climber. His friend came down and they talked for a bit about this and that, and then moments later he was in his friend's room and talking.  After talking for about ten minutes excitedly, he left and went back home. His home was two buildings away, and he walked under the bare stars that always whispered something. The wind soared down from the mountains. When he walked into his room, it took him a while to adjust to the change. Everything was normal again, the adventure was over. No one was watching him right now, it wasn't too late for anything, everything was normal right now.</p>
<p>There was a 41 year old man who managed a large party of women. He was actually part of the tourist group, but he only hired Japanese women. He didn't announce it, but his latest target was 20 and counting, and she wanted to go trekking with him. When they went hiking she was getting cheeky, things like poking him, and very mild sexual connotations. She was really shy. But she also accepted his advances, and laughed. At his work it was full of these young women.</p>
<p>It was so taboo, but that was also what made it more interesting. And then it actually happened? She was perverted as well, but didn't show it to anyone. It was like a Kea's wings, only orange when it is at it's most naked flight and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Away from the manager, scrolling down the stairs, were two men engaged in a conversation. They ddin't talk much, but from the way they were comfortable you could see that they spent a lot fo time with each toher.</p>
<p>Paul said what James said, something about it being great talking to Paul, everytime. It was a reccuring pattern in the complex mesh of human life and its interactions within an environment. This time they discusses cheating. He was afraid that she would cheat, is it him that is bad, or is it her?</p>
<p>“It's not just one that is bad, but the ambiguity is something we should adopt and accept into our lives, all of existence is one, all of life is one.” James said. “And then you will be at peace.”</p>
<p>“Then it shouldn't matter right? whether this or that happens” Paul said, “If it's all going to end up in the same place”</p>
<p>James answered immediately, he had thought of it beforehand, “But it matters how much time you spend alone, Ego is a personal thing that festers when you're alone and doing things by yourself. And it changes the colour of the things you see around you”</p>
<p>Then Paul became quiet in front of his friend, it was a display of intimate trust, something very rarely experienced between two males of this calibre. The fact that he was doing it here was prrof of very rare behaviour, and we were lucky to witness it. We may be one of the few people to ever witness something like this, but the first to capture it in text. Paul spoke with his bac to his friend. That made it bearable. “I'm always worried about the same thing, in general just always worried. It's a big part of my personality, like some people are always angry, and when they're happy it's because someone said something different. It's not because they're actually happy. But I'm always worried, I'm in that state right before taking a dump an uneasy and in need of privacy.”</p>
<p>Paul said this, and it showed that he was more than just another person here. But it also showed that he was just another person.</p>
<p>Beside these men was one man standing and looking outside the window. He gazed over the hotel roofs of the lower floors and at the mountain. Today was rainy and tourists were unhappy, but he stood there for so long that it started to become serene. The raindrops hit the window and made slash marks that grew and grew and disappeared. Life became less dense and more sparsely spread out. He had a social anxiety that, as the malaise usually goes, was hard to pinpoint. He wanted to talk to people, but he feared that the conversation with strangers wouldn't go well and it would be boring. And if he talked to a woman, she would be bored of him.</p>
<p>Two floors beneath this window was an office window. Inside were two screens around a computer, the chair was empty and swung backwards, like someone had left it in a hurry. There were documents piled up beside a computer, and security camera images scanning across the monitors.</p>
<p>The GM was never in his office, but he had hired others just to look at the security cameras, a few guards were walking around and making sure everyone was doing their job. They looked up at the employee, checked his ID against a primary key, then made sure he was doing what the job requirements were. They had a list of each employees job requirements. Usually someone was always sitting in that seat looking at the cameras. But recently the crime rate was low, and nothing much was happening.</p>
<p>Some people dressed in cow onesies walked past with a boom box blazing, they looked really cool, or they thought they did. They came out of nowhere, and disappeared as fast as they came. And no one knew if it had actually happened, it was bizarre.</p>
<p>A tourist visited the shop, when he got there everyone spoke to him in a language which he didn't speak. But he looked like he came from the vicinity of. And he felt offended to be classified as one fo them, because he was supposed to be an outsider. Some of them said his language was good, some said his language was bad, some said both were bad. But everyone said different things, and he just smiled and nodded and laughed with them each time.</p>
<p>One of the new employees who had just staretd as a housekeeper bought something from the shop for the first time. Then she wandered back home and was surprised by how close everything was. She thought it would be further, but it was right there and people from everywhere keep wandering through. This simple concept baffled her, and she sat down right there on the grass, cross legged, with her bag flung to the side, just to understand this pointless concept. This chapter in the lecture of life.</p>
<p>In the store the tourists had just left on the 'excavation', and the employees had to radio in the time of the boats. This was a safety measure, but they also knew that for certain, one day, an accident would happen, and no one knew when, or how serve it would be, but the results were certain. It was a prediction that something was bound to happen. So they radioed in the numbers each and every day, double and triple checking them to see everything was correct, they couldn't take any mistakes.  It was one of those rare occasions where people knew that something was coming, and they were exerting all efforts to mitigate results.</p>
<p>The statue of the big figure in front of the store had now stood there for seventy five years. He had done a big deed and now the world remembered him for it. The hotel was a standing remnant of his glory, and he was eternally standing in watch of the mountain that he had climbed. He welcomed the bus that arrived on this day, the guests all got off and took pictures of the statue, as they did every day. But they all felt unique about it, like it was a first time. </p>
<p>Because ego was unique and alone.</p>
<p>A young man met a girl his age, and they began chatting. Although there were no labels and signposts, she thought he was hitting on her. He didn't think so, he thought they were just talking as friends. But the conversation carried on with no difference. He felt like he could talk to her about all sorts of things, talk about something mundane, like his life at home with his sister, and he was able to talk to her about it, and she really enjoyed it. But she didn't show it much, so he wasn't too sure. She was really excited about the relationship and where it was headed. One afternoon they met by 'conincidence' and sat and ate rice crackers all day while looking up at the mountain. It looked hungry and delicious. They broke the rice cracker with their teeth and swallowed. After so many swallowed, and the packet becoming empty, they started to feel dizzy. It was a strange feeling brought on by the preservatives, it was like a chemical factory in their stomachs. But the front end was a weird feeling, not a bad one. Till the end he would just think they were friends and never question it further. Till the end she would think he was disinterested, and eventually after two months would feel like nothing was happening and move on to the next person.</p>
<p>A woman who lived a few buildings over sat in the staff lounge with a computer. But she got bored after an hour and lay back. Wishing she had friends to talk to, people to share her life with. She didn't know it yet, but she was desperate for a boyfriend, she thoguht about going to parties, stretching herself thin in order to meet someone special. But her last boyfriend was scared off by her after she wasn't happy, then she lied that he had raped her, then she demanded compensation for it from the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>(The main characters are just more names in this, nothing glorious, nothing not normal, nothing you can possibly do will break you out of the box of being 'special')
On the weekend, Daniel and William 'ran into' each other. Daniel said he felt like William always wanted to talk to him, so now he was giving him the chance. He felt this way because William was always hanging around aimlessly. But Daniel wasn't supposed to be so nice, wasn't he always busy and complaining? William felt a little weirded out by this sudden change of character. But he took it as Daniel being nice for one fo the last times they would meet. And he took it with a grain of sadness. Whatever grains of that were...</p>
<p>Sometimes he just didn't want to talk to anyone but right now was the perfect chance. But right now William didn't feel like talking, and the talking didn't happen, yet again. Daniel walked away after he saw nothing was happening. We don't know what he thought, and how much of it was disguised, but one could guess that he wasn't pleased.</p>
<p>Daniel went all the way to the nearest town, it was the gateway to the hotel, and a one way street out. It was a test run to see how long it took to go that far. Daniel blasted music to the sun and his hair was electrified and static in the wind. He calculated how mjuch fuel was used, and how much weight was gained. Any alternative escape routes. But when anyone asked him, he calmed his busy mind and told them that he had only come all this way to buy ice cream.</p>
<p>“Why don't you tell them the truth? Thee's no reason to lie, in fact, it's better if yout ell them the truth” Jason said, when he saw Daniel getting back from the trip and asked him about it.</p>
<p>“Because they dont' need to know, and if I can tell a lie and not the truth, I will always tell a lie”</p>
<p>Then Jason was scared by Mr. Angry's pathological lying. He started to wonder if Mr. Angry ever told the truth and if this whole thing was made up. What's the point of lying? What does he actually want? What if they started the heist and it was one fo those cheap jokes, and Jason was the only one there, everyone else had pulled out and were looking at him and laughing.</p>
<p>Before long the two guys were joking about sex. And why were they always talking about sex? If it wasn't sex then it was stealing, where did their nobility go? Anyone who tried to be kind to Mr. Angry, he just gave them the middle finger and told them to fuck off, and then piled an insult on top. Mr. Lazy felt like the only reason Mr. Angry recrutied them was because they were all quiet and reliable. Reliable meant that none of them were going to complain, and Mr.Angry wanted an audience to listen to his actions. He was delusional. Mr. Lazy was getting tired of being bossed around and always talking about the same things, he's had enough.</p>
<p>But he stopped being scared and went home to his wife.</p>
<p>He was usually quiet, but when she came back home, he ran to her and called out and was desperate to be with her. He had ploughed and walked through so many strangers and become desperate, when he saw her he grabbed onto her and never let her go.</p>
<p>Randy said such great things about William's girlfriend, how she is so kind and absolutely beautiful.   And he says he adores that mole she has on her left cheek, just underneath the lip, he loved it. If a woman talks about another woman she knows, he knows it means something. But if a man talks about another woman he knows, it means something as well. Everyone knew this. Didn't he learn it? It was the lesson everyone took, did he miss the lesson?</p>
<p>When William saw his girlfriend with him, they were walking pretty far apart, and not talking much, but he saw a distorted view. She was hodling his hand and laughing hard all the time with him, and she looked like she enjoyed it more than anything else. And see her being with him, how could he allow it?</p>
<p>During the planning of the last phase of the heist. William didnt' contribute anything, this was rare because Mr. Angry had opened it for group discussions. But William woke up and realzied he didn't feel like it. He had been excited about it the night before, but now he was bored stiff.</p>
<p>He had been watching pornography all day on a digital device. Before he knew it six horus had passed. The others got upset because he didn't help them plan at all. They had been sitting in a square planning, while he was sitting in his room with the curtains drawn and thrashed the monkey, tamed the beast, whipped the snake, milked the monster, beat the sausage, sold the fish, unleashed the bullets; while looking at indecent things. </p>
<p>“Is that what he was doing all day?” Jason said, “That's kind of a pointless life don't you think?”</p>
<p>“That's why I don't touch it” Gerry said. “I never look at pornography, I don't even blink to it. And I don't touch alochol, not even a drop, I peel off any skin that touches the stuff. Cigarettes are for sinners, and those with a low volition. I'm a good person, I see the best in everyone.”</p>
<p>The others nodded like sheep, “Yeah we all agree, you're a great guy”</p>
<p>It was complicated thought, another guy could be the worst guy, doing all the bad things in the world, 76% to be exact. But he would never steal from anyone, not a cent, not even the crumbs of their food that they dropped on the street. He never laid his hands on someone else's belongings, he protected them and kept them safe from real thieves. This could be possible, it didn't have to exist, but it was possible, and its possibility was a worry.</p>
<p>“But then why is Mr.Angry stealing this huge money?” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“Just once in your life you can do something contrary, and it won't harm anyone if you've done enough good? Being good is boring anyway” Mr. Danger said. And he answered the question of his dodgy history. Just being defined by something once is anomalous data that you are relying on to judge someone. It was like a first impression that meant nothing. “You need time to judge someone properly, there's no point looking at someone and saying you know, because of this or that”</p>
<p>“And do you think about this often Mr. Danger?” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>Back in his room, William was watching pornography because he felt bored with life, and nothing else seemed to make any sense. So, because nothing made sense, it was better to look at a world that made equally little sense. Because he felt left out of the group and didn't fit in, he may as well enjoy himself while he didn't fit in. But he couldn't say this to other men, and the women seemed to judge him.</p>
<p>Instead of things happening, everyone suggested Mr. Chatterbox go over to see what was happening. Because the only way he would come out was like one of the ancient gods. If he were given a sacrifice at the top of the tower at the right hour. So they agreed to try and bring him out by offering him a real girl, they paid Mr. Chatterbox to get with him, and she was convinced by them and became excited by it as well. To be able to change a man was a huge honour for someone like her, whatever she meant by that.</p>
<p>They left him alone, then a month later they came back to learn that she had taken him down the road of hedonistic passion. It was a road that was possible, but not taken by many. They enjoyed everything, instant gratification. And he looked at everything and needed more. He had tattoos, dressed like a woman, danced florally, and had progressed into the world of hedonistic passions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven3-final-part">forty seven.3: Final Part!!</h3>
<p>The 6am alarm sounded like punches in the wall. Each punch blew him back into the world called 'reality', he was being punched through, head first, blood flying everywhere like a flock of seagulls that squawked through the air in a wave. He kept getitng pounded, he felt like the fruit in a fruit salad with people staring down at him. Until he collapsed and woke up horizontally on a bed. </p>
<p>It felt like a nosebleed.</p>
<p>He forgot to write, because life was getting so busy, but now everything was kind of clicking back into place. And he doesn't need to say this, and his partner already knew. He had these characetrs in his head, they were in that world, and he wanted to bring them to this one as well.
“Mr. Angry, Mr. Sad, Mr. Happy, Mr. Smiles”</p>
<p>But it was ironic, what if they already existed, would they be different from the way he imagined them to be? Or would they get along as great friends?</p>
<p>There was a power outage at the lodge where she was residing. Once the lights went out she complained vehemently. Then he was talking to her and they discussed things together. She said she would be excited for it the next day, she looked forward to meeting him and everything was cool and fun and they would enjoy it. </p>
<p>The power outage spread over the land near the hotel. The lights went out fast and slow like a ripple from a wave. If people weren't concerned, then it might have looked beautiful. The mountains saw it happen, and a strong wind blew, blowing the top layer of fresh cotton snow off as an avalanche. It fell 340 meters with a rumble, and any citizens living near the sea would have said that the sound resembled the waves crashing onto a cliff that always brought up spree around them. The avalanche finally stopped at a point in the mountain that sunk down and absorbed the impact. </p>
<p>Lisa was flashing her phone at the moon, then someone answered the phone call, and she felt so romantic about it. But she looked around and didn't see anyone she could tell. There was a man sitting at a bench, but he was so quiet and still, creepy.</p>
<p>The power outage was caused because Daniel was doing something by himself and pulled a plug. We still weren't sure if it was an accident or if it was calculated.But the lights all went out.</p>
<p>Then he closed the power box, came down from the ladder, and walked home. It was a test run. Then he saw the hotel elevator stopped, and he pretends to be maintenance and go and fix it. He knows who is in it, it's her, and when he just thinks of her he becomes nervous and excited and wants to be closer. He walked past the apartment and saw a phone flashing and communicated back to it.</p>
<p>Melanie was bringing candles to all of the houses. As soon as the lights went out she knew that this was a communal need that would need to be satisfied. She took them to the first place, knocked on the door and handed them over. It was a bit scary because she had a candle burning by itself, and they could only see her shadow and her face lit up dimly against the night. But when they saw it was her and what she was doing they were grateful, everyone was grateful, everyone was mid-way through dinner. And they came to the door like they had never done it before. In the dark all of these people were having trouble getting the door.</p>
<p>Melanie first asked them if they had candles already, when they replied no she handed a few out to them. She held them out with outstretched arms. They lit them off of her original one. All copying and using her initial starting point.</p>
<p>Jason heard the knock on the door and went to it. He was smiling and was surprised by how funny he felt. Laura had just said something hilarious and he was still laughing when he saw Melanie at the door. She held out a candle, “Would you like one?” When the candle was lit and placed in the middle of the dining table, he saw a bit of the familiar surroundings.</p>
<p>(just connections between all of them, coincidences happening, etc.)</p>
<p>(HIMYM episode of connection
Marhsall's book, he forgot behind, Ted asks if he has one and he says he forgot it, and Stella acually didn't read it, though he was.
Barney was yelling in the phone) </p>
<p>he does something super romantic for her, 
then lights come on and he realizes it's the wrong girl, it's his best friend's girl? And she has now fallen for him?
Oh whateva, he goes along with it, she's alright anyway.</p>
<p>The next day there was a big cleaning, because it had been planned for the night before, but after the power outage it wasn't possible, so everyone was doing it today while the sun was up.</p>
<p>Their boss, Mr. Angry, came into the store. William saw him walk past and waved, but Daniel didn't respond. William dismissed it as just that he hadn't been seen. Daniel was wearign janitor's clothing and a spiteful protest on his lips. He was carrying a vacuum cleaner with an extension cord wrapepd around his waist like a belt. </p>
<p>In that moment while watching Daniel walk past, William felt a great sorrow. It was only an instant long, but it was enough to shake the way he was standing, he felt a bit different about everything now, and it wasn't enough to visibly shake him, or affect his life. But it was a miniscule change that would do something.
William's sadness derived from seeing the man he respected, and the man he dedicated so much of his life to with the heist, Mr. Angry, walking past looking so feeble and weak. He was a slave to the authorities and the system around him, he couldn't escape from it. His intelligence and passions and dreams and virtues were squandered under the impulses of the collective.</p>
<p>The sadness he felt was a disappointment at the injustice he saw this man facing. But also at the futility of trying. Even a man of Daniel's calibre was wrought powerless. Daniel made his way to the theatre at the back, he had a list of places he had to clean dangling out of his pocket. He proceeded to vacuum the chairs in the big theatre, every single chair had to be vacuumed properly.</p>
<p>he respects so much with the plan and everything, then run into him during the day cleaning the chairs in the big theatre, later he tried to pretend that he didn't see Daniel. Because he knew that even Daniel who was his best friend, if he saw him here, it would be awkward, because William was in so much a higher position than him. But yet William respects him more. Their friendship was made on something kind of like respect, probably.</p>
<p>To this end William wasn't sure if it was just him seeing this and feeling this way, or if it was actually Daniel who was creating this effect. This would always be unclear, and at the time it was unclear to him as well. By living passively he aimed to try and live as retrospectively and wisely as he could.</p>
<p>William didn't see her because he was so focused on Daniel, but a girl was walking behind Daniel wearing the same janitor's uniform, if the housekeeping uniform was bleak, this was so bleak that it was dismissed as wallpaper. When they were in private, the girl held up her mop, to soak up whatever shit was lying around. She went up to him and holding onto his shirt so he would turn back. When he turned back she started swearing that he didn't respect their jobs, he was putting them both at risk. </p>
<p>Daniel was frustrated and swore back at her.He told her that if it worked out then she would be the first one to use all of the money anyway, so what was she saying? She wasn't even putting herself at risk. She would get an easy reward, unlike the other team members who were giving forth a leg and limb. If they came out missing a limb, it wouldn't be unexpected, and they have mentally prepared themselves for it. In a way, it was the ultimate detachment, and nothing compared to how detached they had to be, and prepared to lose everything in order to achieve this heist.</p>
<p>When he said this, the girl, who was Charlotte, who was doing Housekeeping as a volunteer for a day and regretting it, she felt like Daniel had never loved. No matter how much love anyone dispensed towards him, he would reject it as meaningless. And he was incapable of expressing anything meaningful with it. So she realized this and stopped in her words, she wasn't going to bother with it.</p>
<p>After work Daniel changed out of his janitor's uniform, out of his housekeeping uniform, like he was shedding layers of skin, into something more appropriate. Then he went home and showered, then came out and sat at the staff lounge. All day he had spoken very few words, his mind was full of strategy and revenge, and predictions for things that might happen. There was no compartment in him for love.</p>
<p>Then Angela saw Daniel in the staff lounge. She was overjoyed to see him, but she calmed herself and didn't show it. She went up to him without a change of expression and asked him if he was doing all of this because of love.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” He wasn't faking anything, his annoyance was real. She was frankly a bit scared by it, and a little disappointed that he was like this as well. “I have heard that you have a woman someplace else that you're engaged to.”</p>
<p>“Yes” he said, knowing the foreseen consequences.</p>
<p>“And what about me?” Angela said it like she was answering questions in an exam. This particular question was worth a lot of marks.</p>
<p>“You're here” he said. Like she didn't matter, like everything was here, or there, or everywhere.</p>
<p>“Is this all for that girl? of the love for a woman who's someplace else?” Angela wanted to get things straight, first, she had to understand which girl, then she could start to begin to understand just what was going on. But this wasn't helpful, he was in love with such a strong idea that she didn't know how she should begin debunking it.</p>
<p>And he nodded and said yes, that's why. His answer was vague, and it was unclear just what, but his tone to her told her that he wasn't interested anymore. Whatever window had been open was now closed, she was staring at the frame, and the painted gutters of it where the paint had been peeling off for years but no one noticed.</p>
<p>Daniel was thinking about the heist again. When he wasn't talking, his mind wandered in that direction. The previous boss who wasn't promoted was actually the mastermind behind everything, providing them with everything, they wanted to make sure he's not giving it to them just so they could test the system. Getting architecture plans, but in the end they rejected it and did it all themselves. Daniel met this man and didn't like him. After talking to him for an hour he liked him even less. But he didn't show it. </p>
<p>“What do you want in life?” Angela said. She switched the topic like it was the other side of a knife, and she kept changing her approach so that no one would see her. “You're always full of this grand ideas, it's really confusing for me, I don't know what you're doing”</p>
<p>“One of my ambitions” Daniel said,  “Is that I want to rival the most successful entrepreneurs in the world”</p>
<p>“Isn't that kind of foolish?” she said. She wanted to show him how she was right. That she could guide him the right way. Like so many others who had met Daniel before her, she was trying to do the same thing. She fell into the same trap of caring for a man who didn't care about her. Daniel saw it instantly, and when he saw it he switched off. “Just one word, 'Foolish'  You're already rich and have achieved a lot, so why want more? Why do you work hard? What's the point if you always want more?”</p>
<p>Daniel thought about what response he should give, he could be quiet and calm, or he could be shocked and taken back by how true what she was saying was. Or else he could get upset at her for judging him and not understanding. Or else he could say he liked her, how she really understood him. He thought about it and decided ot get angry. He hadn't gotten upset in a while and it was a nice change, an opportunity to stretch those muscles. He became furious at her for not knowing, for having to explain something so basic and innate in himself that she didn't seem to understand.</p>
<p>He finished his uproar, and when he looked, her reaction wasn't what he was expecting. She was touched, staring at him intently and in love. She appreciated his honesty. </p>
<p>“That's why I love you” she said, “I thought about it a lot, and I cried over it because I didn't want this, but I love you, like she loves him. It's something like that. Because even during hardship and extreme stress you're so resilient and strong and reliable and is able to do so much with so little. And I stress easily over the smallest things, I feel like you can handle everything so much better. And when I'm studying there all by myself in the middle of the night I miss you, I want you to come and talk, I reall enjoyed it, it was something completely new to me. I've never met anyone like you.</p>
<p>Use silence, stay ambiguous. Ambiguity can go for you.</p>
<p>And then she fell silent for the last time. She walked away. He didn't feel guilty at all...she never argued with him, she never said anything bad ot him, she respected his space whiel he was 'thinking', and she helped him whenever he was weak, and she supported him again and again. But she would not do any of this again, it just wasn't worth it, her time and energy and emotions could go somewhere else. She was usually so independent and confident and strong with herself, but after talking with him she was now finding herself helpless without him. What happened to herself, it was like she couldn't walk straight without his support or something anymore.</p>
<p>Was she upset that he had another lover? Was she happy? Was she accepting? Or did she feel that feeling so experienced at the end of a long day's work, the futility of love? What was she goiing to tell her parents? Or had she just given up, she was putting all the effort in and he wasn't showing any difference. He just kept his 'work' up. Sitting in his room and planning things, or asking her questions out of the blue with no context behind them.,</p>
<p>Or was she excited by the possibilities of it?</p>
<p>She couldn't decide yet.</p>
<p>She didn't know it yet, but this would be her last conversation with Daniel. They never met again, it was a sudden change, just like so many other things. </p>
<p>Forty Seven.3:</p>
<p>People didn't know this yet, but when the truck driver came in with his daughter last time and Mr. Angry greeted them, they had come here for the first time. But it was one of those visits that they had felt very bad about, from the bottom of themselves something was saying “Go, leave this business alone, you shouldn't be here”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry smiled and was polite. He paid them a lot of money beforehand and a hefty bonus afterwards, but they both shared an unspoken feeling of distrust, an anticipation of something horrible about to happen. It usually happened when someone spoke out of line or said something that shouldn't be said. But this time the years between father and daughter didn't change the message at all. They felt like they had done something that should not be done, by anyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry had brought tons of firearms in, all sorts fo different weapons from different parts of the world. What scared the driver, because he was still driving back, was that his daughter had seen the guns and become fascinated by them, like a love story that had just begun to blossom, her love story was beginning here. With these bullets and weapons.</p>
<p>But there was more, Mr. Angry had brought a large bomb in. It was one of those bombs that had a constant steam sound from internal monitoring of the temprature and pressure. And there were pipes from the ends which it used to balance between what was happening in the outside world. That kind of bomb was so specialized that it could only be used for one thing. To blow up safes.</p>
<p>The truck driver sighed and rubbed the sweat on his forehead ot the side, it coagulated into a bubbly lump on the side of his head, like the fizzing white mash on the shore of the sea. He tipped his head over to look at his daughter, she was fast asleep once again, her hands were on her lap and drool ran down her mouth and onto her chair.</p>
<p>He sighed, it was done now. But he would try to move forward with her.</p>
<p>Back in the hotel, the crew were gathered in the meeting room. The light was an uncomfortable bright fluorescence that Mr. Purple had installed in for some reason. No one knew, it was just a spur of the moment thing that she did, and they all went along with it, because eshe was doing it so naturally and matter-of-factly, that it seemed like the normal thing to do.</p>
<p>Then, after she installed the lights, she kneeled down, she was wearing tight black jeans that clamped onto her butt like chains, and short black heels that would need about thirty kicks before they would kill anyone. Her hair was straight and black, and she wore a black hoodie with sparkling black opals on the rims of her sleeves and around the collar of her neck. She dropepd down and reached for her black bag that was hers since High School, she brought out a jigsaw puzzle. This was the first non-black thing on her that the members had seen all day. In fact, Mr. Lazy had even been watching for this. </p>
<p>“This puzzle” she said, “Is our dear leader boss, Mr. Angry” Then she started making the puzzle, first getting the four corners. She curled over the carpet and leaned forward with all fours and started assembling this grand structure.</p>
<p>“How is it Mr. Angry?” Mr. Melancholy only saw a puzzle of the scenery of a far away lake on a night with a full moon. But he went and helped her anyway. Soon they were all helping her, and in twenty minutes it was done.</p>
<p>“How was it Mr. Angry?” Mr. Melancholy asked again. But no one answered, they were all preoccupied with something.</p>
<p>And then he realized and fell in love. What Mr. Purple was doing, he thought, was something so profound, and so similar to what he was thinking that he couldn't believe it, that two people had such similar ways of appraoching the world and solving things like that. </p>
<p>While they were assmebling the puzzles, they had to figure out each one, and slowly slowly as they figured out each one the picture grew and grew, and they saw how it fit into the whole. Mr. Purple deliberately put pieces in the wrong place, some of them with the same colour were just too difficult to do and ambiguous.</p>
<p>But each puzzle piece felt like it was a facet of Mr. Angry's personality, each was so different and so unknown in the whole puzzle, but after a while of blind assortment a picture began to form over the ambiguity. It was like people looking up and describing something that they saw in the clouds, very vague and ambiguous. At least, that was what Mr. Melancholy thought Mr. Purple was feeling in making this puzzle. And through some strange aspect of a charisma, she attracted everyone to sit with her and work on it together.</p>
<p>After the puzzle was done as well, the room fell quiet, like a soothing gas had been sprayed through the room and was now settling peoples' nerves to stop moving and relax. Mr. Angry slipped in the room while the members were lying around making the puzzle, and he stood in the corner and watched. This was their last meeting, after this, the heist was starting. Everyone knew this, and they were nervous, the tension was always there, in every heartbeat. It was like they were preparing for a performance, the grand finale, but instead of aiming to be seen and remembered, they were aiming to become invisible and unseen. That was why these rare moments of quiet unity were so valued.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry respected this ease of tension and sat on the side, doing his favourite hobby, observing everyone. He didn't move forward on the plan for a while, he didn't step back, he just watched and assimilated, like a child facing the world for the first time once again, with an unbounding curiosity and inquistiveness of the worldand learning everything anew.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy came over to the side fo the room, and the others looked from the corners of their eyes and noticed Mr. Angry. From the way they looked, it was obvious he wasn't welcome, he was a nuisance, a hindrance. But he didn't mind, he didn't nurture the group for himself after all. Mr. Melancholy though, was different, there was a respect in his eyes, the rare respect that only a master would be able to see in his disciple. When he was talking to him right now he became Daniel and not Mr. Angry. Mr. Melancholy was not a hard shelled man, but the skinny unpopular foreigner William Weng. Usually, as soon as anyone else entered the room their facades entered as well. It was the first weakness of Daniel that William had seen and the last vulnerability that he exposed. After the heist started there would be no more jokes and building of friendships. He may never get to see these people again. The friendships they had cultivated together would disappear overnight. And so this moment here was as close to a goodbye as it got.</p>
<p>When Mr Angry finally stood up and paced his way to the front, the members became quiet and looked. Most of them disliked him, and most of them were unhappy with how he conducted his affairs, but there was a respect in their distaste. It was because they didn't like him that they listened to what he had to say.</p>
<p>“In all this journey together, before everything starts, I want to apologize for a few things” he said. He didn't move his arms as he used to, they sat in his pockets, tucked away indifferently. There was something about his tone that was apologetic and sincere, yet uncaring at the same time. It was a strange combination of emotions that ran through the room. “I was the one who made the names and insisted on no nonsense outside the names, yet I was the one who was changing them so easily , and who might even be the one who needed these names of escape the most. Remember when Mr. Chatterbox tried to change her name, I yelled at her and got really upset? I said to remember your Standard Operation Procedures, SOP's, like you're all kids or something, and I threw punches of upset.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox remembered it, her eyes rolled to the top right and she thought about it sincerely. She had been hurt at the time, but now it didn't feel like much anymore. She was fine with it.</p>
<p>“And I feel effeminate confessing this to you all, but maybe that's a new manliness meta, to confess whatever's on your mind” he said. “I'm a mysterious man, I'm mysterious to everyone and have many different angles of character, everyone who sees me sees something different. How do I maintain this image? It's a delicate balance of course, but it's also a scary lostlessness, I am a mystery to myself, every moment is unpredicted and out of course, every moment is forged in darkness and stands on no foundation. Sometimes in a dream I think my hidden motivation is that I don't want to be the same as everyone else. I want to be someone completely different, so that if aliens came from wherever the fuck they come from and see the earth, they will see me, and point at me and notice the difference. I see all of these ladies are gathered in the fucking flower shop and eating cake together, or saying things whiel sipping some lukewarm coffee with their wrinkled lips that have been pressed together like a sponge. They talk about things that a thousand others before them have repeated. Or these customers come to this fucking hotel and do the same things that everyone else is doing, asking us the same questions about how we made the fucking bed. I want to be different, if people are healing the world I will be the one to destroy it. If people are talking and joking, I will make it silent. And if people are silent and not giving a fuck, I will start the talking, it's very simple, that's all I want, to stand out and be different.”</p>
<p>It was a very shallow goal, extremely unfulfilling and very variegated. It was completely dependent on the surroundings and didn't actually mean anything identity wise. Perhaps in his shallowness and vanity, Mr. Angry had become the greatest enigma and the most confusing human.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Angry knew he wouldn't be able to do anything if he stood by himself all the time. Years of separating himself from the crowd and leading the pack took a toll on him, he became lonely, the years of isolation had been battering away at him and chipping away at his sanity slowly but surely.
He had long forgotten that his most hidden motivation was that he wanted to be the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>{(MORALITY, this comes right ebfore the final heist is starting, and after the character introductions. So it gives a clear contrast of how everyone has differing morals.</p>
<p>As Mr. Angry made his confession, the mood changed again, it turned to honesty, to vulnerability, even amongst so many men. “Can I ask a question again?” Mr. Chatterbox said. “It's kind of the same question I already asked about”</p>
<p>“Are we allowed to steal?” she said.</p>
<p>“I don't get it, of course we aren't?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“No” Mr. Melancholy said, “I think she means something more like, Is it okay to steal”</p>
<p>“I don't know” Mr. Chatterbox said, “Sometimes I just wish, that if we did something wrong we would be punsihed. And if we did something good then we should be rewarded. Because aren't those the two pillars upholding the world?”</p>
<p>“But it's okay if nothing happens, we can do our own things” Mr. Purple said, “I used to be scared like you as well, I wanted some kind of order, some kind of system to live by, to direct me...”</p>
<p>“No, it's not like that” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I mean, it's kind of like that but not really.” She looked down, “I just want to stop getting hurt by the same things all the time, that's all. It's like I never learn”</p>
<p>This hurt William, because he felt like he knew why she was saying this. He felt responsible for making her feel this way. And a deep part of him was happy as well, that he wouldn't have to be here with her any longer. After the heist they would go their separate ways.</p>
<p>“It's an interesting remark” Mr. Danger said. He crossed his arms and uncrossed them as if he couldn't decide on where to put his arms. “Because in this life everyone is just living their own good life, they do what is good for them in their own way, and yet everyone's good lives are all so different. So how can we dispense justice to people when everyone's being just in their own way, because doesn't justice imply goodness?”</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox was surprised, her heartfelt questionw as being talked about so smoothly by everyone, they had all thought about it before. “I know that you guys are really great, you would never lie to me, because there's no need to, and there's an innocence and a naivete about our group that no other group has, well they do, but it's rare to find.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox, are you in the same group as all of us?” Mr. Lazy said. “We are not naiive, we're stealing, that's like the least naiive thing anyone can do.”</p>
<p>“Yes” she nodded, “But it's also like so sweet, because we are so dedicated we have become so naiive and compassionate to each other. That's why I'm asking everyone here these questions that I feel uncomfortable asking anywhere else”</p>
<p>“I don't get it” Mr. Purple said, “Why are you so confused by this, just now we were talking about coffee, salad, and guys” She shooed at Mr. Melancholy and Mr. Angry, “They were talking about something else, so what's this got to do with any of that? Can't you live your life without having to ask questions every two seconds? Gosh, you're so needy. Some things are not meant to be resolved because no one knows the answer. The answer is to live with the ambiguity and to stop caring. There are dark areas and they're dark for a reason. No light that you will shine will make it any clearer because every light has its own shadows that block something else. Learn to see the beauty in the gray. Nothing is crystal clear okay?” She nudged him, “Are you listening? Recently you just nod and then walk off, I don't know what you're thinking, communication is important for a couple you know, it's just important in general, even for a piece of shit meeting like this one”</p>
<p>“Yeah” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>Beside her, Mr. Danger looked down, he knew he was a disgrace, but he was also a pervert. And when she said it like that he felt even worse, and turned on...How many people were turned on, no one would ever know because it wasn't something you told other people too freely.</p>
<p>Beside him, Mr. Melancholy was conflicted and troubled by the heist, especially by the morality of it, he was sitting with his legs apart, his elbows resting on his knees. He saw everyone else living normally and talking to him normally and respecting his space, and it was strange, because he felt like he hadn't done anything to deserve it. He wanted to say something along the lines of, “Don't respect my space, I'm a nobody creature who shouldn't be recognized as an equal member, I should have no place. But everyone respected him, they didn't know any different and life was the same for them whether he did this or that. There were no fireworks to reward him for doing something kind and no police to stop him from doing something bad. Sometimes some good and bad step in at unexpected times, but overall it was dreary with no change, just the constant beat of a heart, the constant rhythm of success and failure, and the relentless dying and birth of a new love.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy turned beside him and told this to Mr. Purple. Mr. Purple was suddenly very interested, captivated even, by his confession.</p>
<p>“Did you know I know all about everything?” she said, “You've come to ask the right person” She brought out a checklist from her bag, it had piles and piles of notes in it. “These are some notes for depression” she said, “But there's a lot more in here as well”</p>
<p>It was true, under her hand he could see thousands of papers. Did she carry them around everywhere? Why did she have so much in her small bag? Just what was she excited about?
“You sound depressed, lack of enthusiasm with everything” she underlined some words with her finger. Her handwriting on the paper was picture perfect, it looked like something out of a magazine.</p>
<p>“But actually, I am enthusiastic about girls” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“You changed one symptom...ok” Mr. Purple put her papers down and brought out another set. Her process was like a machine learning decision tree based on rules. She opened up a different page and started going through it. “Never mind, you fit Bi-polar disorder more” she said, “You've got bi-polar disorder” She flipped through a few more pages, “Or maybe you have BPD, it fits a lot of the symptoms”</p>
<p>“What do you say in your experience?” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“I don't know, these notes are everyone's experiences so they should be enough right?”</p>
<p>The simplicity of her logic was almost believable.</p>
<p>“So what do I do then”</p>
<p>“It says in these cases you usually will die if not treated”</p>
<p>“So what do I do?”</p>
<p>“Maybe take a sleeping pill? I don't know, I'm not a doctor”</p>
<p>“Then why are you holding the book?” She looked confused and offended but relaxed, “Okay nevermind, give me the pill”</p>
<p>“Wait” she said, holding her hand up to his face, “Maybe it's your job, maybe that's what should satisfy you better. It says here...” Then she flipped a few more pages, “Wait, maybe it's your friends, they aren't the supportive types of friends that you should be having.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy rolled his eyes. “Just give me the label” he said, “Isn't that what you're trying to do? If you can at least label me, then I can fit into somewhere, right now I'm not fititng in anywhere.”</p>
<p>Beside Mr. Melancholy and Mr. Purple, Mr. Lazy and Mr. Angry were discussing morality, or whatever vague concept of it they could find.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was peeling a mandarin, his hands were large and highly structured, at the tips of each finger were millions of neurons which were so sensitive that they could feel the difference in the patterns of miniscule fibers. The mandarin entereed his mouth, and the sense of taste in his mouth was able to detect any small amount of bitterness or poison that might be able to harm it. </p>
<p>“Every action has a consequence, a result, some of the results come immediately, like being punished by parents.” Mr. Lazy said. “But some of the consequences come after a month, a week, or a year, or a decade later. And then you start to feel it, and the repercussions last longer, a lot longer.
Or some even might come after you've died, and they might even go to someone else. And you feel the result of your actions, and you regret it so much, but there's nothing you can do, you have already made your decision.”</p>
<p>“I don't know about this heist and the consequences” Mr. Angry said, “But it's yours to make the decision, there are so many decisions every second, but you also have to know which of these decisions are long term, and which ones will be important.</p>
<p>“Yes, but to be moral, is to do things because they are right, not because they're fun, or easy, or give some kind of an immediate reward. And going against temptations as well.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven4-contrasting-morality-with-work-life">forty seven.4:  Contrasting morality with work life</h3>
<p>On this evening William sits in his room with the curtains drawn and light yellow orange light filtering through. He is watching pornography he got from his friend when a call comes in from his female supervisor, he is fucked and turns the volume down when he answers, the boss talks about all sorts of things and they make jokes, the boss asks him to get to work and he says it's fine if he is at work in ten minutes.</p>
<p>William turns the video off, he opens the curtains and gets changed. In ten minutes he is at work with no trace of what he was doing just now, but he hasn't washed his dick. The other women at work see him and think he is really attractive. One man does as well.</p>
<p>The woman who comes into the store has a philosophy, she doesn't really tell anyone this, but it is her way of understanding the world around her. If a man smells like the fish market, he is excited, if it is tuna, it means he roams around a lot, if it is salmon, then your baby will be healthy. But if it is sardines, it probably won't be very good, so leave it behind. This woman usually wants to know, so she goes all the way to test it out.</p>
<p>Before going to work, William gets another phone call, he is half dressed in his uniform when the call vibrates in his left pocket. He scoops it out and starts talking. He balances his talking with equally intense moments of listening. “Please be serious” he said, “Have you had it raw with other guys as well?”</p>
<p>He's walking into work now, so has to cut off the conversation. He had to be there two minutes ago, and his boss was waiting for him at the counter, acting friendly. But was  upset. Black told William off for doing something wrong, inappropriate, again. And William was starting to see how his character was not fit for this. He wasn't made to do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>As soon as work was over he got back on the phone with the woman “Because you're willing to do it with me during your 'safe' period, so you must have done it with other guys as well.” He had barely walked out of the store with his phone cradled against his ear. His supervisor Elizabeth saw him talking like this and had her arms crossed in disapprovement. </p>
<p>ON any day, William would have just walked past without thinking much about it, he would have just gone on with his life. But today was different, today he was smelt something in her gaze. It was strange and difficult to pinpoint, but he felt like it was something fresh.</p>
<p>He hung up the phone with a few buttons and turned around. Elizabeth looked at him with an intense gaze. In her eyes were written the long stories of years past and the experiences of many loves. The fact that there was this in her eyes probably meant that she was thinking something related to it.</p>
<p>The store was almost closing, customers were trickling through, and things were slowing down. Right now felt like a time to talk.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt it too, she whispered, “You want some advice on your work?” That was the way she talked, never directly, but as if something urgent was happening that she needed to attend to. William played along with her. She made him wait ten minutes while she closed up the store, tidied the desks, printed out preparations for tomorrow, and then she took him to the cafe upstairs. It was empty, the lights were off, and there she moved two chairs back. She turned a small light on so it shone over them like a spotlight. He sat down and Elizabeth went to get some refreshments. While she was gone, William looked around, it was so quiet and serene, the mountains were dark, and the cafe was empty. During the day it was so busy and peope stressed about where to go next, about their orders, the staff stressed about the plates and the influx of customers, an order that they got wrong, the long working hours they had to plough through, and the interpersonal issues that arose.</p>
<p>But right now was quiet. There were no sounds, only the timid steps of Elizabeth. William watched her walk. It was strange, there was something on her mind. It could be anything that she wanted, a normal conversation, a sharing of a secret, a confidant, or a rough pounding. No one would know until she explained herself.</p>
<p>The answer came sooner than expected, when she sat down she was holding two glasses of water. Just a plain drink in a plain place, her hair was tied back and she was still wearing her uniform. It was a general disregard of her self that he noticed. “At one point” she said.”I was actually serious about you” She said it and smirked, it was a funny thought in the past, something that didn't hold value anymore.</p>
<p>“You were? I never noticed” he said. </p>
<p>“I was waiting” she said, “The whole time, I was waiting for you to make a move on me, but you didn't, you made a move on the receptionist girl, and cute Jeena, and a bunch of other women, but never with me” She sighed, “I wonder what it is about me”</p>
<p>“Well how about now?” he said.</p>
<p>“You're not monogamous, you sleep around freely while being exclusive, you hunger for new experiences.”</p>
<p>“Why are you saying that?” he said. </p>
<p>“I have been watching you, that's all, and that's what I got from it”</p>
<p>“It's never too late...”</p>
<p>“No” she shook her head, slowly, but like she was so sure of it that it didn't really matter. “There's a man called Daniel, do you know him?”</p>
<p>Now William was interested, “Why do you speak that name?”</p>
<p>“I slept with him” she said it so simply that he wasn't sure, he needed to hear it again. But he didn't want to...</p>
<p>“Of all the guys, why him?”</p>
<p>“I don't know, I never thought about it” She said, “Maybe it was a mistake, or it might have been the best thing I ever did”</p>
<p>William walked out of the cafe leaving Elizabeth there, he threw the chair out of his way and dumped the water out. He went and asked Daniel if he really did it. He found him sitting in the staff lounge over a bowl of instant noodles that he sipped up to form the squiggles of his new brain. “I did” Daniel shrugged and said they should focus on the job, not on women.</p>
<p>It was here that William exploded, Daniel tried to calm him, he said that William could have his woman in compensation. </p>
<p>William spoke everything, “Is this a shopping market to you? Can you just trade women with other women like you're replacing a product for another one that is more expensive, or less used? Then is that how you see us, your crew as well? That we're all just replacements for your perfect system.” </p>
<p>“What?” Daniel said. “Why are you saying that all of a sudden? Why is everyone saying that?”</p>
<p>“It's not only me, someone else hinted it to me, I'm just repeating what they said to back it up. What is wrong with you? Why does everything have to be a replacement of something else? I'm doing it because I want to, no other reason. And I'm not the only oen saying this, others are saying it as well, a lot of people think it.”</p>
<p>“Really? Like who” </p>
<p>“I'm not going to list names, that's low” William said, “But if you're always looking for replacements when will you ever be able to form something that is worth a lot in itself?”</p>
<p>They were confused, everyone was saying different things. About everything, about Mr. Angry, about Mr. Melancholy, and who the fuck were these people anyway?</p>
<p>“Look, it doesn't matter, I didn't touch her” Daniel said. “I wouldn't, even if she's not yours.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” William said. </p>
<p>“Because she was saying that it would be safe to do it raw, because she was at a 'safe' time. This was what some other dude told me”</p>
<p>“What, some other dude? What's a 'safe' time.”</p>
<p>“She sleeps around fucker, didn't you know that? Or do you need a dictionary?” He held out a stack of papers and wrote the definition in clear words, “FUCKER”</p>
<p>“You see what's happening here, your sex life draws us further apart.”</p>
<p>“Has she ever had an abortion? Is she fine with that?” William said. “And was she deliberate about it just with him? How can a man trust that?”</p>
<p>She argued with this dude apparently, they argued about a lot, and one of their frequent arguments was about trust. William could picture them arguing with each other, a big dream bubble came up and showed him what was happening. The two were standing face to face, her, and a sleazy dude with chains around his belt hanging down. His hair hadn't been washed, and his jacket looked like a rat.</p>
<p>“You only trust me when it's the worst case scenario, but when I tell you the truth and it;s not what you want to hear, then you say I'm lying, why don't you trust me It's a two-way street okay? You're a paranoid little fuck. Loook up the definition of that.” </p>
<p>“Stop swearing” he hated listening to her speak so unconventionally, it made it seem like there were locusts or a sandstorm in the air, so noisy. He closed his eyes and shook his head slowly, like some kind of transcendental presence that was higher than her. She sensed it and slapped him.</p>
<p>“This place” Daniel said, “Everyone comes here in a relationship, they're all happily tied down with someone else. They announce that they have a boyfriend when they come, and usually two weeks later they break up.”</p>
<p>“Why do they break up?” William said.</p>
<p>Daniel leaned back in his usual way, it meant that his old self was back. The one William was familiar and comfortable with. “You go and ask them” he pointed across the table, his finger was strong and hard, the nails were weathered. “There's one there” A girl sat across the table, she looked like a new arrival, her hair was done up neatly and her clothes were clean. She looked like a freshly painted house.</p>
<p>William didn't ask, he didn't want to ruin the momentum that they were holding right now. Daniel saw it. “Look, when I first met you, you were kind of like her”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You were sitting here as well, like her, a bit more messy, but I could see you had a strong framework”</p>
<p>“A strong framework?” William said, “What does you mean?” If anything, he felt like he had almost no framework. </p>
<p>“You were one of the first members I scouted, apart form Mr. Purple, the others came after you. I was sure of you, more sure than with the others. I saw you and confided in what was a quiet guy who never said anything much about anything. But I knew you were thinking, highly conscious and thinking about everything that was happening. Even more, we got along and get talking really well.</p>
<p>Now that it was coming to the end Daniel was saying all of this. And William saw how Daniel, despite being so cold and distancing himself from all of the superficial aspects, enjoyed this. This was the part of it he enjoyed. It must be.</p>
<p>“And this quiet guy in front of me, a total stranger, says he has also thought about it, how it is possible every now and then to steal a lot of money, but he always needed someone else, but didn't have anyone he could trust.” Daniel was smiling now, “It was remarkable for me, you're thinking the exact same thing I was thinking. We may have a lot of differences, but we stumbled on this the same way. And you, this quiet guy, you told me of a woman you knew who was talking about her life, everyone thinks she's disgusting, but actually she's a really kind and interested and lovely woman who treats everyone well.”</p>
<p>“Did I say that?” William tried to remember.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and I knew from that story that you were trustworthy, so I invited you in, with your trust I gave you the most loyal and most demanding job you will ever find. Who knows, you may even miss it one day.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I remember now” William said, “She's crude and laughs about fart jokes, but she respects her friends as well. For some reason, even after she's kind to others, no one really cares about her much. But beside her, there's another girl, one of those girls you walk past a lot and never see much, she's quiet and keeps to herself, she never bothers anyone, but she gets all of the attention. It's a strange thing, getting attention from others.”</p>
<p>“But the biggest similarity between all of us, the thing keeping us together” Daniel said, “People don't change suddenly, it has always been in you to do something like this, maybe since six or seven, or since you were born. It's something that will really mess people up and something that will change the world and how people think and act. You want to affect everyone, do something that will change things. Yet you have a low regard for social structure and the systems that are already in place.”</p>
<p>At the same time as this conversation, in the staff dining, the employees were gathering. One table had three of the heist members, Mr. Danger, Mr. Lazy, and Mr. Chatterbox. They were gathered together and talking about other heists. The three of them stood up together and made their way to the meeting spot. It was full of people, all sorts of things were happening. People everywhere were talking. The three of them walked past everyone in a file, with a purpose in the way they walked, and focused eyes. They walked through the doorway, swingin the door open, not holding it open for anyone else. Their shoes hit the same place on the carpet and sunk into the same fibres. First was Mr. Danger's brown polished shoe, then Mr. Lazy's rugged soles, followed by the thin pinprick of Mr. Chatterbox's heel. They had a normal dinner, bored with each other, too comfrotable and complacent with each other's presence. And then they filed into the apartment at the same pace. Like a train that was coming into a station that it had entered hundreds of thousands of times before.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox shut the door behind them in one motion sat down in the closest chair. Her shoes  slipped off and she crossed her legs. This was the apartment where they planned and practiced everything, the guys stared at her. They knew something and were unhappy. Mr. danger had a frown on his face that was twinkling with disorder.</p>
<p>“There've been plenty of people stealing things” Mr. Lazy said. “I did my research, and they all failed. But it's because none of them planned it out properly”</p>
<p>“Yes” Mr.Chatterbox agreed, this wasn't the part that she was dissatisfied with, it was what came next. “But how are we any different? I looked at the history as well, some of these people were extremely smart, and they were also going for the chastity belt, the same legendary one that we're going for. How do you know we'll be any different to these others who have fallen short?” </p>
<p>“I know” Mr. Lazy said. “I just know”</p>
<p>“Mr. Lazy” Mr. Chatterbox said, her legs still crossed, juggling the tips of her toes like they were a funny joke. “I'm a single woman, I've got a boyfriend, but he's pah, and Mr. Danger's single, as far as I can tell” Mr. Danger nodded beside her. He was happy with that status. “But you're not” she said, “You're a married man, and there's a lot of those around, but none of them were in heists.”</p>
<p>“True” Mr. Lazy said. “But that doesn't change our odds, it could just mean that I'm more serious than all of you. I've got more at stake, so I'll work harder to succeed with it.”</p>
<p>“Look, I'll let you guys in on a secret about me” Mr. Chatterbox said, “What if I said that it turns out I'm depressed, I mean seriously depressed. It turns out I was born this way, and when I was five the first picture I drew was of something my parents immediately disapproved of. I was a teen and in art class I only drew maps of plans for how to kill myself. It was like a strange and morbid passion. I would constantly plan it out to work, and perfect it. I'd modify it with all sorts of things in an attempt to make myself do things better. You guys know I'm extremely organized and do things to the top of my level, but in the end it was still kind of useless. This heist is similar in how we use morals, or plan out things and then act them out with a tremendous courage in the face of debilitating fear and risk.</p>
<p>“But Mr. Chatterbox...” Mr. Lazy was shocked, “How does that make any sense? You're like one of the happiest in our group.”</p>
<p>“I am” she said, “And I'm also one of the most messed up. I don't know how messed up you lot are, but I've actually got serious issues, I clean up well don't I?”</p>
<p>She did, she hid them so well that no one suspected them. But if she was hiding them so desperately, why did she still have to reveal herself now? The answer was in the way she looked back at them. There were no tears, but the look on her face was like a cloth next to the sink that had dried up after cleaning up a messy mess. If she didnt' tell them, then no one would know who she was. Even her parents and her family might not know, her best friends might never know either. And the fact that she was telling them now meant that they might be her best friends. Closer to her than anyone else, like her boyfriend, could ever be.</p>
<p>It was scary to think that they, who had no attachment to her, and almost no relations, were her closest confidants.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox was attempting to tell these men that a plan was a plan wherever it was, it didn't make the plan any more special. That was the only reason why she brought up her personal history. Otherwise she would never do such an embarrassing thing. But after she said it she knew that it had slipped over their heads. They weren't thinking about it at all.</p>
<p>“I don't know about plans, but about the heist, Mr. Angry actually invited someone else to see it with us.” Mr. Danger said. “It was before us, Mr. Angry's previous heist”</p>
<p>“He had a previous one?” Mr. Chatterbox said it like she had been cheated on. </p>
<p>“Of course” Mr. Danger said, “Someone dressed so shabbily has to have something else to be able to get away with it. If someone is dressed shabbily in a socially elite group, you would assume there's a reason why. But anyway, he asked this guy to join the heist as well, but the guy refused. He at frist refused gently, but later put his hand up and adamantly refused. It was one of those incorrigible moments in Mr. Angry's history.”</p>
<p>“What were his reasons?” Mr. Lazy said, “It's hard to refuse something as lucrative and promising as Mr. Angry's proposals. If he asked me to marry him I would have a hard time refusing.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox laughed, “You know, I can kind of picture that, it's sort of funny, you standing there and him kneeling in front of you, and you're kind of conflicted about what to do.”</p>
<p>“Don't laugh” Mr. Danger said, “The reason the man refused wasn't very clear, he had a lot of reasons, but it was something to do with integrity.”</p>
<p>“Oooh, that's rare, and interesting” Mr. Chatterbox said. Her eyes widened, she knew she liked this story. It was something familiar that hit home for her. </p>
<p>“He said they had no morals at all, they did whatever they wanted, they said whatever they wanted, and they got away with it. I guess to him it's incredibly unfair. So he said no, and surprisingly, Mr. Angry accepted that. They planned the huge heist, and the person who wasn't invited wouldn't tell anyone, he also didn't join the heist because he felt it was wrong to steal money. But he probably also felt very left out because of it. Sometimes if you stand for your morals, you also have to be prepared to become lonely because of it. Loneliness comes in many different forms, in good actions and bad actions, it's an elusive ubiquity that coexsits with us.</p>
<p>“You see, so I wasn't that strange was I” Mr. Chatterbox said, “When I asked those questions in front of the group you guys ostracized me like I was speaking nonsense or something, but it was the only thing that made sense right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he's still here right now” Mr. Lazy didn't answer her because he wasn't surehe agreed, “I mean it was also at the hotel right? The man could be watching from afar to see what's happening.”</p>
<p>“You have to be careful of leaders like Mr. Angry though” Mr. Chatterbox said. “I've lost a lot of things before so I know this pattern. He's the type of criminal who will throw away everything important to him at the drop of a dime. If there's any tension then at the first sign of something going wrong or getting overtly risky he'll disappear. I don't think we matter to him very much, he'll throw us and his plans away like it's tissue paper. Sure he has his reasons for the heist, I'm not questioning that. He probably wants this to mean something, but he can't find what that is, that's why he watns to do the heist. Because maybe this will help him find it. That's what I think.”</p>
<p>Mr. Danger said, “All he wants is the money, no one's sure of his motivations, which is actually fine, but what's not fine is that he himself doesn't know what he wants, and that's really scary.”</p>
<p>“So you both don't trust him?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>The two of them shook their heads immediately. “We spend so much time with him, we hear him talk and be so passionate, yet we trust him so little. It's a strange thing how friendships work. </p>
<p>Behidn them, an ear was sticking out. The three of them didnt' notice it, but the big rubbish can next to the window moved slightly. An ear was poking out of the top, if Mr. Chatterbox raised her gaze from Mr. Danger in front of her, to a bit further right and 34 degrees higher, she may have seen the little ear. It was a cute ear rounded like a conch shell, and if you put your ear next to it you could probably hear the imaginary sea that existed in the realm of dreams.</p>
<p>The ear belonged to Charlotte, by chance she had come in here to clear some rubbish, then she suddenly felt a strong anxiety, a panic attack that was gushing through her body and screaming to be released, she crawled in the barrel and closed the lid, sitting like this in the dark made her feel calm. 
Then she heard voices, at first it was the voice of her rival for William's love, Annalise. But there were a few other men. She tipped her head up, her ear poked out and the conversation became clearer to her. Like in a submarine you would tip the binoculars out to see afar. It was a similar concept and she loved it.</p>
<p>As they talked she started to see what was happening. At first she wanted them to leave so she could get back to work, but as time passed she saw that this was related to William, and now she knew what he had spent so much of his time doing, this.</p>
<p>He was going for such a deep and important thing. She never imagined that someone like him was doing something so big. She was both immensely impressed and afraid for him. It was the first the she had heard he was scared of anything. As she listened, her doubts were confirmed, in a place like this gossip was supposed to spread, but whenever it was anything about William, it was like the tree roots had been cut off and there was no information available whatsoever. She felt like she was messed up for liking William, but now she knew she was. He was such a bad man, he did nothing for society, he contributed nothing, but she couldn't help her feelings for him. She felt like everything she wanted to do he did so anyway, and it was kind of relieving to be with someone as proactive as him. But also because everyone here was saying things, and it made her feel comfortable to be with him. But also because she knew what he was going to do next, because she thought in exactly the same way as he does. He didn't realize it yet, but when he did, he would shun her. She could predict his actions and how he would feel before he was even able to do so himself.</p>
<p>The people here had become thieves in her eyes. Highly organized and disguised thieves. She was excited for them, but also a bit jealous, that they would be able to get so much but she would still be working in reception. They talked about big money, big ambitions, and doing effective things all the time that would change the world. They were all chasing something, that is what they wanted to be doing. And Charlotte finally realized just why she liked William. He was a normal man, relaxed, kind, and gentle. But there were hundreds of fish like that with the same qualities on their CV. They would offer her the same and even more. </p>
<p>What made William stand out to her was his ambition. He was always chasing something, and that was irreplaceable in her eyes. The people around here were mostly unmoving and stuck in their ways, but he was different, like a shining star. And she would try to support him with that, whatever it was, she decided.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all William was, was what he was going after. If he was trying to pull off a heist he was a thief. If he was trying to chase a girl, he was a lover. And if he was working, he was a salaryman. Maybe that wasn't what she wanted, he wasn't grounded in anything, it wasn't what she was looking for.</p>
<p>So as she listened to the conversation with her cute ear sticking out, Charlotte contemplated what it was that she wanted, and whether William would actually do. The fact that she even ahd ot think about it meant that she wasn't thinking too much about this man.</p>
<p>And what scared her a bit was, what if William stopped chasing her. He could just as quickly lose interest and stop chasing her. As soon as he obtained something then he lost interest in it. Because it became predictable and mundane, and it was possible to see what was coming next. The challenge was gone, and then he had to move on to the next challenge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Charlotte was thinking about other people, she went back to morality, as her anchor in this foggy world. She thought with no morality people were blind, Like little cells with each one doing their own thing and selfish, because they had no way of guiding themselves other than to fulfill what they had been planning to do. So they only do what is right for themselves and brings them pleasure. This was such a basic simple concept of human life.</p>
<p>She thought about a culture she knew, it was so bad, this culture was all about the looks, if you didn't look good then you were useless, and how you sounded on the radio as well. You had to be cute to get on the television.</p>
<p>If you weren't attractive you couldn't do anything, you didn't attract attention and you got bullied everywhere by society. As if every single person had written a contract agreeing to treat you differently. It was the only time they would unite to do anything in their lives. Prettiness gets you very far in life. It was a huge commodity, and it had become such a truth that it was just normal now. And you spend nine months making it hoping that it would turn out?</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy had thought about it for the past while, he started debating the morals behidn the heist. It was funny, he had never really thought about it much before, but now that it was here in his face, he wouldn't go about not thinking about it. People always started debating the morals behind the heist and he usually said it didn't even matter, he didn't care about any of these things at all. They could say anything they liked. “The morals or whatever, they don't matter, discussing it isn't going to change anything” he said.</p>
<p>“Why won't you listen” Mr. Chatterbox said. “Isn't that what I've been saying this whole time?” Her eyes brows tilted like a piece of bamboo being blown in the wind.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy explained, “Because everyone has different reasons, I'm sick of listening to everyone tell me how to live my life. And then tell me to live my life my own way, everyone's full of contradictions. I tried to live one life, and I tried to live another life, and after a while, I just got sick of it.”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven5-purple">forty seven.5: Purple:</h3>
<p>Mr. Purple told Mr. Melancholy how she joined the team. They were sitting next to each other and she felt like talking. She wasn't sure herself, she just felt like it at the time. </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy looked at her with the eye of a scientist. He observed how he saw her last time, she was amazing outside of work and really attractive all the time.</p>
<p>“So, people tell me that I'm a Beautiful woman” she opened with a forward statement, “They tell me I'm so pretty and at the height of my prettiness, that things will only get better for me from here.”</p>
<p>“Really?” He was a bit suspicious why she was suddenly telling him this.</p>
<p>“The last time I told the story was to him” she was pointing to Mr. Angry who was sitting there looking over everything blankly. “When he recruited me. I told him how I had so many options and was riding on a big wave, So, that's what everyone tells me. And when I was talking to him, I  sat down, finally, making him more comfortable, and I looked at him for the first time, and I said to him. So why should I work for you? Your dodgy scheme, what benefit does it bring me? I might go to jail, why should I risk that when I can just find a rich husband somewhere who can give me all of this?”</p>
<p>“So, if this is all what other people are thinking, then what do you yourself think?” William said.</p>
<p>Her smile dropped like holding a hot cake straight out of the oven, “That's none of your business”</p>
<p>“But...” he felt weird, she was the one who brought up her personal life so directly, and now she was taking it away from him just when he was beginning to see it.</p>
<p>“And, because I've always had these options around me, I've never tried to stretch out a hand, they always come to me” she said. “I think you've seen it as well”</p>
<p>Among them, Mr. Purple was the most elusive, and she was elusive because she didn't show anything to the group, she didn't contribute much, yet everyone cared about her a lot, enough to be inquisitive and talk to her. This made her not have to do anything. And, in some ways she took advantage of it.</p>
<p>William suddenly knew what to say, “Because you've never had anything for yourself, you've just been relying on others to provide you with things, that's why this is an important opportunity for you, we all need free expression of your will, a mark that we really do exist in this world apart from just being in the stream. Dont you want to thrash?”</p>
<p>“A mark...” she said, looking up at the chandelier hanging up above them. There were so many pieces of glass each reflecting a different way, everyone was saying things differently. She felt like she needed to say something special to someone.</p>
<p>“But here's the real reason” William went on, even if she didn't want him to, “Because you're a horrible person, you need to do something bad, something illegal, something to wreck the world, so that your outside character matches your horrible insides, and if you have the chance you won't turn it down. Deep down inside you, you know that it'a the right choice, nothing has seemed more congruent to you”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, like some magic words that she had waited a lifetime for had finally awakened her deep inside. This was supposed to be an insult, but in some strange way, she took it as a compliment...there were not enough words to describe the way she was feeling.</p>
<p>And she was touched, because a beautiful woman like her really does want to be seen for who she really is, and not for who she is always seen to be. Even just once was enough. She was more than what these people said of her. She was a kind of truth that was elusive.</p>
<p>When long ago, Mr. Angry asked Mr. Purple to join the team, they had had the conversation as she repeated it to Mr. Melancholy just now. But there was more added to the end. Mr. Angry was standing at the dirty kitchen counte,r there were breadcrumbs lying near the toaster and a chair slanted sideways. The cushion on it was worn down on the sides and a small hole gaped in the middle, exposing the inner bland yellow foam. That foam was the common stuff everywhere, and it seemed like if you poked anything hard enough, that same yellow foam would come out and swallow everything whole.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry said it, and Mr. Purple walked away dismissively, her attitude was as she described. At least what she knew of it. She walked off and the others, Mr. Danger and Mr. Lazy went up to Mr. Angry, watching her walk off.</p>
<p>“Do you think she'll join us?” one of them said. It was unimportant which.</p>
<p>“I don't know” Mr.Angry said, “That's a decision she has to make, no one else can make that decision for her, and she'll live with the consequences of it.” He laughed, “Nah, she'll do it, I'm just playing with you.” </p>
<p>“How do you know?” The other one said. It was unimportant which.</p>
<p>“I trust she'll come because that's what she really wants, to live for her own consequences and not someone else's.” Mr. Angry said. And so long ago, before anything started, he was true to his word, he predicted her actions before she had even thought them through and come to her most comfotrable decision.</p>
<p>While Mr.Purple and Mr. Melancholy were talking, Mr. Chatterbox had moved off to the side. She was breathign slightly deeper than normal and her heartbeat was slightly faster. She sat near the window and looked at everyone with ease. She was in a mood that was slightly nostalgic, she knew she was going to miss everyone, these meetings, and the strange jokes that everyone told. Over time, just doing nothing together, they had all grown closer. At least she felt so, and she hoped the others felt that way as well.</p>
<p>Pleasure was something you saw when you finally looked around and noticed that you were surrounded by it. Love was that time when you are walking and looking at each step carefully, then when you look up you realize you're in the middle of a beautiful garden. A moment ago and now was completely different. That moment you look up and see the world, wasn't that the most beautiful thing? That moment was love, and it quickly went away. So you repeated this action, always looking up each time to see the garden, sometimes you go to a different garden, sometimes you go with a friend. Everyone was different but what was important wasn't the looking up or the garden or the steps you took; but it was the feeling itself. And each one of us was trying to find that feeling in their own way, and that was why we are all in conflict with each other, because they also needed each other. And Charlotte felt like up util now she done so many things, so many temporary jobs, so many relationships that didn't last, so many relationships that came with jobs, so many things she bought and threw away. And each time, it was lik she entereed it wholeheartedly, but each time something was a little off, and she wandered a step away to find something slightly different. And by wandering a step at a time she had ended up in a different country.</p>
<p>While Charlotte was thinking this, across the room, Mr. Danger had left the chat, he went to talk to Mr. Angry. He had his hands in his pockets arrogantly smirking around. No one knew at what, but he seemed to be in the mood, so that was okay.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple had a deep chat with Mr. Lazy about why he was doing this heist. They left the meeting room, under the supervision of everyone around them. They didnt' care anymroe fi they were seen. Besides, Mr. Lazy knew that Mr. Purple was so secretive, and he also knew that no one else would say anything about what happened in the heist.</p>
<p>“It's because, for me at least, freedom costs money. It's a daily rate, relationships cost money, it's an emotional rate, everything costs money, it's a hidden rate. And having more money lets you buy more freedom. There's always a rate, it's just that you have to see it. Every person has their rate, sometimes it's not clear until later just how much, and what you're paying them, or receiving from them. It's a ambiguous transaction most of the time where both parties choose to disclose information of the sale. Some people are there to take things from you, they approach you politely and ask you for something, and you do the same to others. Some people are there to steal from you, they demand things from you, and you do the same to them. Everyday you have to produce something to pay these rates, because they keep nagging you saying that they will raise their rates. There is no rest, rest was your childhood, or your coffin; choose whichever comes to you earlier.If you rest, then you dry up and are thrown into the gutter, collected by the garbagemen in the early horus of the morning so that your departure isn't seen. I have friends who do that job, people just give up sometimes, and the garbage man takes them. There is a Freedom in my house and privacy, is threatened to be taken away if I don't pay it, the relationships are constantly becoming more serious, the man wants to get married, then he wants kids, then he wants an expensive coffin with all of his vital belongings stuffed inside, then he wants to look attractive after he has died, Then he wants you to tell him you love him everyday or else he can't go to work feeling secure. It's so stressful and annoying, it's so not worth it. The woman has to be made to feel beautiful everyday, and she has to see some progress in her man, she needs to feel like she is being taken somewhere, and not just left there. And the supermarket prices are always changing, and she cries when she is unhappy, and you have to attend to that, and you have to make her laugh a lot. And she feels like she needs to be interesting and worthwhile and attractive enough for you to be with her. And if you stop, then you regret stopping, or regret something else further back from long ago. It's just a constant ball rolling down to somewhere, no one knows. I feel like I've been in this ball since I was a kid, thank heavens I didn't know at the time.”</p>
<p>The two had walked along the top tier of the open floors in the hotel. Mr. Purple took Mr. Lazy to a far room, there were things along the side, but she had a masterkey. “Which room do you want?” She looked back normally, it wasn't seductive, it wasn't even trying, it was just really happening.</p>
<p>They pushed a door open, it didn't matter which of them had, they just went in. They both slipped on the bed. And that was when Mr. Lazy realized what was happening. If he did anything here, he was cheating on Laura, or Lisa, or whatever his wife's name was. “Maybe that's why my relationships don't work though” he contradicted himself, and she runs her fingers along his neck, feeling the smoothness of his skin, the structure of his muscle. The way she did it, he thought she was used to this. Did she do this with everyone? But he was also happy to be getting attention from her, finally. But now that he was here he felt like he shouldn't be here. Her attention was enough, he shouldn't be taking anything else.</p>
<p>As he was thinking this, she asked him out of the blue “Does your wife mind you sitting and talking to a young woman like this late at night in a hotel room?” The way she said 'wife' sounded like a snigger, like she poking fun at him for being married. For all the time he had spent with his wife, all the hard and triumphant times that they had stepped through.</p>
<p>“I'm not doing anything though” he said. Disappointed to be reminded of her. “Besides, it's just talking, she won't mind”</p>
<p>“Yes, but is this talking?” she said. She leaned forward and kissed him. He felt shy and worried, but on the surface he was strong.</p>
<p>He had the strength to pull away, but not to verbally resist her. </p>
<p>“You know that you can do anything to me and I won't mind, I'll love you to do anything.” she said. Suddenly her voice was seductive, and he wasn't sure if she was putting on an act, or was this just the way she talked always? </p>
<p>Was he going to fall to her temptations? He felt like the Great Wall or one of those, being made with noble and grand intentions, but he was beginning to crumble, not one brick at a time, but thousands and millions of bricks falling out into a deep nothingness below. It was a recurring dream he had all the time about all the people he met in his life.</p>
<p>Three hours earlier, the sun was up. People were standing around and doing things. Everyone was talking to each other normally. In this normality, one of the employees in the retail store who shall not be named, was working as usual. Today he had gelled his hair up with a special hair product. Perhaps it was because of this reason, or else it could have been the top button that he had undone to reveal a little more of himself.</p>
<p>To be honest, at the same time, the clandestine heist meeting was taking place in the bar. Amongst the customers and a few employees drinking and doing things, these few were planning the huge heist. </p>
<p>The employee left the store briefly to take out the rubbish. When he did so he saw one of the recent customers. A journalist woman travelling with a large group fo tourists. Last night, near closing time she ahd come in and asked about the activities, then she said she wished to see him today, she wanted to see him. Her friend told them that she was tipsy, and was looking to have some fun. Right now he saw that there were about five others looking around and talking to her. As he passed by them with the rubbish cart he saw her see him. He just walked past, there was no way she would notice him. He was just a loser taking out the rubbish. He threw out the rubbish with viguor and some kind of energy, he didn't know where it came from. He was already tired of working day in and day out. He kenw he should maintain a good attitude, because it was polite, but he was getting tired of even thinking of that.</p>
<p>Then on his way back, the journalist lady who texted to meet came up to him. He had forgotten about her briefly. But he looked down and saw her skirt had a long slit, and her skin was smooth. Her leg looked like a chicken bone, and he was hungry. It was a noisy night tonight, a lot of guests were around, his colleagues were working hard. She got his number, or he got hers, they were both unclear, but it was clear what she wanted. She told him to come 'prepared'. And he knew what that meant.</p>
<p>He felt a bit guilty for sneaking out, but he had to. Because the world was bigger than their work. There was more respect than what was just there. And in his life, he didn't know it, but he only looked for respect.</p>
<p>When he got to the room, she texted him he saw a new woman open the door. It was the same woman, but she had changed again, and her hair was prepared so that she looked like a new woman with a fruit salad. She slid her arm over the doorknob and dragged him in. She had obviously dressed up, tight top, flowery dress, short, and high heels. She bought them all from the store earlier. And it was a bit embarrassing for him to think that, but it was surprising to think that she would dress up for him. “Oh, I dress up for everyone” she said, her tone was matter-of-fact, and there was nothing special in it. “I just need to feel fresh”</p>
<p>Maybe it was a journalist thing, he shrugged and took it. She had shopping bags littered around the room, they were full of things, one had a half used toothpaste tube, another had a box of beers, a grey plastic bag half under the bed had an opened bag of chips and an opened bag of chips. It didn't matter, compared to her character the place was a mess. In his mind it was a conflict, was this woman messy, or was she tidy. Just the contradiciton was enough to confuse him immensely.</p>
<p>He realized that he hadn't even seen a store in a long time. These shopping bags were new things for her. “What is all of this?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it's just stuff, I need to see it everywhere to feel calm” she smiled, “It's kind of weird isn't it” It was weird, but he was fine with that. He looked around and saw how everyone was doing things. He wanted to get to know her better. Maybe it was just a journalist thing.</p>
<p>She was a guest of the hotel, and it was different to see the way she acted. On that day they organized for her to help them, another member. </p>
<p>“Why did you come to the hotel, did you come as a tourist or a journalist?” He asked her as the necklace was handed to him and he placed it carefully on the bedside table.</p>
<p>“I'm here as a journalist” she said. She took off her earrings and handed them to him as well. He took them delicately with the touch of a naiive young man and put them beside the necklace.</p>
<p>“No, no” she shook her finger, “Not on the table, it will ruin the wood, see?” She lifted the earrings up and showed him a scar in the wood. It was a type of thing that only she would see. </p>
<p>“What are you writing about here?” he said, as she moved to the side. </p>
<p>“Okay, fine, there's a heist” she said, “They called me in to report on it”</p>
<p>“A heist?”</p>
<p>“A stealing, there's some thieves disguised, they're stealing something highly valuable”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” she said, “Something valuable”</p>
<p>Actually, she didn't care about what they were stealing, she just wanted someone to keep her company through the night. The handsome porter cuddled her. But afterwards, when the morning came, she rolled over in the covers and took his arm off her. She walked over to the curtains and opened them. It was still dark, the first signs of sunshine were breaking through the long cave they had been trapped in. </p>
<p>Later she reported on the porter that he stole something from her when he came to deliver something, because she felt so guilty about the whole exchange. The porter was walking to reception with a powerful gait, he felt strong and loved, like hecould conquer anything. Then a hand was held out in front of the access gate and he was stopped.</p>
<p>His boss, whatever his name was, had a badge, and a firm expression on. The boss only wore his badge when he was serious, and his firm expression when he was really serious. “Did you steal a watch off a customer at the hotel?” </p>
<p>“No” The porter was shocked, where had this come from. His slick young hair was torn back like origami paper. “I have no idea what you're talking about”</p>
<p>The boss shook his head and waved his finger. “Come with me, I'm a happy man most of the time, you know I am, but right now I'm not, right?”</p>
<p>The porter walked into the office and saw her sitting there. The journalist, she wasn't looking at him, she was examining a painting on the wall with her legs crossed. She was wearing the same clothes he saw her in this morning. When she finally looked, she had a very disproportionately dissatisfied expression on.</p>
<p>The porter was punished, but later on he got a text from her saying she wanted to apologize. He was so confused, he went over in the afternoon, in normal casual clothes. They went at it again, then afterwards he was asleep in the bed with an orange glow of the light. She sat next to him and smoked, the covers were sprawled everywhere like tissue paper after a bad cold. </p>
<p>She felt like it, so she ordered room service. The porter had been crying like a baby, for some reason while doing it he broke down and cried. She comforted him, and it made her feel old.</p>
<p>She found a bottle of wine and some chips in the menu and ordered room service. She looked down and saw a hand on the menu, and on her hand on the phone. It was the porter, she looked over to see him awake and leaning over, stopping her from calling. His eyes glared at her like a butterfly. </p>
<p>She called anyway, within five minutes there was a knock at the door. The porter felt so bad, his colleague was going to come up and give it to her. She knew this, but didn't she care? Didn't she know this was bad for him?</p>
<p>Then it hit him, as he was crawled over in the bed covers like an unopened bottle of wine, he realized that she actually didn't care, she could easily find some other guy, he was replaceable. He looked at her, the figure of her success, the wisdom of her ways that came with age, the dexterity of her actions; and he knew he shouldn't feel bad because he felt the same way about her as well. His girlfriend of two years. They were both replaceable to each other, yet so necessary and inevitable and planned by fate.</p>
<p>As he walked home he saw shadows on the other side of glass. Walking past, from tour bus, to the next place. The building on his right was the water tank, inside was a deep reservoir of water that flowed out into the pipes. There were no lights inside, and only a cleaner checked it by himself, no one knew, but it was very dark green colour, in order not to stand out from the environment, every now and then when it rained the water inside bellowed like a loud drum, and the top floors of the hotel and a few residents nearby could hear it. They voiced complaints, and the hotel promised to move the building, but this was never fully approved.</p>
<p>From the top floor, looking down the hotel, the lower floors stuck out like roofs. At one part a pipe was bronze and sticking out from stone, like a factory taking place. It was actually the reception, but they didn't know that from here.</p>
<p>The sun was like a crack in the window. A couple were standing and reaching out to it with their eyes. The man looked at his woman like she was an old bag. He took her for granted and kept walking around her. Unbeknowest to him she was an eccentric and highly original woman. She had  recently made something important in the world, but he didn't know that and treated her differently because of it. If he knew that he would never let her go. She was a very imaginative woman, she said the stairs of the hotel led to heaven, and back down to earth below and gave him a choice to go in either direction. “Which way do you want to go?” She grinned with a cheeky smile, her head was tilting and she played with the railing like a little girl. “These stairs are for special places but no one knows that these are the stairs for it.” And then she kept repeating how beautiful it was here, how she was going to miss it. Even though they were on vacation together, she didn't seem to see him.</p>
<p>The sun was like a stove in the room, cooking them all and making them ripe. And he knew what she was saying, but didn't know why, or how she got the passion and ideas to say such things. It was like she was living in a specialized world of her own. In this world she dressed and walked and talked a certain way. The longer he watched her in this world the more he wanted to join her there as well.</p>
<p>Then, as it was shining, it was raining outside, the windows flocked up with flowing scales, like a curtain. They couldn't do anything, like a screen was blocking the world from view.</p>
<p>He went over to an empty piano, it was sitting against the wall like furniture. He opened it up and brushed it, he blew over it like it was a device. He started playing quietly, it was a tune from somewhere in his mind, from someplace long ago and incredibly far away. She silently brought up a stool and aligned it next to him. She would listen to him play the piano, but she wouldn't do anything about it. She wouldn't say anything because the piano was the one that wanted to be heard and not talked to, or talked about. That was the ambiguity of it.</p>
<p>Another woman stood next to them. She was listening to the music with her arms crossed. She stood like she was bored, she was about thirty, their age. The man asked her where she was from, she said an island, but it wasn't actually that island, that wasn't good. The man then asked her what she did in the country, and she said she wasn't from that country, she was from the island. And he wondered where that island even was...Then he realized that he might not be able to go there, what if the heist and dangerous risky mission didn't work out.</p>
<p>The man was Mr. Melancholy. He was with one of his recent women, she had turned back to look out at the mountains with this guest. After the piano stopped playing the hotel guest asked Mr. Melancholy if he ever got bored looking at these same mountains all the time. </p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy moved his hands over the keys, then he said that he never became bored, he stayed interested all the time. She was just killing time, rolling questions around on her tongue like they were fire, there was another half an hour until dinner, and all her friends would come down. Things were boring for her right now. Meanwhile, he was trying to buy time, as much time as possible before the heist, because after it started, everything would change.</p>
<p>Forty Seven.5:</p>
<p>Mr. Angry was sweeping up a room when he came up with a new idea. Last night there was a staff party, some people who got off work at midnight were drinking. They were beginning to get loud and noisy, the sanity was disappearing, and the music kept getting turned up louder. Next to the party rooms were staff rooms, members who were trying to sleep and stay alive. Other people kept coming around and telling them things. When it got too loud, the first level was the night porter, she walked in and told everyone to be quiet. If the party still went on after she left, the next level of warning was the administration ladies. These were three ladies with the same half moon shaped glasses and narrow waists. It never went past them, but if it did, then the final level was the GM himself who would come to reprimand the staff members. If they wanted to talk to the boss another way was to force them to come out by waking them up all the time at night. It wouldn't be a good attitude, but at least some part of the security on the top floor would be reduced. And when the GM was out of his room they could sneak in up the elevator to go to her.</p>
<p>That night Mr. Lazy came into the room with Mr. Purple. She was wearing the same clothing, the clothes she always wore, it was her uniform. but the thought of them being here together made him excited. </p>
<p>They sat down on the bed without a word, it was all so slow. They looked at each other carefully and reacted to each other's movement. And she responded approvingly. But he noticed something slightly different, maybe it was the way she carried herself. Was she a fraction of a hair's amount more quiet? If that strand of hair wasn't brushing over her cheek in that way he wouldn't suspect anything, but it was, and it bugged him. Was she a fraction of a hair's amount more reactive and enjoying it? It was so incredibly subtle that he wasn't sure, so he tried again. He made the same movements and gestures. She looked back at him once, twice, a quick glance followed by a roll up.</p>
<p>“You're trying to guess aren't you” she said. Usually she wouldn't' say this, usually she never said what she was thinking because she was afraid. “How deep is my love?” she said, “In today's episode, will Jason be able to guess?” “Choose one” she held out a finger and put it on the left side of the bed, Very sour, or, she put her finger in the middle of the bed, medium deep, or she put her finger on the right, next to his toes, very sweet.</p>
<p>It was like he had activated some part of her that came out, like when you pressed one of those buttons on a vending machine.</p>
<p>“Very sweet” he said.</p>
<p>“Good choice” she smiled.</p>
<p>“Is it the right choice?” he said, not knowing if she, or anyone, knew what 'right' was.
“The man who told me to do this with you told me the man who chose that would be right for me” She immediately held her mouth, like it was something she was not meant to say.</p>
<p>“Someone told you to date me? Is it your father?” Did that mean that all of this wasn't deliberate.</p>
<p>“Something like that” she paused and nodded and took off her pants.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” he said. “Are you only here because someone asked you to?”</p>
<p>“Do I still have to answer if I'm taking off my pants? Aren't you distracted?”</p>
<p>“I'm very distracted” he said, leaning over and running his hands over her legs. “But I'm also so curious about you, you're mysterious”</p>
<p>She reached over and silenced him, “Then what are you waiting for?” Her tone was demanding, she looked at him like a tool that was disobeying her, “Ravish me, you're a man right?” </p>
<p>And the rest of the night was a fairytale and a nightmare for the neighbours.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy gulped in the bed, next door the porter and the journalist were starting up again, the engine was full of gas and the screaming pierced the walls like those loud inconsiderate motorcycles on the freeway in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple suddenly arched her back, her eyes widened, “That's the sound” she said, she reached down and grabbed Mr. Lazy's nuts. He winced.</p>
<p>“What sound?” </p>
<p>She looked up from her place down next to his privates, everywhere she looked there was a dick in front of her. “It's the sound I keep hearing in my dream. I can't believe I've found it here”</p>
<p>She grew happier and happier until she was floating over the ground. People everywhere looked at her, it was uncommon for someone to be so happy in such a normal place.</p>
<p>“See, now it's not just talking anymore is it?”</p>
<p>She changed her expressions suddenly, she was moody. Mr. Lazy coudln't help but be intrigued, she was an amazing woman, especially for him, he had only been with one woman all his life and the curiosity was killing him. What was beneath her black dress, it was so slim, and the halter top ran down exposing the tops of her fruits. He kept looking at her and looking away. Her presence was demanding, she yearned for his attention. He  looked at her and looked away. </p>
<p>“Who are you kidding? Just go for it” she said in a small voice that could barely be heard over the chorus of joy next door. “You can do anything you like to me” </p>
<p>He looked down, her hands were on his balls, squeezing and releasing, like she was testing the fruit in the supermarket to see if it was ripe. How could he answer properly. He could just reach out and touch her breasts, lick her until she was moaning in ecstasy, it was all right there, and no one had to know.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple came over. “It's a paradox isn't it, if you touch me, here, or here” she ran her fingers over her body, combing through the slender curtain. “And what if you don't touch me you say? You might regret it for the rest of your life. You might wake up one morning and groan in frustration because you wished that one time here you had touched me, what if you had done it? You'll be wondering it all the time. So just give up and touch me.”</p>
<p>He sighed, “I'm so conflicted” he said, “This is so wrong, but it still feels so right, to be here with you”</p>
<p>She grinned like she had heard it before, almost as if she knew what he was saying. Men, when in these circumstances probably always said this kind of thing. Then he wondered if it was worth it to lose his marriage to a woman like this who didn't think of him importantly. </p>
<p>He sat down on the bed while she slowly meandered to him like a flat river that was in no rush to go back to the sea. She sat down beside Mr. Lazy, he had his legs wide and had his elbows resting on his knees, grasping his chin.“I'm a moral man, I promised my wife I would never cheat”</p>
<p>“We all make that promise” Mr. Purple said. “Everyone does at some stage of their life”</p>
<p>“Have you made the promise?”</p>
<p>She didn't answer, “It's your choice, it's up to you what your morals say. But not many people live by morals anymore, and all of your friends, the other guys have cheated, it's a normal thing. Don't worry about it, you're doing good, you did really well at today's meeting. If you do stick to those high morals, people will respect you, especially your wife, because no one does it, and it will show a strength of character. But do you really care for that? My own opinion is that it's not that important.”</p>
<p>“You act like you know me and what I am doing, like I'm doing it for you? Who are you anyway? Get lost”</p>
<p>His sharp disrespectful tone was supposed to push her away, but his firmness aggravated her. She wanted to melt onto him. Such a loyal man like him really got her excited, she wanted to conquer him and bend him to fit her. He was a challenge she needed to change.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me so bad, even after I refuse?” he said, “Can't you respect someone's marriage? By doing this you're hurting a lot more than my wife, you're hurting me, and disrespecting yourself.”</p>
<p>Next door the screaming became stronger, the woman was nearign climax, she sounded like a heavy portion of rain was hitting a tin roof. Or a train that was clanging past on a rough surface.</p>
<p>“You know, they designed this hotel with all the rooms soundproof, but only this floor had its plans changed.” Mr. Purple said. She had stood up and was undoing her dress, it slowly fell to the ground beneath her, wrapping her feet in warm moisture. Her back was bare and had beads of sweat in the right places, giving out the scent of a woman. If they were in different places, perhaps it would be a scent of a different creature, more blessed, or less blessed. But overall this was their reaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy didn't dare look up, she was too sexy, if he looked any longer he really wouldn't be able to hold back. No man could resist a woman, but especially not a woman like her.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple covered her breasts and slowly turned around. “Why do you think the rooms directly next to the GM's room have not been soundproofed? Hmm?” She sounded like a child who was curiously asking an innocent question.</p>
<p>“Because he wanted some sort of transparency, just on his floor, if I designed it I would do the same” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>She smiled with her crimson lips and layered more make-up on in front of him, “No, it's because he wanted to, that's all” (Need a better reason for this, something more innocent and simple, which makes it unexpected and funny)</p>
<p>“Let's talk about something else other than anything even mildly related to the heist.” Mr. Lazy said, “Where do you work? Are you part of this hotel? How come everyone seems to know you, but no-one in the hotel does.” As soon as he looked up he regretted it, she was looking at the picture on the wall, her head tilted slightly to the left, her jawline was convincing. She noticed him looking and smiled back. It was clear she wasn't listening. Even while with him, he was still in his own world.</p>
<p>“It's not that bad of a thing you know, it feels like all the rooms are closer and connected, there's less strangers”</p>
<p>“You're the most quiet person, what would you know about strangers, you always stand in the corner and scoff at us, like you're better than us. It's like you're watching a TV screen and just laughing at us”</p>
<p>She turned around, cupping her breasts with slender hands and fingers. “That's not true, I'm naked before you, so you have to believe everything that I say now”. She put a finger on his nose and dipped it in her mouth, then wiped it on his nose again. “Look, I just want to fit in, I have so many friends and people who admire and respect me, but I don't feel satisfied by them.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a first world problem”</p>
<p>She shrugged “My hypothesis...”</p>
<p>“yeah”</p>
<p>“My hypothesis is that the GM actually is a huge pervert, and he wants to hear all the noises happening around him, all the animalistic sounds of humans, it's like he's in a zoo every night when people start getting together. That's why the honeymoon suite is ont his floor and everything else, right beneath the Egyptian Jewellery floor”</p>
<p>He was stunned, she fleeted around topics so quick, could she be trusted? Was this how she treated her men as well?</p>
<p>“If you see anyone dressed like this” she said, “They're an idiot, you'll know that because they'll be dressed like this”
“So your'e saying you're a fool?”
“Yes” she nodded with her whole head, like one fo those bumpy thigns on the car. “U'm a fool”</p>
<p>“If I had a superpower, it would be teleportation” she said. “How about you?”</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy was still panting. “I don't know, maybe something stupid, like blindness?”</p>
<p>“Stupid? How is that stupid?”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop pretending to be a fool or stupid or all pure or whatever, just say what you're thinking, I'm sick of your games”</p>
<p>“I can't talk normally, properly, I can't hold a conversation” she said. Suddenly she was vulnerable. He wasn't sure how long this would last with her. “I try to hold a conversation all the time, but it gets boring for them, or I keep thinking about other things, like a sparrow in search of food. Either I get boring for them, or they get boring for me. Boredom's all around the corner.”</p>
<p>“If I'm blind” he said, “I don't need to see you and I won't be tempted”</p>
<p>“No” she said, “I described my weaknesses because you wanted to hear them, now you need to say something back to me”</p>
<p>“My weakness” Mr. Lazy said, saying what came to his mind directly and piercingly. “Is that I'm still in love with my wife, I'm married”</p>
<p>“I went up to the jewellery room, and I have been with the GM” she said.</p>
<p>“Yeah whatever” Mr. Lazy stood up, he held his bag up, then left. “I'm not going to cheat, I lvoe my wife, and even if I didn't, it's a moral code of conduct”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple smiled, “Good, I respect you for that” she waved like a well oiled machine, “I will see you tomorrow” It wasn't a friendly wave, and it wasn't unfriendly, it was just there, without much meaning.</p>
<p>Afetr she left Mr. Lazy sat for a while on the bed. He felt something but he wasn't sure what. Was this anger or was it disappointment? If it was, then at who?  Why was he feeling this way. He reached out to the bed cloth on his right which lay crumpled like a nacho. The sheet was still warm, and he couldn't believe that just moments ago Mr. Lady Purple had been there. She sat in the room as if it were her furniture and commanded his attention like he was something she bought and discarded from a supermarket. It was beyond his understanding.</p>
<p>And he thought of Laura sitting on their old couch at home, she was looking into the distance, wondering when he would come home. She trusted him fully, even when he was tempted away from her. </p>
<p>He finally stood up and checked the room to make sure they had left nothing. Then he went outside and into the corridor. He felt guiltier than every other man as he put his shoes on, and when he tied his laces he felt like someone lower than chewing gum. His laces felt like they should be around his neck and strangling him into pulp.</p>
<p>He closed the door gently behind him. </p>
<p>“Don't you have any dignity to treat yourself a little better?” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple had a nasty look when she looked back, “What is with you men judging how I live my life, it's none of your business, if you want me to treat myself better, why don't you respect my choices? You keep chaining women around you down, maybe that's why you're so depressed and miserable”</p>
<p>She immediately regretted saying it, if she had just kept silent then they would never confront this. That was way over the line, the line was way back there, so far back that you couldn't see it anymore. </p>
<p>“I'm depressed and miserable?” Mr. Lazy said. “Is that how you think of me?” </p>
<p>“No” she said, “I didn't mean that”</p>
<p>Afterwards Mr. Lazy went to his wife. It was really as he pictured it, the house was normal, so normal that nothing had changed. The table and furniture was in the same place, and Laura was lying down and reading an article of something. It was boring to look at, it was always the same, and it suddenly made sense to him why he had ventured to Mr. Purple so long ago when he first saw her. She was just another woman, but each time he saw her his curiosity and fascination of her deepened and he became less bored with what he had.</p>
<p>He looked outside the window, the curtains were drawn carefully and they were tied. The flowers had been freshened up, and the stove was still hot. Laura had probably gone out to do something with her friends. To her it was a normal day, but for him, he could smell the scent of her everywhere, see the aftermath of her actions in the house and everywhere he looked. For her tomorrow was just another day, she would repeat the same actions again and again for the length of a life. But tomorrow he didn't have that luxury.</p>
<p>He became really nervous, as he stood there the sun dipped and the stove cooled down, it was becoming dark and the children playing outside returned home. He sat there in the dark and slowly questioned himself. What was he doing here, why was he doing this? What possible benefit would it bring to them. Was he doing this for himself, or for them?</p>
<p>When Laura came home she found Jason sitting calmly at the table with his hands empty. It was something she recognized, she had known him long enough to see his panic attacks. Maybe for the last few hours he had been sitting and breathing heavily. It was when he really needed someone there for him.</p>
<p>“What's wrong?” She said, she dropped the shopping bags onto the ground and rushed over to her husband, she got closer and heard him wheezing. “What's wrong, what's wrong, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I'm really nervous” he said, finally. Hugging her back.</p>
<p>“I know” she said, “It's obvious, you're always like this. What is it this time, suddenly you want to buy an expensive car and are afraid of telling me?” She remembered the past times he was hyperventilating, they were things they had overcome together and had ripened with fondness “Or did you suddenly remember something urgent that you forgot to do? Or are you suddenly stressed about life and all the things you have to do, or could do?”</p>
<p>“Before I tell you” he had calmed down a lot now, “Will you give me your blessing?”</p>
<p>“Blessing?” she said, “You mean how I always give it to you?” She sang him a short song that they both knew. But when she finished she saw that instead of calming him, more short stubby tears had formed in his eyes like snowflakes in the early morning. Maybe it was more serious than she thought.</p>
<p>“What is it?” she said, “What do you want me to do, is there something you need to tell me?” She turned her hand back to the shopping bags and started to sort out the items like she always did, integrating back to her normal life. Jason looked up at her through his tears, it wasn't even painful anymore, this would ruin their normal life, it wasn't like those other times, this was different, he knew it.</p>
<p>“You haven't cried in a long time” She said, putting some carrots and broccoli away and wiping the tears off his eyes and onto her sleeve.</p>
<p>“I'm part of a heist” he said.</p>
<p>“Like stealing?” She sniffed, “Is this for a staff party, and you don't know what to wear?”</p>
<p>“Like life or death” Jason said, “It's a serious mission, and I don't know if I will still come back home”</p>
<p>Now, finally she got it. The food she was holding fell to the carpet, etching a mark into it. “You're what?” she said, she grabbed his shoulders and stared him straight on, they were both crouched on the ground now. “Is it dangerous?”</p>
<p>Jason nodded, “It's extremely dangerous, I knew it was but I still joined, am I an idiot or what?” He tried to laugh but she didn't budge. Now he wasn't the only one crying, a slow droplet formed at the bottom of her left eyelid and made its way down her cheek at a quarter of a kilometer per hour. “That's why can I have your blessing?”</p>
<p>“Why do you want it? You're going to go anyway right?” She moved away from him, the reality of it was sinking in and she felt betrayed. He knowingly joined this thing after knowing that he might not come back, that he might leave her alone and stranded. And he still chose this? Was it her? Did she do something to displease him? </p>
<p>But he had more tears in his eyes that she hadn't noticed earlier and when she saw those, she began to feel guilty. It was crazy, she never usually felt guilty about anything. The last time was high school “I didn't feel bad about it in the first place, but when you say it like that it makes me feel bad, so stop it okay? I didn't feel bad, but now I do.”</p>
<p>He tried to dry his tears, he had become a little boy helpless without his mother.</p>
<p>She sighed, things had escalated so quickly from when she was shopping. She was just going to cook a normal meal and have a normal dinner with him. “I give you my blessing, I don't want you to do this, but do your best now that you're doing it okay? I'm going to turn my head for one day, then when I look back you have to promise me you'll be fine, okay? And then we won't have to talk about this, what you're going through, what we're going through together. Shhh Shhh” She hugged him tightly, felt the sweat of his shirt against her, his chest was heaving onto hers, unable to carry its weight. “I don't want to give you my blessing, but I will”</p>
<p>“If I come back” he was trembling, the tips of his fingers, “You're going to be here right? You're not going to go anywhere and leave me alone”</p>
<p>She was startled to think that he was going through all this. “Of course I'll be here. Don't worry. I'll always always be here for you”</p>
<p>“I can't go without your blessing, it's like I feel everything will go wrong if you don't approve of me, I'm not going to come back, or something's going to horribly wrong, it's just how I feel”</p>
<p>“It's not just how you feel” she put her hand on his shoulder and rubbed it up and down. “It's something more powerful out there, a higher power that is dissuading you.” Then she moved her hair back and lay her weary head on his shoulder. It was strong and supportive. “You know you have my blessing. It's against everything I believe in and was raised to support, but I'm doing this, and it's for you. When you come back, I promise I'll be here on this bed, lying like this naked under the covers. And I'll be waiting for you to come and rip them off me, so please, please do so.”</p>
<p>He knew that what she meant by please, wasn't lust, it had nothing to do with it, she wanted him to come back safely, that's all she wanted. But by saying this she thinks she can maybe hide it and get the same result. She doesn't dare admit it to herself either, that this is dangerous work, and her husband will likely not come back alive. And if he comes back, it would be as a criminal.</p>
<p>“What if I don't come back?” he said. “What will happen?”</p>
<p>“We'll think about that if it happens” she said. “Just stay postivie okay?” Shr thought about it, “Just how dangerous is this really?”</p>
<p>“If I'm lucky I could be killed” he said. “To be honest.”</p>
<p>In the morning she heard him stir on the bed and moved to wake up. He was getting dressed the same as usual and took his belongings through but he took a bag with him. She went to talk to him, but when he departed it was like she doesn't matter to him anymore, “I'm going” Like his mood had suddenly changed. It left her confused.</p>
<p>“Wait” she looks up, knowing this is the moment he is going to change, “Is that all?”</p>
<p>“What? You're fine right? I'm fine as well” he said.</p>
<p>“Okay, come here and hug me” she said. It was very normal for the amount of thought that was bypassing her system. She didn't know how she sounded so calm and cool in a constant state of stress.</p>
<p>He looked at her calmly, he eventually came over and hugged her but only because she asked him to. She had no idea what he was thinking about, she thought she knew him but now she wasn't so sure. At night he was needy, insecure and weak, but during the day he was a strong and confident man who ignored her advances. She fell in love with only one of these men, she never knew there were two. But it was hard to manage the big change. And now in this crucial moment she felt like she didn't know who he was.</p>
<p>She didn't want to give in, and he didn't either, it was a taciturn power play, a battle between who was able to reject the other first, who was stronger; and the weaker more emotional one was the loser. </p>
<p>Jason's friend heard this about them, he was an effeminate man, a feminine thinker, and being highly socially perceptive he said “That's not nice, a relationship shouldn't be like that, it should be showing love, love is your gift to each other, not the weakness that you have to hide. Why are we competing in this? Where did this competition butt its ugly head in from?” They had been married for years, had it slowly grown into the wedge between them and expanded itself as they went about their daily activities? Or had it arisen suddenly as a result of something more profound.</p>
<p>And Jason, who was in love with her, she was so perfect, she was amazing and incredible, but when his friend said this he inadvertently agreed with her as well. And he saw how he had been blinded, and she has been blinded. Why are they in this kind of relationship? Was it because of her character? Or was it because of his character? Or was it something in the air?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven6-mr-angry">forty seven.6: Mr. Angry</h3>
<p>Mr. Angry was looking over the security with a certain fondness. He liked what he saw and he was really interested. But the longer he looked, the more uncertain he became. It was always different what people thought, and he was never sure.</p>
<p>While he stood around he started a conversation with one of the employees who worked at the bar, and another guy who worked on one of the tours. They just started a random conversation about deep topics, it was one of those moments where you treasured the people around you.</p>
<p>There were cameras everywhere, in the past years a lot more security had been added to the hotel.  People stole things everywhere in the world, and in such a serene and beautiful fairytale-like location it seemed absurd that humans were here. Even in this isolation humans and their ways followed, artificial systems were constructed in the midst of chaotic nature. Compassion and confidence were instilled in the most superficial of things, and meaning was formed from the most arbitrary belongings. It showed a state of anxiety with the world or at least in this small world. In most places there were three cameras directed at everything and people were always doing something under them.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry went to the bathroom. He shoved himself into a bathroom cubicle and smoked, his legs cramped up, hearing sounds all around him. He had ten minutes of break, and when he looked down at his watch it was time to go back. He rubbed the cigarette against the rim of the toilet, letting the dust settle to the floor like some putrid artificial rain.</p>
<p>“Do you want to change your name?” Mr. Chatterbox said. When he came out. It was Annalise from reception, and she shouldn't be talking to him so casually in front of everyone.</p>
<p>“I'm going to labour” Mr. Angry said, “Until people change my name for me, I'm not going to change it myself. I want them to call me genius. And then I can stop with it all.” He gritted his teeth and spoke.</p>
<p>His answer was absurd in its depth for such a normal place, but he kept it going nevertheless. He knew she was just asking a plain question, but that didn't stop him from answering seriously.</p>
<p>Annalise walked with him, he just looked beside himself and she was there. Keeping pace and holding paperwork as an excuse. “This is pretty much the last day right?”</p>
<p>He looked up at the cameras, the GM was watching, and he might be able to lip read what she was saying. Mr. Angry turned his back to the camera and stood in front of Annalise, he was probably overthinking but it was better to be on the safe side. He knew his eye changed everything, if he missed a detail someone might die, if he made a wrong decision, he might be in jail for the rest of his life. This fortune was not something to come by easily.</p>
<p>He recently obtained a map of the locations of all of the security cameras, it was from the designers, who installed them three years ago. Since then he knew the GM had bought two more for himself and installed them, one in his own office and one in front of his door where he was supposed to be.</p>
<p>The cameras were reinforcing the concept of always being watched. There was a quiet person always watching you wherever you were. The employees were always surrounded by people, if you took one route instead of the other, someone was watching and wondering why, or if you said one word extra, or less. Why did you use that word. Or the speed at which you walked, or which direction you looked in, these things were closely scrutinized until things had become unclear for everyone. The GM sometimes walked around and reminded people of how he was watching the cameras. At the end of the day the different departments took their money back after counting it and matching it to the numbers it was supposed to be. The Big boss watched as the employees counted every penny. He watched as the computer screen shone upon his face like an artificial light, highlighting his wrinkles from years of proving himself and heightening his skillset and moving up in the world. The GM liked it this way, by turning all of the lights off and focusing on the computer screen he was able to identify things that otherwise coudln't be found. Even when there were security cameras up people still loosened and acted the way they would.</p>
<p>The money that was counted continued down the river and went straight to the safe. At the end of every week it was transferred to the bank after a big armored car with nuclear missiles came through. This was all a big secret kept between the manager of reception and the GM, otherwise no one really thought about where the cash went.</p>
<p>The Boss, Black came to the counter when there were no customers, he had just finished an important phone call and was coming back here. But on the way he needed to tell the employees that one of their members was leaving.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Elizabeth asked, her hands edged onto the counter, her fingers gripping it. “I didn't know about this”</p>
<p>Black looked at William, he didn't say anything, and everyone knew.</p>
<p>“You didnt' tell us?” Elizabeth looked him up and down like he was a fish. “How come you didn't say anything?” She looked offended, this whole time he hadn't said anything to her. Even when she talked to hima nd cared for him like her own child. She felt a bit betrayed by his lack of a response, and it showed her clearly that he didn't care about this job, or her efforts in helping him learn the ropes.</p>
<p>“You're leaving...” William's colleague said, he patted him on the shoulder in front of the boss, as a gesture to show he was a team player and respected other peoples' privacy. The boss saw it and got the message. </p>
<p>“Look hgow many people are saddened” Black said, his face was so expression less that it was difficult to tell if he was serious or sarcastic. Or whether he was just saying another speech that came up when an employee left the premises. He followed a formula, two days before, hint at it, then on the day, inform everyone. The employee would usually leave in a week.</p>
<p>But then unexpectedly, after a few hours and the news spread (because it always does in this place), other things happened and more and more people appeared and came along, etc. They told him he would be sorely missed.</p>
<p>On this day, in the store, it was shown on one of the security cameras. The GM was walking past and wishing one of the employees well. She had resigned from her job, her reasons were vague, it 'wasn't for her', or she 'wasn't able to develop personally and professionally in the directions she was hoping', that sort of thing. Jargon that didn't mean much to anyone. But the GM made it a personal mission to see to it that employees past present and future were treated well. He tried to wish everyone the best whenever they came past.</p>
<p>The girl's colleagues were working normally, but if they took a break for five minutes they would become teary holding tissues against their eyes. It was a sappy atmosphere, the store had turned into a swamp. Word had spread that the girl was leaving and other things happened and more people appeared and came along. They told her she would be loved. “Goodbye” they helped her out with her suitcase, inside it were presents and memories from all the people around here. The girl had worked in the store for so long with complaints on her mind, but now that she was leaving she suddenly felt regretful, what if she could stay a bit longer?</p>
<p>William saw all of this, he saw her suitcase being helped along, and the girl become so popular all of a sudden. This girl was always popular, everyone tried to be friends with her, they asked if she was okay when she was sick and brought food to her. When there was a party she was on the side, but always surrounded by guys. </p>
<p>Halfway out the door, the girl stopped walking and talking and greeting all of those who had come to say goodbye. She had made quite a name for herself in this microsystem. She was crying. She felt so bad that she had to cry, she felt embarrassed, but the insincerity of not crying had grown too great. They didn't know why she cried. Shouldn't she be happy to be moving somewhere more appropriate? </p>
<p>But it was also because she was waiting for someone. As she stood at the doorway to leave, the bus was pulling in behind her, and everyone was guiding her onto it with chbeery faces. She swallowed her tears and stood there surrounded by people, swarms of them. Suddenly she hated all of these people and the popularity she had garnered. She only wanted to see him. </p>
<p>As she stood there he finally appeared, he saw her and stopped running up the hill, he leant down with his hands on his knees and panted. Then he looked up at her standing surrounded by a whoel lot of bustling smiling people, her hair curled in the wind and she stood at the top of the hill with a bus behind her. Everything else was bare. His heart was still beating fast. She saw him from far away and the tears welled up again. She cried even harder, because she knew seeing him from this distance might be the last time she would get to see him. He still had to do this crime and pull it off. And now he regretted ever saying he would do it. He was constantly considering to stop doing it and give up now. He could just run away with her. </p>
<p>Mr. Angry saw this from the top corner, after leaving Annalise he went up the elevator to the vantage point over the roof of the hotel, and on the bare hill out back that looked like a bad shave he saw the bus waiting. The store girl was there, she was nothing special, but she was tearing up, and around her was a crowd of men. Far behind was William, standing there and looking at her. Mr. Angry observed it, he knew what William was thinking, and he knew that William wouldn't do anything about it. He turned from the scene and went down the corridor to one of the hotel rooms. Here outside one door was a spanish girl, her twin sister worked in the restaurant. She worked in housekeeping because she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend who was also working here. And he fixated on her like a baby on a lollipop, or a boy on a new toy, or a teenager on a car.</p>
<p>He thought about it, for the heist instead of using Mr. Chatterbox, who was sometimes unreliable, use a only Spanish speaking waiter endemic to the area. He knew this girl was hired here with her sister, and she would agree to do it because she wanted to gain something her sister didn't have. From his observations he saw that she always talked about her sister with words of comparison and seeing who had something the other didn't have. That seemed to be a big motivation between the two of them. Chances were though, that if she easily agreed to this, she would probably also easily agree to anything else. Maybe that was what it was like in Spain. </p>
<p>On this day, Mr. Angry would see it in about eleven minutes, but a mildly beautiful woman walked in. She was a normal person, but she had the brand of mild cheese on her breast, so she was a mild beautiful woman. The others all looked. She walked in with a suitcase that looked like a tied up man on wheels. People  gave her looks, but she looked past them and into the interior of the hotel. She studied everything with a critical eye, probably from years of observation and attention to detail acquired in University.</p>
<p>The men at reception looked at her like she was a hot and steamy restaurant at the end of a long racecourse. “She's hot” the first guy said.</p>
<p>“I want to take her right here” The second guy said, he whispered it quietly because the thrid guy was on the phone, and he had a customer in front of him waiting for a check-in. </p>
<p>The third guy put his hand over the phone and nodded, then forgot that he could talk, it was a lady complaining about the heating in the room, typical. “Women like that make my day, why aren't there more women around?”</p>
<p>Behind them all, was Charlotte, she walked past and stopped. “Hey, I'm a woman”</p>
<p>The guys shrugged, “Yeah, but you've got something shoved up your butt or something, you never smile, only when you're with that guy from the store. That woman is hot, and probably available, if I try hard enough.”</p>
<p>Charlotte rolled her eyes and attended to a customer, she always had to listen to them speak about doing the nasty with random women who walked in. Sometimes it was fun, sometimes it made her feel fat. Today was the latter. The woman came up to the reception desk with a frigid smile and a freezing cold burn. Charlotte looked down, her suitcase really was weird, where did she buy it? Or was she one of those who would make it herself and be proud of the pile of shit that came out and flaunt it to everyone generously. “How can I help you?” Charlotte put on her best smile. Sometimes if you had nothing to offer, all you could do was smile.</p>
<p>In the store the eccentric and beautiful woman had caught eyes. Girlfriends shielded their boyfriends' eyes from the indecency, and men pulled their mates to watch together. Women like this were rare, there was only about a 2% chance of people like her to come through the hotel. She came to the store and waved, everyone watched her wave. Even the GM, on the security cameras was watching. They all wanted to know who she was waving to.</p>
<p>Two meters away, Misty ran forward with a big grin, her friend was here finally. “Hey how are you doing?” The two hugged and began chatting. Anyone who had a free moment checked this new girl out, they all wondered how she was in bed. They didn't know that she was the most innocent woman who wasn't looking for sex or any type of action, she was really generous and trying to be the best person she could be, they didn't see that. But they all wanted to have sex with her and pictured her in indecent ways.</p>
<p>There were a lot of business relations among the customers as well. They all did different things, and Mr. Angry watched everything. If God was the eyes of the world, the GM was the eyes in the sky, and Mr. Angry was the eyes on the ground. It was a battle of information. What they were saying was all related to it.</p>
<p>It turned out that the woman was drinking tonight. The guys all went along, there was a line into the bar, and around her table. All the bachelor's came to check her out. 5% of them had erections already. She told the men at her table that she was a tour leader and she brought customers around the world. She saw Misty once every year and a half, that's how often she circled the world, this was her fifth time already, and each time it only got more interesting. She joked about sophisticated things and said a lot of things to make people laugh. She was used to it, it was her job to take people around the world, treat them well, organize everything for them, and make them feel welcome with one another, and in the new places they were venturing into. She was the brunt of the party, and it helped that she was attractive. She had been travelling like this and attracting attention for so long that she was taking it for granted. But it also made her afraid, what happened when she wasn't so attractive anymore, like a shoe that had been polished so many times that it could no longer be polished and look the same, each time it deteriorated a bit more. Sometimes she felt herself feeling really down very suddenly, on the bus travelling between places with the customers, or even while speaking into the microphone. In the middle of the night right before bed, maybe it was something someone said, and she felt bad about it suddenly, it switched her mood right around, just one sentence or word, and she would be different for a few hours. And thinking about ageing made her feel this way more often now. She couldn't see a way out of it.</p>
<p>This woman walked upstairs to her room, after her customers ahd all been put into place and the bar was closing, behind her was a tow of a few men. But they one by one went their ways. She was always surrounded by men, she almost forgot that women existed. She could swear that people everywhere were the same, all over the world, they were defined by how long their short actions lasted. Some people would plan everything for a day, and live each day with a new plan, some people would plan their life through the unit of week. Some others would plan it by the hour, so nothing really lasted. But perhaps being with someone meant that your life became more than a short-term goal, it started lasting much longer, and the potentialities increased as well.</p>
<p>As she walked up the stairs she thought about this, and when she looked up she saw Mr. Angry descending the stairs, she looked at him like a glance she would give to anyone else. She didn't know him and he didn't know her apart from what they saw on the surface. He wasn't smiling, he wasn't even looking, he was deep in thought. She saw him and nothing changed, she looked ahead and lived in her world of tour guiding.</p>
<p>Little did she know, that at that moment, if she had stopped to talk to Mr. Angry, or if she had smiled, then he would remember her, and they would be perfect for each other. They had the same passions and hobbies and thoguht about the same things, they would have limitless things to get along together with. They woud start a relationship that qquickly grew serious, and even a flying bird that rarely touched the land, like Mr. Angry, with a messed up and antisocial mind, would land on her island. It would be a passionate romance at first, but throuhg maintenance and communication it would be maintained. But they didn't know that, they just walked past each other without any interaction, as strangers. As every other person always did.</p>
<p>She went to her room to sleep late and wake up early. Mr. Angry reached the bottom of the stairs and looked up from his thoughts to see Mr. Purple standing in front of him. </p>
<p>“I knew you'd come to me” he said, speaking first. “I was wondering when you decided to, but I knew you would”</p>
<p>She smiled, dropped her smile, and walked forward with open arms. In the open foyer they embraced like long lost friends. </p>
<p>“The whole time” he said, through the fabric of her sleeve, it tasted like HokeyPokey icecream that had coffee beans strewn through it with some sort of weird scissors. It was weird, and not in a good way. “I was thinking of that story you told”</p>
<p>“You were?” she said, “So you recognized it”</p>
<p>“I knew you were talking about that the moment you said it” he said. “It was a big part of your life”</p>
<p>“25% of my life is based on that day” she said, “If you want to be specific, like you always do”</p>
<p>The story they were talking about was when Mr. Purple talked about having confidence, or anything you wanted. But Mr. Angry's perspective was slightly different, it was different to everything else that everyone had been saying. He was the one who had told her this, when they had been dating. It was like two rocks on a quiet beach, they were always there, always changing in the same way, but because they were so inactive, they never did much together and never went anywhere. But one day a young boy came and picked them up and put them together, and then these two met each other. They were perfect for each other, the only problem was that they were too similar. There was no point dating someone who was the same as you. He was the one who told her this, and so he reocgnized the story immediately,  And he was the one who offered her everything, and he was fine with it, because he could get anything for her, and she would have confidence. That was what it meant to be in a relationship. </p>
<p>“But it's not like that, there's a bit more of it for me” he said, “It was really, different, for me.” He stood further apart from her and held his prominent jaw, accentuating his prominent jawline and prominent facial angles. “After we went our separate ways, I lost the ability to do this, for some reason I couldn't get confidence anymore. Like my body had stopped producing it or something, like the hormones in my body just screwed up and twisted themselves and went on strike and couldn't hold themselves in me anymore. It was such a strange thing, something I knew so well and was so familiar with, was gone from me. And so, I had to take it from somewhere else, I take it from the words people say, or from the actions people do to respect me, or from the praise they give me. But it wasn't enough, it was temporary and disappeared before I could get close to it, and people never give you the stuff that is richest, they hold it close to themselves. After it everything changed, like I entered a new period in my life, I couldn't do the things that pleased me previously, everything was different, I became quiet and didn't talk, and calculating....” Mr. Purple smiled, he was always like this, overthinking eveyrthing, even in his self analysis. “So I decided I had to steal it, so I started stealing confidence from somewhere else. And so I devised this plan.It's strange, sometimes the physical and ethereal things will clash together.”</p>
<p>“You know what that is?” Mr. Purple said. “I know what it is you're talking about, when you have given all your confidence to someone else.”</p>
<p>“It's a feeling? Others have experienced it? Not just me?”</p>
<p>She nodded, she understood him so completely that seeing him stressing about this was cute. He really hadn't changed at all. “It's called love.” She shook her head, “Oh no, but you don't understand it at all, you don't know how it's shaped, so you have to speak about it to give it a meaning and steal things from others to give it an action. You're not straightforward with how you're feeling, that's why your'e affecting all of us” she said,</p>
<p>He was amazed, after all these years he had changed, he had moved on to become a cold and calculated man who had gotten past love, and climbed over the tempestuous shallow feelings of life, he thought he had come to understand most of the things people saw and understood the world like a decision making machine that predicted everything. But of all things, he saw the least in himself. And this woman in front of him knew nothing much, but she interpreted him like a book, it was easy for her. </p>
<p>And, in the foyer they continued talking. The lights were dimming, the decorations that ran during the day like the water fountain had been switched off. The elevator was ready and waiting for one of them to step on, or two of them, depending on what happened next. </p>
<p>“How about you” he said. </p>
<p>“I moved on” she said.</p>
<p>“I mean, did you feel love?”</p>
<p>“No” the moment she said it his ego burst. Like a pulp had been touched.</p>
<p>“Never? Not once in the whole time?”</p>
<p>She put a finger to her lips... “Hmm, maybe once remember that time...”</p>
<p>“I went to give you an umbrella under that sack of rain?”</p>
<p>She smiled, “Yes, that time” Actually, she wasn't smiling when he looked again, he was reliving her expression that time, and he remembered how happy he had been to be able to make her smile then. Now it didn't bother him like it used to.</p>
<p>“So you have confidence? You don't feel this way like me?” Mr. Angry said, </p>
<p>“Did you forget?” she said, “You gave all of your confidence to me, remember? We even signed the contract”</p>
<p>“Then does that mean...” He didn't have to finish it, she nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p>“Yes” she stepped forward and touched the buttons on his shirt, did up his collar to make it perfect, it was just his work uniform but she perfected it. Everything in front of her was chaos, but after she touched it and walked past it, it became like a beautiful garden. “I still don't have anything in my life” she said, “Just the love you instilled in me. And that's why I'm here now, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be here” She looked around, the roof, the surroundings, to her right now they were limitless. She shook her head, “I could be...anywhere, not here”</p>
<p>“So, if you had a choice you would rather be somewhere else? You feel like you are losing to me?”</p>
<p>“I do” she smiled, “But it's not that bad, it's my choice. But it's hard to live by love, sworn by it” She smiled more, to hide what came next in an atmosphere of calm, “I need you all the time, I can't believe it, I really just can't”</p>
<p>Mr. Angry smiled, “In some ways I'm the same, I could have anything I want, but I could never find that thing that keeps us stable and able to do things, the rare thing that everyone else seems to have. In their blank looks, when they're sitting on the bus, when they're doing work, when they're talking, and when they're taking a shit, they have it, and I see it and want it.”</p>
<p>“You mean, that essence?” Mr. Purple said.</p>
<p>“No” Mr. Angry shook his head and laughed, Mr. Purple watched him and was surprised, but she didn't show it, she didn't want to show him any more strength. Why was he laughing, it wasn't even that funny. “It's something like...confidence, or self assurance” she said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so it was like I said, essence” Mr. Purple said. Eager to prove a point, but also hide herself being pleased by it.</p>
<p>“No plum, essence is always there, and you can probably grasp it and even buy it if need be, but this can't be grasped, it's just there, like something in a magazine or a complicated mathematical concept”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CHARLOTTE: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte was watching Daniel socialize with Black. She was at reception, but leaning over the counter waiting for someone to deliver something, as she did, she saw this scene and couldn't help looking for longer than she was supposed to. She knew about the heist, remember? In what seems like ages ago, William told her. He regretted it now, it was a spur of the moment thing, but he said it nonetheless. Mr. Angry was upset and socializing with Black, and Charlotte knew the two were enemies, they weren't yet, but they each represented what they hated to the other. Daniel was slack and relaxed, he never followed rules and went by life stepping on the bare minimum to keep him afloat. Black was the opposite, he had to establish control over everything around him so that his world would be predictable and free of surprises. From there he would develop his life further until it was more and more comprehensible. He didn't take big actions of risk and kept calm, slowly progressing one step at a time. The more they talked to each other the more they saw this, but after the heist it would be different.</p>
<p>Daniel was very confident, he stood calm with an arm on his hip and socialized with Black. They were both laughing, Black felt safe because Daniel was only a housekeeper, but he had a natural tendency to worry when he talked ot his superiors. He had his hands by his sides, his natural resting position in the store. It sent the message that he was open and it meant that he was free to talk.</p>
<p>Charlotte came back in afetr receiving the mail and looked down at the computer screen with room bookings and client listings. It all went past her, she saw Daniel planning something so dangerous and angry, but he was talking so nicely. He was so fake, she remembered how Daniel talked to her, he was friednly as well, and really generous. She wondered if he actually hated her as well. What if he hated everyone except himself, and his lover, it seemed like that sometimes. </p>
<p>In the store the vacuum claenr dropped, Daniel went to pick it up and helped Black with something. He wasn't only friendly, he was proactive. He switched so easily, like it didn't mean anything, like it was so normal. He could have been stealing a minute ago, and now he was completely normal.</p>
<p>William was in the store as well, and when Charlotte leaned over the counter again, this time just to look, she saaw Daniel was still there in the corner looking at something, and at the counter was her beloved William. He worked seriously and was surrounded by his colleagues, they were friendly and he was in good company. But Charlotte thought about it, if William wanted to escape with her, she would go along. She would be okay with that. She could never tell her parents this, or her friends, but she would follow him wherever he was going.</p>
<p>After work William closed up the store with Elizabeth, he said bye to Jeena, or was it someone else, he wasn't sure. It was dark and he didnt' care anymore. At midnight he walked through the scenery, the last he saw of it had been the early afternoon sun. He had gone straight to work and talking and explaining mode. Now he was free.</p>
<p>He went through the staff door and after it was in a different place. Charlotte was sitting in the shadows waiting for him on the bench. She was brushing her delicate hair with a delicate comb. Her clothes fluttered like butterfly wings. He knew that two doors away, behind a different door in the hotel, Annalise was waiting for him. She was probably half asleep and tired, but sitting with her legs crossed and wearing a big puffy jacket.</p>
<p>William approached Charlotte, he was acting different to how he acted around Annalise, or around anyone else. Each person brought out a unique part of him that changed him microscopically, it was the atom in the location. And when they described him he was always different, depending on who was telling the story.</p>
<p>He didn't know which girl to choose, which door to open, it seemed like the same obstacles and rewards were on both sides. If enough time passed it would all look the same grey anyway. They were edited by the hands of time.(Photoshopped)</p>
<p>“You look different” Charlotte was smiling to see him, and shivering a little in the cold. She wasn't wearing much, maybe it was a question asking him to hug her. “Did you just come from a rehearsal for your thing?” </p>
<p>“What thing” he said.</p>
<p>“Your stealing thing, job, mission, whatever you want to call it”</p>
<p>“Shh” he put his hand on her mouth. “Don't talk about that”</p>
<p>She frowned her lips under his finger. “You never tell me anything, but you expect me to always tell you my secrets, I'll only tell you if you tell me”</p>
<p>“No”</p>
<p>“You don't treat me right” she said. It was a long thought that she was finally speaking, she had delayed it until now because she was afraid that it would bring them apart. But now it was so strong that she just had to. It was so normal to him, but she was choking and struggling to get the words out. The contrast was huge, and not as she pictured it would be.</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“You're still with that girl” she said, “If you like me so much then you should be with me, not with her. You keep on telling me these things”</p>
<p>“What things?”</p>
<p>“These things like how you admire me, how you respect me and think I'm so pretty or whatever, you've said it so many times that I don't even believe it anymore. It's like sugar I eat and eat until it's not sweet, it's just normal. And fattening. You probably say it to all the girls, you're one of those guys”</p>
<p>“Those guys?” William said, “Do I have a sticker on me or whatever saying I'm one of those? That's insulting, that after all this time you still don't know me well”</p>
<p>“Is it true?” she said</p>
<p>“Is what true?”</p>
<p>“You always do this too” she said</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>“You make me say and speak all this stuff, then when I ask you, you pretend like I didn't say anything, what's wrong with you, can't you just answer the first time?”</p>
<p>“What was it?”</p>
<p>“Do you like me more than the other girls?”</p>
<p>“Which girl?” William said, “I'm not sure which one you mean”</p>
<p>She gaped, “How could you say that” She saw him smiling, he was teasing her about this.</p>
<p>“I'm just joking” he laughed, “I don't know, I don't really want to leave her, and I don't think that's a good question, I don't feel comfortable comparing you to others, you're you, and they're them.”</p>
<p>“Right?” she said, “So why are you still with her? Or them, or however many you need to have in your life”</p>
<p>“But I love you” he said, “I told you that before”</p>
<p>“You told all of them, you tell everyone that, like we're all some sort of sexual slaves to you”</p>
<p>“You're not, but I said I only want to be friends”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes, it was the classic 'I only want to be friends' “Then what is this” she said, “What is happening with us?” They hugged and kissed and smiled and fucked, and he said that they were just close. How could he do that, to do whatever he liked with her, and then take a step back as soon as she tried to understand it.</p>
<p>William didn't understand either, it was all so sudden. He took a step back with his hands raised, like he was making an invisible wall in front of himself to keep all her away. She just watched him disappear further away, she couldn't bear looking at him. It was humiliating for her as well,  this kind of thing didn't happen to her often. Usually she was the one walking away.</p>
<p>“What is it about me?” Charlotte said, looking down at her feet below the bench, when she moved a toe, the corresponding toe also moved. It seemed so miraculous. “That's not enough” When she looked up, she saw the stars, but no matter how hard she concentrated and stared, there was nothing she could change about it, the sky was a final static constant that was out of her control. And right now that made her frustrated. Any other time it would make her comfortable and relax, but she felt upset about it. As if yelling to the sky would make this man come back to her.</p>
<p>William had walked out of work with a blank mind. He hadn't expected any of this, and as he walked away from Charlotte he saw her looking down, then slowly turn up and ask him this question of commitment. Here he faced a crossroad, either he said yes, and went one way where many men had tread, into deeper and more serious territory.  Or he took the other route and went into other territory that a number of equally legible men had taken.</p>
<p>Then he realized that what had happened between him and Charlotte just now was an argument. It wasn't big, it wasn't loud, it was just a series of quiet questions and statements aimed at a calm understanding. But it was something of the sort fo a disagreement heavy enough to bring two people apart.</p>
<p>“There's nothing wrong with you, don't think like that”</p>
<p>“Then why are you going?” She couldn't speak straight, it was kind of difficult with tears running down and stuffing themselves down your throat, and your chin wrinkling up like a piece of paper. “Why can't you just stay here. With me”</p>
<p>“I can stay” he said</p>
<p>“No you can't, you're going now” she raised her finger and pointed to him, it was so obvious. But she felt so helpless, “Just stay here and do something with me” And now as he went back, she began to feel embarrassed as well. She was pleading him to stay and he just left her here. </p>
<p>“Is it her looks?” she said, “Is it because I gained a bit of weight recently? I can get skinny again too”</p>
<p>He shook his head, “Sorry Charlotte” and soon he had retreated far back enough that the mist and wind swallowed him whole. The air was pounding in her ears, she had repeated the same words many before her had uttered, but now it was just another speck of sound in the vast sky. Hey curiosity and love had splattered into a piece of dust she breathed out and joined the vortex of chaos around her. </p>
<p>She looked up once more.</p>
<p>No one was there.</p>
<p>William left Charlotte, he didn't dare go back. He didn't know what he thought, but he was a bit afraid of it. He went back through the staff door and took the other door, and as soon as it opened he could sigh a breath of relief. Those deep emotions passed with the hinges of the door, in front of him was Annalise. She was smiling and doing her shoelaces. “Oh you're here” she said, out of the corner of her eye, “I just got off work, let's go do something!” Her tone was a huge contrast to Charlotte's. And William was still dealing with the contrast of the argument with Charlotte straight to a close and tight relationship with Annalise. It was really a different facade. </p>
<p>“Where were you?” Annalise said.</p>
<p>“I was just talking to Charlotte”</p>
<p>The mention of the name changed her expression. Even here, two doors down, the reaction was negative. It was like any woman's name coming from his mouth cited a huge source of insecurity. Like a lump in the air suddenly was caught and captured by someone's mouth.</p>
<p>“Did you have a good talk?” Annalise said, she leant down to tie her next shoelace, but the way she said it was like she was tying it around his neck. She knew he was arguing two minutes ago, but she didn't ask him directly.</p>
<p>“I was arguing” he said.</p>
<p>She felt comforted that his response was as she expected, he had passed the test of trust. But it also meant that he had a sudden change. Annalise wasn't surprised, she had witnessed this William before. He could sometimes be the sweetest cutest man, and he was sometimes rude and intolerable. She saw him both ways and accepted him. He was really popular, so she felt like being with him was more valuable. But if you didn't know him, you could criticize him for being fake and horrible, and superficial. That was why Annalise wasn't surprised.</p>
<p>“She's weird” William said, “And really dramatic as well” he smiled at Annalise, finalising his choice with her. If he couldn't talk to one woman, he could still talk to the other. Charlotte knew that, and felt left out.</p>
<p>Annalise was glad he accepted her, it was flattering. But also she felt a little afraid, what if he left her, would it be the same as well?</p>
<p>“But screw me, I love that asshole. I wish he'd leave my life, I'd run up to him and tell him to piss off. But I love him so much that I'd beg him not to.” Charlotte told her friend, but the both of them didn't hear it.</p>
<p>“You came to me” Annalise said, “Of all the women and men out there, and the sexually ambivalent individuals, you came to me” Now she felt proud, finally. Like she had obtained a reward and was really starting to salivate and savour it. She reached out and stroked William's chin, she liked doing this. Most of the time she just felt like an ordinary woman doing ordinary things with any ordinary strengths or weaknesses that other people had. But right now with this man choosing her over everyone else, even when she didn't put that much of an effort into it, ths idea was pleasurable. She felt like she had won a challenge to tip the other rivals out of the water.</p>
<p>And so she looked at her prize, who stared back with solemn hard-ridden eyes, and she made him climb the last of the mountain towards her. Now that he was here she would make him work harder to stay here. “Do you trust me?” she said. Making ehrself seem larger than she was.</p>
<p>“Of course I do” he said.</p>
<p>“Don't you ever wonder if I lied?”</p>
<p>William said. “You're asking random questions suddenly, what's this about?”</p>
<p>“Just answer” she stepped back and crossed her arms. Not giving up herself until he did so.</p>
<p>And William said, “It doesn't matter”</p>
<p>“So it doesn't matter if I lie to you? It doesn't matter if my feelings for you are true or not?”</p>
<p>“No” William said, “I have no cause to doubt when you lied. But it's better to believe in your lies than to know the truth. Because you're worth it”</p>
<p>Now Annalise saw flowers, they were waving at her in a paddock and saying hi, saying that she had achieved something amazing.</p>
<p>William went on, to rub it in, “When in love, you feel like it's beyond you, you can't do anything about it. I feel like I'm giving up my control and understanding of life to someone else. To someone completely different and mysterious to us. And yet, despite this vulnerability and making yourself so fragile and naked, I still do it. So it's easy to believe in lies like yours, no matter how pathetic they are.” She stroked his chin as she said this, treating him like he was hers and he was supposed to listen to everything he said.</p>
<p>She approved.</p>

<h3 id="forty-seven7-gerry-aka-mr-danger">forty seven.7: Gerry A.K.A Mr. Danger</h3>
<p>“Have you heard about Gerry?” A woman with a loud voice said. She thought she was quiet, but she was one of those. “He got really upset, a huge overreaction at something that wasn't that big of a deal.” </p>
<p>She didn't know it but she was onto something. Mr. Danger had committed a huge crime that none of his team members knew about, Mr. Angry knew vague details and the results, but not about the specifics as to how it took place. Neither did any of the other members. Gerry was sometimes extremely violent and upset at the people who came around. It was like a trigger when he took a wrong step, but what was scary was that there was no strategy for why he would take a wrong step or go in the wrong direction. It was unpredictable, no one knew how he would act or react to things. They could only hope that they didn't step on a landmine when they were with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry knew a little about this history, but he still hired Gerry because the likelihood of Gerry doing something was low, and he was the most experienced with armed robbery. His CV had something like three or four legitimate news reported armed robberies with over twenty deaths each. He was very violent, he could be very violent, but he also wasn't desperate for the money. In a team like this, where most of the memebrs weren't very desperate for it, they should all be the same amount of desperate, and it was a good sign.</p>
<p>Going back a little, at the time of the heist Gerry was trying out a new sexuality. He was looking for guys to shove up the back door. And he recently acquired a boyfriend of expensive taste and extravagance. This man never touched water and only drank wine, his job before he quit to live with Gerry was a flower necklace maker, he would weave strands of flowers together to produce something remarkable. Gerry was amazed by the outcome and fell for him. They kissed for the first time on Christmas outside his parents' house.</p>
<p>But this man was poor, he didn't have a job, just faded jeans and a killer smile. Gerry and him were in dire need of money. So Gerry accepted the job. He was kind at heart, and a true lover, he felt like it was his calling somehow, but when he was doing jobs he forgot about all of that, anyone who stepped in his way was killed.</p>
<p>When he had to go to the meetings Gerry told his boyfriend he was a policeman, so he got calls every now and then, and he went ot the meetings. Saying this made his boyfriend less needy. Sometimes the man was very needy, and it was tiring to try and sort him out. </p>
<p>Gerry woke up one morning with a sore butt, but he didn't fuss over it, he simply put some lotion on, slipped it on his bum and went to work. When he came home he told his boyfriend how this next 'project' would get them a lot of money, and they would be able to buy anything. </p>
<p>“I don't care about buying things anymore” Lennie said, “I just want you, I can't live without you, I realized that after you left last time, I've never been so in love with anyone”</p>
<p>“Aww” Gerry leaned in to hug him, “That's so sweet, I'venever been told that by anyone before. If I can just live with you, I'm happy as well” Gerry had to comfort his sweet sweet man. </p>
<p>Lennie's ringtone rang, his phone was on the coat hanger and he fetched it. It was Nicki Minaj's song, about superifical things. He bobbed his head to it. Recently he really admried her lifestyle, he always thought his lfiestyle was bad, until he learned of her, and saw how her lifestyle was a worse version of his, but she had succeeded, it emant that his lifestyle was legit as well.</p>
<p>“You like her?” Gerry said. He didn't say how he felt. His tone was a ltitle negative, so he probably felt it that way.</p>
<p>“I know she's so vain and so shallow, and so proud and arrogant. But she has a kind side and respects him others some reason. She gives her boyfriend presents and isn't embarrassed to be around him. And he is touched by her kindness, she is so proud, but still has time for others. For some reaosn that's what I think”</p>
<p>Gerry watched his man speak, and for some reason felt a reconfirmation of why he was in love with this man. He hadn't told him yet, he didnt' want to be too forward, but he was in love, he had to be. And this made him more motivated to pull off the heist. He wanted to do this all for Lennie. Surely if ti was for someone else then it was a good reason.</p>
<p>At the next meeting, as usual Mr. Angry spoke a lot, he spoke for an hour. But only a few things sinked into Gerry's small head. Rivals are the closest to you, have the same people they need and same people they help. The key is to have, to really want it enough, then you'll work it out. If you want it enough then the problems will be solved one by one until it's just a straight path leading there. And then you look back and wonder why it was so difficult to do it in the first place. This made Gerry want to do better, it gave him a strength that beat any strength he had felt in a while.</p>
<p>Gerry looked over the slip he was given. If anything went wrong he had to do something horrible, he was standing guard near the reception and had to kill the woman on duty if she turned their way. If she turned their way she would see that they were taking one of the forms. It was Mr.Lazy's wife. Because she had signed up to be a guard, and on the roster it just happened to be her. He could only hope that she wouldn't step around that corner where Mr. Chatterbox was taking the signed forms. And he hoped he could get away before his teammate found out his wife was dead by his hands. </p>
<p>Mr. Danger didn't mind the killing, but he was afraid to face his teammate about it, who he really respects. He didn't say it, but he respected Mr. Lazy. For being able to hodl a stable relationship, for never saying a bad thing about anyone, and for always being trustworthy. He felt like if he were given the opportunity, they could become good friends. Mr. Lazy was doing this heist for his wife, and Mr. Danger was doing it for his partner.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox was the only other one who knew about this. And she refused to take the gun from Mr. Angry. She couldn't shoot Charlotte, who was also a guard on that day. Or Laura, she couldn't shoot anyone, no matter how many problems it might solve. She couldn't possibly do something so selfish. Then she felt bad, if she weren't this person she would have no trouble doing so. She wanted to disregard her values and step up to the occasion, in a strange way she felt weak. Yet she felt extremely strong to stand up to her values as well. There were only a handful of things more attractive than that.</p>
<p>After Gerry got the parchment telling him what to do, a strange feeling went through him. He felt guilty knowing so much, gaining so much knowledge about the world. He felt like it made sense, and it was clicking into place. This parchment was the rules by which he should live, he took it home and framed it up on the wall, putting a glass coating over it and checking to make sure it didn't collect dust. And the man who wrote this, he started to hold a deep respect for.</p>
<p>Gerry broke up with his boyfriend with the usual reasons. Life came in and tore them apart. But after this man, he got with a woman. Maybe it was to make a statement about his sexuality, or maybe he just wanted to touch something new.</p>
<p>This woman was dramatic, when Gerry met her she was preaching to her friends about their involvement in her relationship. She easily brought about tears. But Gerry clicked with her instantly and the two started up a firey relationship. The woman worked in administration, she dealt with clients who were troublesome and caused trouble. She had stacks of papers next to her that she kept updating and punching into the computer. After a while she stopped thinking about work and focused on Gerry. She courted him for half a day until he turned his head towards her, then she acted coy for the rest of the day until he took the last steps.</p>
<p>It was a normal romance for her, they usually started like this and went on. But when she met Gerry she learnt that he was doing something dangerous. He told her directly during their first date when he was coming all over her carpet. She directed the hose away from her face and off the carpet outside the window so it sprayed over the passers-by far below.</p>
<p>She was upset, “The GM is my friend, my good friend, I do his taxes” she said. “I don't like you stealing from him”</p>
<p>Gerry nodded and winked and sighed, anything, he was coming so he didn't have a choice. But after it was all finished and looked like a wax museum he wiped it off and threw the tissue out the window. Down below it hit someone on the head but they didn't notice and kept walking.</p>
<p>After this sexual job, she left her man, Gerry. She wanted to stand for her morals because no one else would stand for hers. She met him a week later and told him to knock on her room door. When she heard the knock she invited him in and seated him on the bed easing him into it. And she told Gerry that she thought what he was doing was really wrong, and gave a long speech that she had prepared in her right pocket of why he shouldn't do it, and she would leave him if he did it. She really didn't want to leave him, but she would do it, because it was right and moral.</p>
<p>She put the speech back in her pocket, then he said okay, she could leave if that was how she felt. And she did, and they parted ways.</p>
<p>Later Gerry told his friend, who  was beginning to become more than a friend, about this woman, that she left and didn't care, she loved him so much she said, but he didn't really mind her leaving or staying, it made no difference to him.</p>
<p>“Don't tell her that” the friend said. He looked at Gerry and felt a tinge of fear, this man had no roots, people around him could leave or come as they liked and it wouldn't matter to him.
“I always wanted a girlfriend” Gerry said, he crossed his arms and protected the coffee he had. He couldn't explain why, it was just a natural action for him. “I'm always single, I've walked my life pretty much alone until now, and never thought much of it. But when I come to this city and see everyone with someone else, suddenly I want one too. That's it, it's that simple really.”</p>
<p>“So you and her, you never talk anymore, or do you keep in touch?” the friend said.</p>
<p>“We don't talk anymore. Well, she threatened to tell others about the heist I was doing at the time. She felt jealous that it was the only thing I was thinking about, it was the only thing important to me, and I wasn't giving any time to her. She felt a little left out, naturally. Everything was a purpose for her, if she walked there instead of here. You know there's a reason why. She never just lived. So when she said something, even the most trivial thing, there was a reason. She could look at the rain just starting to fall when we're walking together, and it meant that she was in a bad mood last night because of some way I responded, and I was supposed to understand that.</p>
<p>“Oh, she's one of those” the friend said. “She will do anything to create a future with you, she wants to get married someday right? And settle here and grow a family, and want you to achieve your dreams about betterment of the world or something”</p>
<p>“Exactly” Gerry said, “You can't reason with one of those.”</p>
<p>“So I told her what I thought, as if I was drunk and it was all piercingly true, I told her that I didn't respect her job working with the GM, it was low, and repetitive, and just using the same skills you had the whole time without developing anything. I didn't respect her job as much as I should. That's half the reason I'm in this heist”</p>
<p>he looked around. “I'm good at my job, everyone knows that. I dress like this” he ran his fingers donw and showed how he was messed up and dirty. How his clothing didn't match what he was doing. He worked behind a counter with a suit and tie and no pants on underneath. He listened to heavy metal music when his boss wasn't around. He was a slacker who as soon as he steps into work became perfect and close to omniscient. He was infallible and demanded that everyone listen to him. And after they listened he talked trash when they turned their backs.</p>
<p>The woman had been observing him, she saw that gap in him between the reaches of her eyelashes. She saw his exuberant confidence and was turned on. She saw him change so fast. She sat there looking attractive and waiting for his advance, she gave him signals to approach, a green light here, a laugh there, a brush upstairs. But he wasn't interested in women. As she sat there attempting to attract him, like a flower, he has working to attract men of all sizes and colours. He wasn't oblivious to her advances. She saw his disinterest in women, not at all.</p>
<p>This was the first show that Gerry was a thinker and not just some guy who was cruising, he was actually thinking about some things, and perhaps that was why this woman was so attracted to him in the first place. Despite what everyone else thought about him.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven8-the-spy">forty seven.8: The SPY</h3>
<p>All this time hardly anyone knew, but one of them (Gerry/Mr. Glamorous/Mr. Danger/ Mr. Smiles/Mr. Buttsex) was a spy, each time he went to a meeting and lied about his identity he felt guilty about it and needed to unwind to his partner every night, saying how he felt like he should fit in as part of his job, but he couldn't. He wanted to be at one with them but he couldn't. </p>
<p>Before moving here for this mission he was in the changing room of the police force. His muscles were one and a half times larger than his colleagues, his dick was one and a half times longer, and his empathy was one and a half times less than others. His colleagues, they mistreated him slightly because he was always upset and doing things quietly by himself and didn't fit in with the rest of them, muttering weird and private thoughts to himself and smiling about jokes that he rememberd while drinking a bottle of water, and the water spitting out of his mouth and onto the computer screen in front of him. He didn't need anyone, and that was probably why no one approached him, because they could sense that from a distance. His usual resting mode was a permanent 'Don't-Annoy-Me-Fuckers' expression. But actually he was the nicest man.</p>
<p>The spy walked around and around and came back home. He already forgot what he did that day. He felt restless now, everything was piling onto each other and he was troubled. He was waiting for the point after the mission when it would all go back to normal, but yet he felt so troublesome right now. He walked in the front door, it closed and the lights in the house came on one by one.</p>
<p>Now let's step back. At all of these important points in the story where big things happened. (Scroll through the important parts of dialogue in the meetings, where Mr. Chatterbox is slapped, where they are each sharing stories, where Mr. Melancholy is saying something, when they are complaining about Mr. Angry. </p>
<p>In all of these situations the SPY was present, he was carefully observing his surroundings. He wasn't looking for the perfect moment when everyone was asleep, to strike. No, he would sit there and sit there through the whole thing like a fly on the wall. Or like a ghost staring through the window, or like a security camera, watching silently and disguising himself. He gave himself a characteristic to follow and a subtle mannerism to make himself a more unique character. He socialized with everyone else just to the right amount, Not too much to create attention, but not too little to attract curiosity. He waited until everything was finished, then he would quietly go to his boss in the police department and reported everything that happened. From there the police could track it easily. After it happened they would say that this was a group of thieves who should never be placed together, it is difficult to imagine so much damage being caused by such a small group of people. If it was destruction they wanted, then they wrought it. No doubt about it. And then the Police chief with the brown moustache would stamp a 'finished' sign on it. And everything would have ended.</p>
<p>The SPY was talking to a woman with one of the other members. She looked at him and suddenly got really upset, and scary. “That's rude” She uncrossed her legs from the red couch she was residing on and shifted her behind to be less accessible. Estrus was far away now. The SPY had joked about her appearance and she was offended.</p>
<p>“What?” he said, “It's not like I said you were fat”</p>
<p>“You don't have to” she said, “You don't have to say that, there's a lot more other things to upset us than that, and you've succeeded, good on you, is your gigantic male ego satisfied?”</p>
<p>“It is” he cocked his head, it was a bit surprising that this felt interesting. She was bringing out something in him that he hadn't realized he had. A Gigantic male ego, a purpose and a direction to throw his efforts in.</p>
<p>Every time these two met they argued about Men and Women, which are more complicated. Everytime he saw her face he instantly started arguing about it, and she flared about in response. They claimed who was more complicated, and just kept carrying on the conversation.</p>
<p>After their argument and shouting and banging against the wall, then she said she would like him to greet her properly. A simple 'Hi' or 'How's it going' would be nice.</p>
<p>He felt like women were always wanting to change men, and trying to do so, “I told you last time, I'm not changing, I will change, but if you direct me to it I won't, I will rebel against it with all I have. I don't want to say it again, havent you learned?”</p>
<p>“No, I just want you to realize that you're not the only one in the world, there's others around you too.”</p>
<p>It didn't hit him, he kept to his static frame of mind, “Are you trying to change me? I'm not going to change to anything, I will do what I want, you're not my boss, only I am my boss. I can pretend to listen to you, and you may never know, but I'm not even going to do that anymore.”</p>
<p>She was powerful, and expecting this. He said this and she smiled, she wouldn't say anything, but she joked with her friends that she just suggests something, or did something, and it made him act a certain way that she wanted him to, without him realizing. He's manipulating her.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing” he said, “Aren't you upset?” </p>
<p>She stopped laughing and glared at him like a candle on a special persons' birthday. “Why are you so negative, you have nothing good to say, you're just negative about me and everyone, always complaining, after talking to you I always feel like I'm drowning. I'm not going to let it get to me, you're just someone I'm crossing on the street, it doesn't even matter. Why can't you support me or be grateful for all these small things, you have so much you know”</p>
<p>“Always drowning, what kind of shit is that? Do you ever speak properly? How much shit will you spout before you realize that you're spouting shit.”</p>
<p>“What?” She waved her hand making him explain more “Does that even mean?” Her hair dangled like a vine beside her as her head moved.</p>
<p>“We're in the real world, not in your fucking poetry”</p>
<p>“I'm speaking properly now” she said. “Don't blame me because you don't understand English, and you have no sense of imagination.” She turned her head. “And you're offensive, always. What did I do to deserve this. It's like you just offend me because you're bored and you want some drama. You want me to cry or yell back like it's any of your business what I want to do.” She faced away and wiped her face, he thought she was wiping tears that trickled down her eyes like pillars connecting the roof and the sky. “I'm sure you've seen me cry.” she said, “It's not like this time is any different from the usual”</p>
<p>“Did I offend you?” he said. He tried to turn her around, but she hid her face, like it meant nothing. He wanted to see her, but she kept turning until he couldn't anymore.</p>
<p>He stopped, and after a bit she turned back, her hands were back down and she was smiling. </p>
<p>“You were crying”</p>
<p>“See, I'm fine” she smiled.</p>
<p>“Why are you so afraid to cry in front of me?”</p>
<p>“Because you're not the one” she said.</p>
<p>“You're still looking for that purpose in your life? By the way, did I offend you?”</p>
<p>“You always offend me” she looked around on the ground at her sandals and then at the time. “But that's pretty much normal with us”</p>
<p>“I offend you? Every time?”</p>
<p>“Yes, so what” she said. “I'm used to it now”</p>
<p>“Why do you let yourself take that?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” she put some lipstick on. Looking in a tiny mirror from the road signpost. “It's probably because I love you”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” He had to pause for a second to swallow it. She didn't change her actions at all, she was still the same.</p>
<p>“I love you” she said, “But I don't know if you love me, and it's sad so I don't think about it” Now she was looking at the hairs on the front of her head briefly, then packed the mirror away to look back at him. Expecting him to continue, she passed the ball on, but it was a heavy blow to receive.</p>
<p>“I don't know why, but as soon as I start being truthful it becomes negative” She was surprised by his sincerity, she wasn't expecting so much. “I want to show kindness compassion, hope, optimism, and I can, I definitely can, but as soon as I try to speak truthfully and meaningfully, it's a disagreement with everyone, a big conflict, and I starting creating dissension, so I don't really speak what I really think anymore.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?” That was all she managed to say. In some ways he was answering her questions more than ever before. She wanted to remember this moment, remember what he was saying so she could store it in a file cabinet to access any time. Just in case she was dissatisfied with something she could refer back to it.</p>
<p>“I don't really fit in in society, that's why I became a policeman, because I wanted to understand society. But with these friends I can really fit in and share myself around, or they treat me like I'm one of them, and I know it's selfish, but it feels really nice to fit in once in a while. Besides, I'm a third culture person, I don't have any roots, or loyalties, I just have people who pay me money to act, and I don't know how to act, so I do all sorts of different things. Maybe I'm bad for not kicking these criminals out, I don't know.”</p>
<p>“So, do they welcome you as well?” She stepped forward and tidied up his collar. Her approach to life was not a search for adventure, she kept looking back and trying to tidy things up, so that whatever came next was organized and clean. He just went and looked for change, leaving a change behind him. And she was a step behind and tidying up his mess. At the end of the day it took her a little time to catch up to where he was. “It would be good to feel welcome, everyone needs to feel welcome.”</p>
<p>“Everyone is so optimistic and so passionate and I want to join them but it's not right and I can't agree with it, so I don't and I step out and disagree with them. I wish I could be there with them, but I also have this purpose that is different.” He explained his conflict to this woman, who tried to suck, and kiss his worries away from his dick, like when they take the brains out of a mummies' nose.</p>
<p>She listened, she thought he was overthinking it, “It's not that big a deal though right? There's bigger problems in life.”</p>
<p>To him, this was a big problem, and her saying that was essentially a break-up. She was warm and considerate and popular, but she didn't understand a thing he was saying. And for her, she just wanted him to feel calm and accepted, for some reason she really respected him.</p>
<p>But if he had told someone else, they would have told him that it was useful to think about this, and get clear about things so that he could take the next step that he wanted to take in life. She didn't tell him, but recently she felt sad, because she cared for him so much and wanted to support him but she didn't know how to. She could say things but he didn't respond positively and warmly, she could do something else. Sometimes he was just friednly and cheerful even without her instigation. And she found herself doing nothing all day but preparing herself in front of the mirror. She was cleaning her lips and polishing them like the ancient porcelain vases crafted by masters longer than 2,000 years ago. Because he really loved her lips. He always had, and she was pretty confident that he always would. And she also felt violated and unhappy that he would do these things, and really needed to find a way out. Her body felt used by him, somehow, and she didn't know why. Maybe she just wasn't ready for this. Although he was respectful and this was what everyone did, others did a lot dirtier things than this.</p>
<p>“I'm not proud of you stealing” she said. “I think it's very disrespectful, I don't know if I want to be with you anyumore” (Comic in the way it is expressed so suddenly and illogically flowing)</p>
<p>He wanted to tell her why, that he was working for a noble cause, that he was sent to set things right, but he couldn't because he promised the police not to tell, and because he was embarrassed to tell her that he wasn't working with the criminals, because the more time he spends with them the more he starts to respect them. He lied outright that he is one of them and rejected the police easily, and it became easier and easier to reject the police when he was with them. Now he was in a bit of a conflict, what if he didn't tell the police about it? Or should he do the right thing, but how right was the 'right' thing supporting the police?</p>
<p>He was conflicted.</p>
<p>Then one day when they crossed on the street, instigated by texts, she said she would try to get rid of his worries again. And she did the same thing, and he was disgusted by how lusty she was, but she kept on going at it until he released, she sucked everything clean, then the next day she was worried, really worried, for no reason, about nonsense things. With his problems. She couldn't handle them, and he was completely normal about it. She had really sucked up and taken in all of his worries. Whenever she sucked, she asked him why he didn't make a sound to show her whether he was enjoying it or not enjoying it. But he didn't...truth be told, he didn't even notice her there doing all this work. Because his worries are gone, he doesn't even care anymore, even about her.</p>
<p>“See that ridiculous sun, keep me in your heart for a while.” She laughed and said. Quoting one of her favourite songs. She forgot where it came from. She didn't know why she bothered with this man, there were so many others, but maybe she felt like if she was in a relationship she was safer or felt more calm.</p>
<p>The SPY said he wasn't sure about his life to her. They were hugging next to the river. There was a concrete lookout to look at the valleys carved by the glaciers in their retreat. The glaciers didn't leave anything to chance, they would take as much of the earth with them as they left. The Spy told his woman how he didn't know if he had done the right thing for the right people, and who were the right people, how about himself? Where did he fit in to all of this? He was always worried about others judging him, he was so afraid that others would treat him bad.</p>
<p>She stood there next to him, every couple had their romantic moments, showered by intimate moments, and moments when you didn't want to say something to offend them. The best things were highlighted by joint intentions that collided and became huge explosions that littered themselevs over everyone, hot and warmth. She looked at this scenery, she had come ehre twice before, once with a friend while they talked about work, and once with a group of girlfriends. But she never came here and was touched. Something about his presence here made it feel so different, she didn't know why. But if he left, she may not be able to feel this way again.</p>
<p>And then he talked about his parents, if they knew he was homosexual they would disown him. He has so many boyfriends, but he can't take them home, and can't show his parents. A good marriage could only happen with parent's approval, but they say being gay is a sin, and it's not natural, and he can't live with it. But if it's a sin, then why does he feel so natural to be doing it? And why does nothing bad happen? Instead he is able to make others and himself a lot happier.</p>
<p>She just listened. It was too different, she could undertsnads bits and pieces of sturggling to be accepted, it was one of the stories of every child.</p>
<p>“The ironic part of sketching is that you have to draw a detail first before you know whether or not it is in proportion or not, or in the right place. I'm a sketcher, you know that right? I practiced it a lot before coming here, I practiced it so much that it made me want to faint.”</p>
<p>“Yes, so?” he said.</p>
<p>“I think maybe life is the same, you have to live and live it vividly in detail before you can know if it is in proportion or not, or out, or things about it. It's like saying something is wrong before you have seen it before. I think we do that a lot.”</p>
<p>The SPY, at first was set in his ways, he knew what he was going to do, he had his mission engrained. But once he attended ten meetings with these cold and heartless criminals who only talked about propagating themselves, he started to see differently. He slowly started thinking about these criminals, he started to see things the way they did. And he started to agree with them when they talked about things. He went home and started to feel conflicted, what were these things that were changing him, it was uncalled for. When Mr. Angry described the treasure, he used to want to catch these people in the act of stealing. But now he was inspired by the whole process and wanted to see this treasure as well. And he wanted to see the GM's woman who was becoming something of a legend the more he thought about it. If someone was thought about for more than 100 hours, then they became a legend. And their nose was sore from sneezing.</p>
<p>When the spy came out of these criminal meetings he felt like he needed a balance. He showed kindness to everyone he met and made sure they were enjoying it.</p>

<h3 id="forty-seven9">forty seven.9:</h3>
<p>William ate a big meal of happyness. He threw it away in the bin, he stuffed it in through all the shit piled on top from other peoples' happiness meals. There were hard feelings between him and the other member, Gerry. </p>
<p>William had just broken up with Annalise. Even though two chapters ago he told Charlotte that he wouldn't break up, now he had already done so and was moving on. William could make a girl cry, or make her laugh, just depending on when they saw him. There was no consistency in his behaviour. And he was frequently told that he should realize that there are others around him, not just himself. And his behaviours effect others. But he wanted to tell others to mind their own business and not be affected by him all the time.</p>
<p>Afterwards Annalise wandered the halls. She had expected this in the back of her mind, it was a fear she carried with her all the time that had now blown up and flew off and dyed the walls around her. She was lost in these hallways, she didn't know who she was, what she had given so much to and put an effort in was no more. And then she wondered why these things happened to her. Was it her, was it him?</p>
<p>Then she looked up and saw Gerry standing in front of a door, he was holding a key out, too small of his well-developed hand full of capabilities. He was crushing it against the door and trying to open it but it didn't work and wouldn't go anywhere. She went over and wordlessly took the key, she put it in the keyhole and swung it. The door opened. It smelled like roses and beautiful petals, there was romantic music playing, and the fragrance of babies. And behind the door was a beautiful man naked and lying across the bed. </p>
<p>Beside her, Gerry swallowed, his Adam's apple moved up and back down. She admired it and wondered if she could take it and eat it. Right now anything seemed possible, she was hungry as well. Gerry was looking at the man in the room, his eyes were sweet and full of love. A deep understanding existed between them. The longer Annalise watched him the more she felt out of place, and the more she felt like it should be her standing there in that place.</p>
<p>She reached out as Gerry walked in, and she picked the apple from his throat. He looked shocked and silently touched the area she had touched, but he was distracted.</p>
<p>Annalise followed Gerry into the room, she closed the door behind her with an excited smile to the outside. The door shut, it had a weird border pattern around it, red and an old green, with protruding wooden sections with peeling old black paint.</p>
<p>That night Gerry got with Annalise, after William, and there was hard feelings between the two guys. It was a mutual understanding that only one of them could reach the peak of the mountain first, the others couldn't and were left behind. Only one of them could dive into the cave first. She was William's leftovers. But he didn't finish the job.</p>
<p>As Gerry and his friend went through Annalise they discussed William's fingerprints on her. How she had him written all over her. She didn't listen and begged them to go on.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-seven10-at-the-very-end">forty seven.10: At the very end</h3>
<p>At the very end Gerry was walking along and ran into William. He showed William his room at the end, a week beforehand of the hesit, and it was already empty.</p>
<p>“Haven't you emptied yours yet? You know what Mr. Angry said, you gotta be prepared for it”</p>
<p>“But if I change my room, how can I sleep in it? It's not mine anymore, and it means that my world has literally changed”</p>
<p>Gerry looked at him, “You're right, that's really smart, I never thought of that”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-eight-right-before">forty eight: Right Before:</h3>
<p>okay, this is near the end guys, the heist never happens and it is going to happen. Then we later see the implications of all of these things happening and what everyone is saying about it.
It's near the end!!!</p>
<p>The Heist started with Mr.Melancholy standing in front of a gate, it was supposed to unlock at exactly 2:02:30, universal time, and he wondered if it really would, and a part of him hoped that it wouldn't, he could just walk away from it and life oculd go back to normal, he woudln't lose anything or gain anything. He didn't want to do this heist, he didn't want to risk this. If it didn't open then he had a reason not to do what he was about to do. He might be able to stay the same person.</p>
<p>Then the light on the small keyhole glowed green and he opened the door and walked through.</p>
<p>Sixteen floors under, Mr. Chatterbox wiped her brow after tweaking the wires leading to places. She had waited six hours to do so. Now it officially started.</p>
<p>Mr. Danger was holding the rope in the elevator shaft, eager to get going.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy was dressed as a porter and he walked around with a large smile, talking to everyone as they came around. Today was the same as every day. But in an hour he would start his mission. A tingle of excitement and stress ran down his back and his right shoulder.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry stood in the store browsing the goods. He pressed a button in his pocket and a loud sound in the hotel went off.</p>
<p>Mr. Purple stood in front of the GM's door. She was wearing a suit on the outside, and underneath was a nightgown. Underneath that was single-use lingerie made of the softest fibre that could be ripped off with ease and made a mess. She reached out with a rock solid knuckle and breathed in. She hesitated for a moment and thought about it. Her expression was the same usual enigmatic and unsure one.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forty-nine-the-bus-out">forty nine: The Bus Out</h3>
<p>The air was dark and heavy. A calm raindrop fell from the ceiling onto a hare which had its ears perked up and stood on its hind legs to see far away, like a statue. The raindrop flicked its ear down and made it anxious. It looked around the stage for a threat and ducked down. The grass howled into the stones as strong gusts blew past it and made it collapse. The nature was alive, the promise of rain brought about a competition that had not been seen in a while. In the grass the hare blended into something else, and as it grew darker all of the variations started to disappear into one shade. Only the moon surfaced, and it zoomed across the sky, a shining pancake.</p>
<p>A single bus pulled through the night, it came up a hill with its lights full beam like a monster creeping through the night and going towards the other side. The beams terraced the landscape and made it look anew, like something had come through it and awakened it. In the silence of the night the bus pulled closer and closer, growing, with a driver sitting in front. It went through to the other side and pulled past.</p>
<p>Looking from the outside, it was just another bus going to another destination, with more toursits and specialized people in it. But actually there were many things going on here and many resolved and unresolved issues that existed. Let's look at a few.</p>
<p>When we go through the doors of the bus, there's five people talking it's loud, someone's playing music from one of the seats, most of the seats are unoccupied and everyone's talking, they have wine spilling everywhere, glasses breaking, and a big red cat sitting on the doorknob. </p>
<p>Firstly, Mr. Angry was driving the bus, he had one foot on the accelerator and one foot tapping to the drumbeat of the music. He had one hand on the wheel, and the other resting on Mr. Purple's butt. Everytime there was a curve in the road he grabbed her butt and pinched it, and she squealed. </p>
<p>Mr. Purple was leaning over, she had her skirt hitched up and showed high heels underneath. Her top was black and had stains of red on it. (We'll find out what those are soon) She was talking to Mr. Lazy and Mr. Melancholy. Who each had their say.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox was the last person, sitting, she was sitting in the back row and taking in the scenery, quietly understanding what was happening and how things were going on. She stared outside the window.</p>
<p>Outside the wind pushed past like a wave that was swallowing them deeper and deeper into a tunnel, or out of it, depending on what she chose to believe. She stuck her head out to see the silent road and road marks running past her, or toward her. And then brought her head back in to see how it was so loud and cheerful, and these people were talking about what happened. They laughed about it with no moral consequence whatsoever. Mr. Melancholy, her lover, was watching the only other woman here. Everyone was watching that woman.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy watched Mr. Purple lean over and be touched by Mr. Angry. She was there, just there. Ravaged, but still behaving the same way. And Mr. Angry and Mr. Lazy were treating her the same way, as if nothing had changed. Mr. Melancholy couldn't see her the same way anymore, but the others all did.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and the memories came. They flooded him like a giant waterballoon hovered over the world and cracked itself when it hit the mountain of his head.</p>
<p>Memories I...</p>
<p>They met on the top floor and opened the final door together. They finally saw the door, what it was in pictures would not describe the magnificence of what lay in front of them. Pure gold stacked in every corner. William stood in the corner when they met up and felt relieved. One of them, he forgot who, opened the door somehow, it was part of their script. He forgot how the door opened, or who was where, all he noticed was this woman. He saw her and somehow every woman in his memory vanished, every happiness and joy he experienced with them vanished, and he was focused on this one woman who was unique beyond unique. Then, the woman was sitting there, she was shocked to see these people, she had never met them before. It was the first outsiders she saw.</p>
<p>Her legs uncrossed and she stood up slowly, in a white dress. The curtains were shut and a dim yellow glow emanated from the side of the room. There were decks of cards lying around, board games from different generations and a dim yellow light. </p>
<p>On the sofa lying across and fallen like an acorn was she. She woke up when they came in, she was first sleepy, then shocked, then she became gradually excited. Watching her was like watching a flower bloom in slow motion. She had grown up here all her life, with flowers in bloom around her, the curtains closed and the windows glazed gold. The lights were always on, and it was soundproof. This was the place the GM housed his treasure, like a bank safe. William still felt the dust on his hands from their climb up, and his watch showed that they only had eight and a half minutes.</p>
<p>There were three doors, William only knew what one of them was. He stood there and remembered Mr. Purple walked past them all. She was as elegant as a minx. She silently disappeared through the right door. Her palm circled the doorknob and disappeared from view. Mr. Purple was to remain inside until further instructions were given.</p>
<p>William, who had feelings for Mr. Purple now, knew she was going next door to be slept with by that nasty GM. He wanted to reach out and hold her back from going, he didn't want her to go and she knew, but she had to go because it was a key part of the mission.</p>
<p>And so William was there as he heard Mr. Purple moaning in the next room. Shewas being ravaged by the GM. He wanted to just take a gun in and shoot the GM. But the GM's heart was linked to an alarm system as well, everything was linked to an alarm system in here.</p>
<p>There was a loud sound and Mr. Melancholy opened his eyes, they were stuck together but he tore them apart and saw everyone stopped and looking out the windshield of the bus. </p>
<p>“It's a rat” Mr. Purple said, her voice still sounded drunk, and her ass was swollen red like a baboon in estrus.</p>
<p>“It's not a rat, it's a person. There's the head, look” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Fuck whatever it is, we're moving” Mr. Angry stepped on the gas and the bus jerked away. Whatever it was on the road started to moving under the front tires, then the back, then it moved further back from them. No matter how fast they drove the bus didn't move, and things kept catching up to them, that was how it felt.</p>
<p>The bus drove on, and everyone began to tire, the adrenaline wore off and the excitement became dimmer. They started to slowly reflect on their situation and where they were. They were moving out of the moment and into a scenery.</p>
<p>“Who was the first person you saw?” Mr. Lazy had made his way to the back of the bus and lay down on the seats. The dirt on his shoes stuck out onto the aisle.</p>
<p>“I saw Charlotte” Mr. Melancholy said. Also laying down behind him. He let it sink in, what had just happened. “We took it, and we finally got out, and everything worked! It was a miracle, I was so excited.”</p>
<p>“I was too” Mr. Lazy said, his arms crossed under his head. “Until that went wrong”</p>
<p>“Yeah that was when I first started to think that we might not make it back, and then the first face I saw was Charlotte waiting for me. Do you know her?”</p>
<p>“Fuck I don't know how you do it” Mr. Lazy said. He meant about all fo the women, he strained his neck to see Mr. Chatterbox, she was a fine looking woman, and she had sworn herself to this guy, even when he tried to get with her she refused. Even when she knew that the guy had girls everywhere.</p>
<p>“Did it” Mr. Melancholy said. “It's over now” He looked back at the lights fading further and further away and confirmed it in his mind.</p>
<p>“How about you?” Mr. Melancholy said. “Who did you see?”</p>
<p>“I saw my wife. You know her?”</p>
<p>“Laura right? I saw her a couple of times”</p>
<p>“Man it feels like ages since we were back there, we were there for a whole winter, but it feels like much longer right?”Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“Don't say stuff like that, it's not in the mood” Mr. Lazy raised his hand and pointed to the others drinking, their cheers. Mr. Angry's driving was starting to become unstable. Mr. Melancholy saw Mr. lazy's finger pointing around, like the telescope of a submarine poking around new territory.</p>
<p>“It took me a long time to learn that she was the one” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I saw her first, so it must mean that she's the one I really love”</p>
<p>“Who cares” Mr. Lazy said. “Love, or not, it doesn't matter anymore. My wife's waiting for me back there, but I'm on my way somehwere else in this rickety bus. We're travelling for six hours and then saying bye. Don't talk to me about love, it doesn't mean anything”</p>
<p>“What are you two saying?” Mr. Purple said. Her voice had degraded into one of those speeches where the microphones keeping swingin around and only certain words are amplified.</p>
<p>“About who we saw waiting for us”</p>
<p>“I saw God” Mr. Purple said. “How about you?” She nudged Mr. Angry, it was full of so muhc force that she almost puked, and he curved the steering wheel of the bus. It was already bent into a circle, but he bent it even more so that he couldn't drive it easily.</p>
<p>“Who I saw? I saw the cold air” Mr. Angry said. “That's all I saw nowadays. And money, rainign down from inside it”</p>
<p>“You're so vain” she said, “Who cares about money, you're the only one who cares, are you happy now that you saved your face and your pride from that GM? There's more to it than just how much money you make ”</p>
<p>“I'm very happy” he smiled.</p>
<p>“Did you hear what happened to Mr. Danger?” Mr. Chatterbox said. Now she had also moved to the back so that only Mr. Purple and Mr. Angry were at the front of the bus.</p>
<p>“He died right?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Yes, but do you know how?” She tried to get close to Mr. Melancholy and rub his arm. She was really afraid right now and wanted some comfort, he was so cold to her, she had no friends apart from him right now.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy responded and held her hand. She smiled in response, and her story grew warm and almost funny.</p>
<p>“Apparently Mr. Danger was a spy, and he decided to do what was right or whatever and stop the heist, but there was no conviction, he pulled the trigger slow, way too slow on the guard who walked past. Who happened to be your wife Mr. Lazy. He missed, and Mr. Angry saw he was a spy and personally went up to him and shot him in the face point blank. He fired one bullet in each eye, then immediately called up and reported that there was an accident. Mr. Danger is gay right? And his boyfriend worked as a housekeeper, Mr. Angry knew this and reported for that guy to clean it up. The guy must have thought it was his lucky day to be specially asked for. So he came up the elevator I guess, and he came along the corridor and just saw this bloody mess, mixed into the red carpet like it was the same thing. He didn't know where the blood ended and his lover began. He had cleaning equipment, but he wasn't ready to deal with a corpse. Not the corpse of his loved one. Then he turned him over nad saw two empty holes for eyes...”</p>
<p>“Now you're just making it up” Mr. Lazy said. </p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox grinned, “You're right, sorry, I'm just imagining it now, but it's true Mr. Angry shot him. Who would have guessed Mr. Danger was a spy.”</p>
<p>“But we're fine now right?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Don't worry, we'll be fine, Mr. Angry's got out backs” Mr. Chatterbox said. “But what do you think about what Mr. Angry did? Making your loved one witness it. The housekeeper ran up, he looked at the corpse with a blank look, then it took him a while to identify It as his boyfriend. He had the ring in his pocket for a proposal. With the eyes gone it was kind of difficult, but he saw him and broke down on to the ground like a breakdance. He became completely helpless.”</p>
<p>“There's nothing worse” she said.</p>
<p>“Oh there is” Mr. Chatterbox said, “I can think of a lot worse”</p>
<p>“Okay., stop there” Mr. Melancholy cupped her mouth. She pretended to struggle, but actually she enjoyed it, she felt close with her boyfriend again. And she didn't say it, but she was happy that he couldn't meet Charlotte any more, now he was all hers to take care of.</p>
<p>This was when, if it could be put down to a moment, that Mr. Melancholy lost his respect for Mr. Angry. The others had lost their respect for their leader long ago, but now the last force supporting Mr. Angry had wavered and turned away from a trickle, into flowing the other way. Mr. Melancholy saw something inherently wrong in Mr. Angry, somerhting that the world should never see. Maybe it was something the others had already seen long ago.</p>
<p>“You guys talking about Mr. Danger?” Mr. Angry said, they heard him slap Mr. Purple's butt. And she reacted in revolution. “He was a rat, a fucking liar, so I shot him dead”</p>
<p>Mr. Purple laughed, and then Mr. Angry laughed as well, their laughter fueled each other's. Mr. Angry, unbeknowest, turned to Mr. Melancholy, expecting a good laugh or joke, or support, but he only saw a blank confusion wirtten on Mr. Melancholy's face, it was unacceptable, he had gone too far. The bus swerved and he turned back to straighten it back in place on the road. He kept glancing in the mirror at Mr. Melancholy.</p>
<p>“You're an idiot though Mr. Lazy” Mr. Angry said, “During the heist you stuck the finger up at the camera, I know you did”</p>
<p>“You saw that?” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox reported it to me. You did something extra at the risk of having us get caught. I should have shot you right there as well.” Mr. Angry said. “Someone could have immediately noticed it, you know every camera is watched all the time and you still did it.”</p>
<p>“I was just having some fun” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>“The plan was supposed to be perfect, but you made it not even 90%, it was 85% okay, if nothing happened. Something always can happen though, so actually we don't know.” Mr. Angry said. “You jeopardized all of our efforts with your stupid spontaneous expression of free will. Good job, good fucking job Mr. Lazy. What would your wife think if you came back to her in a coffin? That's the end of the line you know, people go a long way before becoming into that state, but you just made it instantly”</p>
<p>“Shut the fuck up, I know what a coffin is, and you're a short stubby dick” Mr. Lazy said.</p>
<p>William was coming to this conclusion himself, and it's the same conclusion Mr. Angry said. And he knew it was because Daniel came to this conclusion that he had come to this one as well. Even now, he felt worthless in front of Daniel.</p>
<p>Hotel is very busy during the day, long lines, fast working, and not much money being made:</p>
<p>Memories II:</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy sat back and the bus disappeared, he was talking to Laura. A tear streamed down his eye, he didn't know if he'd see her again.</p>
<p>She was talking, “Stealing a huge amount of money, it's not stealing someone's money anymore, it's stealing the trust that everyone put into the hotel, that's what they're stealing, something much more important than possession. And that makes it different, quantity does change things, because who has the right to take someone else's trust?”</p>
<p>Then he joked, and said that by stealing all of the trust, they can get everyone's trust, right?</p>
<p>But she was appalled at his logic and the way he was thinking, and he wondered why none of the others cared when they were stealing this. Is it normal not to care, is she weird for caring and being concerned about it?</p>
<p>Then he said something that he regretted now, it was mean. “You women are always thinking too much, just relax for a second okay? Just go home and listen to what I have to say when I get back.” </p>
<p>He was such a fool, he wasn't coming back.</p>
<p>At this point she dropped her smoke on her skinny dress, didn't care, and went off. Her dress was white and with flowers all over it, really beautiful fabric, and her figure was exquisite. What Mr. Happy didn't know was that she had dressed for him, her shoes were hard to walk in, but she hadn't worn them for herself today. And her hair hadn't been done up because she just 'felt like it', no, he was such a jerk. At the time he was feeling last minute anxiety about what they are doing, it was the normal panic right before a performance.</p>
<p>Instead, he bragged to everyone he met that his motto was to be able to throw everything away instantly. Just like the other members were saying. They heard each other and copied. He bragged that he knew what was most important to him, and no woman or no job, or nothing would take that away from him. He thought he was so firm in his belief that no one else could sway him. He was repeating what was said at the meeting to her.</p>
<p>Yet, he remembered when people around him, his friends, and strangers on the street asked him what this important thing was, he was surprisingly vague about it and didn;t make much sense. Then it was clear to everyone that he didn't know what he wanted, he talked about action instead of words, that's why he was able to brag about throwing things away, because he had nothing to throw away. but he was the biggest candidate, . And everyone saw that he was lost, but him, and everyone told him to accomplish something, except himself. He liked to hear the advice, it was all attention. He finally saw what they saw. A lost and awkward man who was running on a treadmill and calling that progress.</p>
<p>“Mr. Danger was really interesting though” Mr. Chatterbox said. “He was a character, I wish he was here”</p>
<p>“Were here” Mr. Purple corrected her Grammar like a boss.</p>
<p>“Sorry, were here” She was still thinking about it. </p>
<p>“I hired him” Mr. Angry said, he was a lot more open now that the heist was over and was recalling how they first met. “I stood up and  told him he would be contacted. Then he came to the hotel foyer area and met everyone for the first time, it was really intense”</p>
<p>“Then you asked me to call him!” Mr. Chatterbox said, “And I did, I did. I called him up and he asked awkwardly into the phone....interrupting my long explanation..Umm...is this the person who was supposed to contact me?”  Mr. Chatterbox held her hand against her ear and pretended to talk into the phone. She looked cute to Mr. Melancholy. </p>
<p>Memories III: Mr. Chatterbox on da phone here</p>
<p>“I didn't know what he meant, so I asked him, what do you mean sorry?”</p>
<p>“I mean, are you the... You will be contacted guy?”</p>
<p>“Oh...I think so...? You're the new recruit with a shaved head right”</p>
<p>He looked in the mirror, his  head was shaven, that was correct.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that's probably me”</p>
<p>“We run the contact agency, so we contact all the people who are supposed to be contacted, if you know what I mean...”</p>
<p>“Umm yeah. Wait what, wait...sorry...what do you mean?”
“Sigh”</p>
<p>“Did you say sigh? Who does that?”</p>
<p>“Okay, I'm going to hang up, a different person will call you.”</p>
<p>Gerry felt like an idiot, he was never good with phones.</p>
<p>Then the phone rang and an attractive woman voice started talking. And when she talked it was a similar feeling to hiking up a steep rocky mountain all the clouds on the mountain were pushed aside and he could see all of the scenery below.</p>
<p>This was a woman's voice? How come he had never heard one before?</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” she said.</p>
<p>“If you hug me” he said, “I'll do anything you say. Right now that is the only payment I want. Just hug me for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Me too” she said, “Just hug me for a long time”</p>
<p>And she didn't say it, but this man was her first crush here, before William. Until she found out he was a gay man. Then she needed to switch her attention.</p>
<p>Women were able to manipulate men, with a smile and with things. But here she wasn't doing so, she was being honest and truthful. That was how people should be.</p>
<p>She imagined a funny scenario, what if when they got to the GM's room, they noticed that instead of all sorts of things everywhere, and the one legendary woman, there were five hundred women who were all smiling and gentle. But they churned through them like cream, based on the descriptions, how someone like her must have been, and how she must be now, because some things could not be changed, and some things in a person could not be changed no matter how much time passed, they would remain there forever. Then they finally found her, and took the chastity belt.</p>
<p>They tried to identify this woman through hundreds of women here all wearing chastity belts, based on what Mr. Angry said about her. How she did this and that, she had these certain mannerisms, and she was so talkative. Based on his loose romantic perceptions of her, they had to find her themselves. Then Charlotte met her in real life and finally saw what he was saying. So she was actually like this...</p>
<p>Essentially, it was a test of communciation, to see how sincerely people could communicate things to others, and how much of it was taken in by the other person. And it was also a test of sincerity and how close people could be. When Mr.Chatterbox found her, it meant that he had drawn closer, not to her, but to Mr. Angry. And this thought mades her feel proud.</p>
<p>This woman had no experience with men, not at all, not in the slightest, but the GM allowed her to experience it with women, because he didn't feel betrayed by it. Every time she mentioned someone else, he felt like their love was not important anymore. The GM bought her for the legend, he bought perfection, but he didn't know anything about her, before she became perfect, and while she was still normal. She only talked about the women she had been with, so he showed her a woman who was different, Mr. Purple. And that was the connection between them.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fifty-charlotte">fifty: Charlotte: <AFTER></h3>
<p>Finally, Charlotte learned of the heist happening, she woke up and alarms were running throughout the place, like that time when she went in to the temples of South East Asia. And she sat patiently and waited and hoped to hear the news that William was fine, he was working in a dangerous area. She sat in her room and covered her ears and prayed, the way she had always prayed since young, hoping that nothing would happen to her dear loved one. She had chosen him herself and decided to give herself to him, no matter if he cheated, he was the best man she had ever known in hard to describe ways. But then she uncovered her ears and the alarms are so loud, he said he would come back here, so she would wait. She keeps praying, but the longer she prays and heard the alarms ringing she started to panic more. The deafening loudness of the alarms was crazy, how could she say this so much? Was he really okay? He was involved with all this commotion, she saw the highly trained officers running past with guns, and she teared up, how could he possibly survive this? What had he done to make the whole hotel on lockdown and these scary men run out with dangerous weapons.</p>
<p>Then she took her hands off her ears again, and it was a miracle, the alarms had finally stopped ringing, the world has returned to normal. She thanked her prayers and God.</p>
<p>And then she heard running down the corridor, her heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>But it wasn't William, her friend came running in, panting and telling her to evacuate.</p>
<p>“Some people stole things, huge gold bars, and this chastity belt thing, I never knew we had one of those, everyone's talking about it now, look outside!”</p>
<p>“Who did it” Charlotte said. She felt an uneasyness how William still wasn't back.</p>
<p>“A few of the guys were caught on camera.”</p>
<p>In her mind it was a coincidence, William promised to be back, and he would never do something like that. She trusted him. It was okay to put all of her trust in him right? He would always be there for her. He said so.</p>
<p>The clouds staretd to rain, but the alarms started up again, more policemen left, they found the traces of a bus with wet tires and started heading afetr it. The other officers scouted the GM, he was in a shock, everything he had invested in had been taken from him. He didn't have energy to stand, or even speak. The doctor noted that his condition was not dissimilar to those suffered by victims of PTSD.</p>
<p>When Charlotte finally learned of William's involvement she was devastated, she didn't know what she could trust anymore. It seemed like everything he told her was a lie and he actually didn't care about her at all. This realization came after he had gone with the money and his ambition. Then she realized what she was to him, just sex, just another vagina that happened to talk and nag him all day.</p>
<p>If it was a vagina, she was the same as all of the other women he had been with. He only recognized her through the feel of her vagina, otherwise he doesn't know who she was. She realized this after he was inside her but never dared to admit it. Sometimes they would meet and he woudlnt' know her name, she never asked, she thought it would pass. After he inserted, he suddenly kenw who she was, it was always like this.</p>
<p>Then she cried, she had promised someone that she wouldn't cry. The last time she cried was when she was five years old. She promised ot not cry again and trust him. Now she was crying hard, she collapsed on all fours on the carpet, bawling out her fast rhythm. Her friend was still in the dorrway on tip toes and asked her what was wrong. But Charlotte was gone, she was completely depressed and crying, “I'm so sad” she said, “Help me, I'm so sad”</p>
<p>“What can I do” Her friend kneeled down and hugged Charlotte but the tears didn't stop, and her friend felt like crying as well. </p>
<p>“I'm pregnant” Charlotte said, rubbing her tummy, “And it's his baby. I was excited to tell him the news when he came back.”</p>
<p>“I'm pregnant as well” the friend said, “But I don't know who's baby it is, I slept with five guys, but I chose which one the father should be, so I didn't tell him, because the real father probably has no money. But this guy has a compassionate heart, and I know that if I speak to him for long enough, and close enough, and cry enough, he will turn to help me, no matter what. If I can just get close enough to him then it will happen”</p>
<p>Charlotte stared at her friend. “No, I didn't mean that at all, Too much information”</p>
<p>“Oh sorry” he friend said, “I thought it was that kind fo sharing moment”</p>
<p>“It was Charlotte said, “But not that...Oh my gosh, that's a whole different level of problems okay? But this chapter is for me” </p>
<p>“Sorry, yeah, I apologize, won't happen again. But I was manipulating one of the guys, and I was completely shameless about it. Suddenly when things turn bad for me I'm conveniently pregnant and and 'forgot' to mention it to anyone previously. It's one of our last weapons we have.” she said.</p>
<p>“You create such a negative view of women” Charlotte said, “I think jhafl of the negativity about women in the world comes from you. Not everyone is like you, you know. I feel like one day I will wake up from this dream and realize my thinking was always misogynistic, based on a fear, and I will feel ashamed to be so.”</p>
<p>Then her friend also started crying, because she never expected such an unfortunate turn of events. “So your man isn't even here? No you're not, you can't be.”</p>
<p>Charlotte hesitated, then she smiled, “Yeah sorry, I was just joking” She smiled and wiped her tears away. “Don't mind me”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fifty-one-mr-lazy">fifty one: Mr. Lazy <AFTER></h3>
<p>Mr. Lazy closed his eyes and he was lying on a distant shore somewhere. Everything he heard reminded him of leaving, just always leaving and going somewhere else, it was like he couldn't stop leaving. He didn't remember the arrivals, only the leaving, it was a constant pulse in his body, like a heart beat. There was no way to rid the rhythm of progress wanted or unwanted.</p>
<p>After the heist he stole the money and things went wrong, so he ran to his woman. He was running down the road with a big sports bag, in it were sheets and sheets of bloody money. Someone had been killed over it, he didn't dare look inside, he just ran to his woman. She always supported him, and right she was the only one who could. Even after saying he didn't need her, she was still waiting for him. In the house facing the window and looking at the mountains anxiously. They had their own woman, mate. A person they found in the foggy land that understood them and could relate to them, perhaps slightly more than someone else. And sometimes these people even supported them without trying to change them. </p>
<p>He knocked on her door, then gently pushed it open, he had done it so many times before, but this time he knew it was the last. It was the opposite of the hectic lifestyle of what was happening earlier, in this door everything was always slow and a lot more quiet, he enjoyed the quietness of it. Especially right now, when he coudln't seem to find a sip of it. He went in the door then he said goodbye. He said goodbye to her, and she already knew something had gone wrong, she sensed it with a woman's instinct. Like it was an extra sense that had been programmed into her. And then he left and outside she heard shouting and yelling, she covered herself with the covers, and the towel still wet from the shower that she prepared to see him.</p>
<p>His last words were that he was sorry. All this time she had been pleading for him to just admit his mistake already, that he did wrong but she wasn't upset about it. But when he finally apologized, she didn't feel good at all. It just made her feel worse, because he was always so sure of himself, and now he's being taken away for life. If he was making such a big decision like this, she wished he would at least be confident and sure of it...He was so sure for as long as she knew him. He didn't hesitate, he led her places. But now he wasn't, and it was discomforting to see this core part of him missing. She almost felt like running out of the house to find it back for him. Or maybe if she hugged him for long anough and tight enough it would return. This thing with a strange name. </p>
<p>“I know” she said, it turned out that she knew all the time he was lying, but never said it, because confronting him about it killed her. She knew he was doing his best, and he had been trying his best, but some part of her was angry that he would even consider this, and she felt bad for being angry at him. Because she has so much morals. “I'm bad” she said, “I should be supportive of you, but I can't be supportive of this”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fifty-two-at-the-very-end-the-aftermath">fifty two: At the very end: The Aftermath</h3>
<p>Mr.Lazy's eyes opened, his head was banging against the back of the seat on the bus. They were speeding and entering one of the close towns.  He saw the bag with the chastity belt in it and remembered what they were doing now.</p>
<p>They stole this huge thing, then ran out, but didn't sense anyone chasing, then they went away and the hotel was still standing, like a skeleton with its innards removed. On the long stretch of grass they stopped the car, there was no need to run, the hotel still operated. The lights were flickering like they always did. There was no change, this huge heist had been prepared and happened, and nothing changed. They could run away from the scene, or walk away, no one really cared. It didn't really matter. It was like someone was asking them, “Would you like to run, or would you like to walk? Or you can just stay here and think about it if you feel you need to”</p>
<p>“Why is there no response?” Mr. Purple said. And when she said it, it felt like something really was wrong, she was the calmest woman who he didn't think thought about that. “It's like they don't mind losing this”</p>
<p>“It's uncomfortable, like all this time we were so seriously planning and plotting, and we stole, and we had our fun, and we're leaving. They really don't mind”</p>
<p>They could split up here and try to forget this from their memory, it was disgusting. Mr.Chatterbox walked away saying that the money is disgusting, she didn't even want it, yet her bag had been zipped up carefully and taped shut with thick cellotape. She kept on saying that it was disgusting dirty money, but she didn't let go of it.</p>
<p>“Why aren't they chasing us, isn't it weird?” Mr. Melancholy said.</p>
<p>“The world was supposed to change, fireworks, or huge cop cars, or something, any change, chains on our arms.” he said. “We're supposed to be running and in danger”</p>
<p>“Why don't you give us the money then, if you don't want it” Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>“Why don't you shut the fuck up, what I do is none of your business, all of you used me anyway.” Mr. Chatterbox said. “We've all been used here, by someone, it isn't even clear who.</p>
<p>“All you do is complain about how bad this is, but when someone tries to help you, you accuse them and defend yourself.”</p>
<p>Now people were all saying things.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy was back in his house, he kept circling to this memory. He knew that he had been caught, and they would see it was him who did it. Then he heard shouting outisde, they had come to get him, and then the door to staff dining behind him opened, a bright light came through. He didn't recognize this person's face.</p>
<p>Then he pictured his wife, was she going to be there watching him and saying bye? When he got home she was waiting with soft lips and a smile. She was clueless, she still didn't realize he had done it, that he was guilty. And he wanted her soft embrace, because if he was hugged by her for long enough then maybe it would come true.</p>
<p>For her, it was so quiet, too quiet. She just knew something had happened somewhere here today, and it wasn't good news.</p>
<p>Then he saw her, the girl he always judged wrongly, the girl he never trusted, but should have from the very start, the girl who was always supportive of him and wanted the best of him. She was standing on the side, by herself, apart from the crowd around him, and watching him. And he looked down at his wrists, they were wrapped in chains, cuffs, then finally, after everything,he finally regrets his decision, he finally regrets ever doing something as stupid and worthless as this.</p>
<p>The man ran to the place they were supposed to meet, they finally figure out that he was Gerry's boyfriend. </p>
<p>“Where's Gerry, he said he would be back?”</p>
<p>Then he got the call to clean the room, “Act calm, don't frighten the customers” he kept telling himself.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? What is it, can I contact you back?”</p>
<p>“This is urgent, we have the whole team working on it.” his boss said, “We're cleaning up a mess”</p>
<p>Then the man walked through the corridor to see his lover sprawled on the ground.</p>
<p>Then the bright light fades and the dark doors shut in front of him. The car drove off, and he was left alone to suffer in the silence he had wrought on himself. His ears were ringing and he coudln't hear anything properly, he couldn't close his eyes, he was in a state of constant irritation and anxiety. Like a guitar newly tuned.</p>
<p>He was the only one caught, the others hadn't been caught.</p>
<p>Fifty Three:</p>
<p>Everyone was talking about it, before, after, during, and waiting for the others to arrive, or just got off the bus and ask around about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry stopped the bus at an empty road with empty grass blowing in the wind. No matter how far they travelled, it was the same scenery, the same grass blown by a different wind.</p>
<p>“Have some wine” he passed it around on the picnic mat he laid out. “Everyone's talking about us now” he said, “And then after she was talking, the heist became a word of mouth, and we changed from unknown figures into glorious monsters who could not be challenged. People around were were shaped like wizards, and they looked to these men and this point in time with a certain legendary nostalgia. It's happened” he said, “We've become legends, you can look yoruself up, your characteristics, what people think of you, it's all written down now. You're not a stranger”</p>
<p>“If I'm not a stranger” Mr. Melancholy said, “Why do I feel so worthless? I'm supposed to not be unknown anymore”</p>
<p>“A stranger doesn't do things like what I just did” Mr. Angry was bragging, his threshold had been reached. “I was touching the treasure” he said. “In places no man has ever been. That woman is mine”</p>
<p>“But why didn't you steal the belt?”</p>
<p>“I went up to her” Mr. Angry said, he had gone up to her in the other room, he saw it clearly, he took her, and unlocked the belt, and it was really sweaty, but he did the deed, impregnated her, then locked the belt back up again, almost as if he has never been here. He didn't steal anything, he didn't take the belt, he just planted something and left it the same and disappeared. A generous man who left something here in the middle of the day. </p>
<p>The woman was so beautiful that she was kept hidden from the world, and she had never learned to speak, or to moan, or to react. She was just occupying space, and a lot of space in lonely mens' thoughts. But now the flowering period had finished and the petals would drop and a fruit would grow, half of it was a most fantastical beautiful woman in the world, and half was a monster, a deep dark beast that had no sympathy or care for the world and desired to rip it apart. It was just finding some place to plant its claws into. In some ways they were both very similar.</p>
<p>All these years he saw other women who resembled her a tiny bit, and then he became disappointed, because up close they were all so inevitably different, and they just reminded him of her, the most perfect woman.</p>
<p>“You can't think like that, all women are different, none are perfect, they are all different.” People told him.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry, or Daniel, whichever you'd like to call him, laughed. “Trust me, if you see her, you'll know, there's no creature in the world like her, no similar species, she's perfect.And yet she can't reproduce with anyone and completely alone, the last of her kind, a wild card in the gene pool.”</p>
<p>She called him superficial. He said she was correct, but that didn't make her any more right.</p>
<p>Mr. Angry in the end, probably did it all for the pride. Because that, to him, was worth more than money. One day the GM would come back and realize that she was pregnant, even though she was still wearing the chastity belt that could not be undone by any man. </p>
<p>Mr. Angry had always been confused, he could take the belt and make money, because he didn't have the key, or he could feel good in knowing he had been here first, to the woman that every man falls asleep thinking about, he is here right now, with her, and she is willing.</p>
<p>And once again, he came to the realization that confidence was rarer than money. Because you can't buy it and you can't spend it, it lives in accordance with people. Especially after he gave it away to Mr. Purple.</p>
<p>The GM might have thought she was a virgin birth. But more likely, he would know that someone had been there before him, and been with his woman before he had. He always wanted to claim her, but he kept on waiting, because he was afraid that afetr claiming her she wouldn't be worth as much to the world. And if she wasn't worth it to the world, she probably wasn't to him either.</p>
<p>And then he would realize that this woman is not really his anymore. And that his when he will feel a deep dark sadness that goes beyond anger or human emotions, this is a dive into a place that cannot be returned, Mr.Angry wanted to make the GM feel the same way that he once did. And when you go too deep one day you won't be able to come back out. Or even if you do, you will be changed forever.</p>
<p>It was the loss of familiarity in something so close to you. A very specific experience that Mr. Angry was trying to recreate, and he did it in the only way he could imagine possible.Mr. Angry wanted to take her, but he didn't, to others it was always strange why. But now, after seeing her again, he realized what it was. She used to be normal, before she became perfect. It was something to do with that.</p>
<p>She said she didn't start the war, that everyone was so annoying and running around her. She didn't want so many people to die, it wasn't her intention. He went over and stroked her hair gently, he told her sincerely that he didn't mind what she started or didn't start as long as she hadn't gained any weight.</p>
<p>And she looks up at him with admiring eyes, he's the nicest man she has ever known. He will kill anyone for her and do anything for her. He really loves hes truly. He doesn't mind all of her flaws, as long as she doesn't gain weight. It was an easy way of maintaining a love.</p>
<p>She was so beautiful that she can do and say anything that she wants and others can't resist her, most of the time she had whatever she wanted. He kept her in this room, satisfied with the small world she saw.</p>
<p>No one knew this, none of those on the bus, or the GM, but she wrote a story, and it showed her passion and creativity. </p>
<p>Her story was written in a notebook among all of her other things. She was a kid in woman's clothing and with a woman's body. She laughed all day and didn't know responsibilities. And she wrote a woman's story about trying to change a man, it ran in parallel with a dog. Women were always trying to change men, to tame them to fit themselves, and then judging which problems need solving and which don't. And they are excited by the challenge of trying to change the man, and the prospects of being in control of him. And didn't understand that it's offensive to a man. Men chase as well, they don't understand as well.
And then the second part of the story was that a man was always trying to run away, he tried to catch a woman, and then run away before he was caught. It was a conflict that always took place. It wasn't even surprising anymore. 
And in conclusion, a woman's body, the back half of it is made to be held by a man, it's like if it doesn't happen then nothing happens. And she felt like she had a life unfulfilled, she didn't know what, but it seemed that way. A universal truth, one of the few that was known.</p>
<p>Then, there was a man's story about him always trying to make a woman have it his way, to not complain and just do what she is supposed to, and then it all goes along like that, and everything is happening all the time.</p>
<p>Then, there was also a story of women, and how he  a man cheered them on and was so supportive of them, protects them and hopes that they enjoy their lives. And trust that they will always come back to him because they respect him as well.</p>
<p>She had these stories lying around the room. But no one realized their worth. And they were left there. Perhaps they didn't need to be told, why did they need to be validated by someone else?</p>
<p>Fifty Four:</p>
<p>As they all sat around the picnic mat they slowly realzied one by one that nothing ahd changed. No matter how big they planned, or how much they tried, nothing really changed in the end. And it wasn't difficult to keep finding that fabric that went through their lives. It was shaped like clothing, and it felt like something special and unique to each of them. But before and after the heist, it was like nothing had changed, they were still telling the same nonsense stories.</p>
<p>Mr. Melancholy stopped calling himself that, he was William. He felt like even after everything, after making his comrades happy and making themselves happy, he didn't feel like he had achieved anything, even beyond this, in all of life, William Weng, he said he felt like all of his accomplishments were worth nothing. And all his life he was running away from it to get away, but still couldn't anymore. With that William Weng signed out.</p>
<p>“Okay I'm leaving here” Mr. Purple got up and smoothed out her dress. There was nothing around her, just more mountains and grass. “I'm gonna go”</p>
<p>“Where to?”</p>
<p>“I don't know” she looked back and smiled, the wind hit her hair and body in a shudder, but she managed to stay up. “I might start a new life somewhere here” </p>
<p>Mr. Lazy was sad to say bye to Mr. Purple,she was a wonderful woman, but in the end he knew he had to, because otherwise she wouldn't go anywhere, and he wouldn't go anywhere. If it's meant to be, she was so perfect, and amazing, and kind, and enjoyed nature, like he did, and quiet and shy, yet so gentle. Like he was. If it was meant to be, then they would meet again. They could leave it to fate to sort out.</p>
<p>“I'm going to travel around the world seven times with this fortune” Mr. Lazy said for the first time. “I want to experience what light feels like when it travels seven times around in a second”. It was ironic, because when they escaped, they were sightseeing the place for the first time.</p>
<p>“I'm going to hold on to it” Mr. Chatterbox said. </p>
<p>William was going to hold onto it too. </p>
<p>“For womanizing?” they remaining members joked. “Hold on to your virginity?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chatterbox is going to buy herself a husband, a true love, her other half soulmate.”</p>
<p>She laughed as well, she didn't say anything much, she didn't take the question seriously.</p>
<p>“Mr. Angry will destroy the world, so we won't be able to do anything anyway with this money.”</p>
<p>They said this kind of thing, but in reality the money was very dirty and they hated it.</p>
<p>He remembered following the porters around as they took the luggage to the rooms, knocking on doors and saying 'porter' and waiting for a response, unlocking the door if there was no response.</p>
<p>Then he remembered his boss later heard about it, it was crazy he talked all about it, his boss had heard all about the private actions outside work. </p>
<p>Mr. Lazy remembered one of the meetings, Mr. Angry had brought someone in, with an open hand,“Let me introduce you to Lanny, he was another character who was very prominent, and they had already heard a lot about him. Apparently he could change their whole situation. He had the superpower to identify every bad person instantly, and he could solve their problems, if at any time during the heist there was a problem, they should contact him. Mr. Lazy wondered if they could still contact him now.</p>
<p>“So he can kill us? No thanks.” Mr. Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>“He's not going to kill you, he's going to solve your problems.” Mr. Angry said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazy remembered seeing Mr. Angry lie through his teeth, his tongue was slimy like a snake, there was no way he was telling the truth. </p>
<p>But Mr. Chatterbox believed him, and so did Mr. Lazy, they felt strong and invulnerable. “Okay, we'll do that” they didnt' say it like that, but they felt that way. Even if Mr. Melancholy had told them the truth that Mr. Angry was untrustworthy, they wouldn't have changed their minds.</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox remembered meeting him, how they first hung out, and how she was so hopeful something might happen, it was one of those rare planned romances. Their romance started, then they discussed what it was that they had, and they kept moving forward.</p>
<p>The talking developed into dating, then a proposal came. Like an instruction manual, all of the timings were correct She reads in her manual how it usually takes from two to three weeks, depending on the man's background and the woman's background, and how much time before babies. On her birthday, she pictured what she was doing last year at this time, the same things as today, and she felt depressed that there was no progress in her life. And she felt like she needed to make some progress for next year. She might have a baby with this man. Just for some evidence of change, for her family and friends, and for herself.</p>
<p>But instead of a romance, she had gotten involved in this heist, and instead of worrying about daily life, she became worried of the risks. What if it went wrong? (Make the part where he does the heist really different)</p>
<p>Then she stopped looking at him, she knew that this thing they had would last a long time, her life. She didn't know how many dozens of time she would be talking about it. Because she had someone else now, she didn't need to mind him. And he wondered that what if she didn't have anyone else, would she be looking at him now? And had she stopped looking at a different guy after she met him? He was just another one in line right? She told him he didn't need to worry, as long as she wasn't worried and insecure about him., she wouldn't cheat. So cheating, this big bad thing, was only managed by her insecurity, and not by her self control or moderation? That didn't seem right did it? And he wondered if she actually liked him, she always says she does, and she wasn't lying. But, if you love someone you can't cheat right?</p>
<p>Mr. Chatterbox looked down at some crackers with cheese and vegemite and smiled, she was going to miss this, it was fun and amazing, but she had to go on, take the next step in life. She stood up, and smoothed out her skirt. She was going to look for another romance, she knew what she wanted, she had the funds. “One day you'll hear about me” she said, “So I won't say bye now”</p>
<p>She was with a man who cared for her and took care of her sweetly.</p>
<p>One time, during her break at work, for ten minutes, she sat in the bathroom by herself, smoking and dropping it into the inside of it. She didn't know how she felt about it all yet, but it was a strange feeling. And the silence wrapped around her, everything seemed so interesting and mentally stimulating, everything was so vivid right now, like her third eye had opened.</p>
<p>One time, after work, William was sitting in the bathroom while everyone else was surrounding and so close. But there were no cameras here, and he could do anything he wanted. He was sitting there and planning the destruction of the hotel while work was going on. While folding shirts, he thought about this short break and became excited. He walked into the bathroom and immediately sat down and planned how things were going to work, and how to do things here. He was smoking in the bathroom cubicle, the only peace he could get where no one was bothering him. It was a short ten minutes break from work. Its the last break he would have, it was actually happening this afternoon. He was nervous just thinking about it. He had said goodbye to everyone he needs to, but it was painful because he couldn't say bye properly. And he couldn't tell them why he was saying bye.</p>
<p>For some reason this memory came to William at this moment. He chuckled, and stood up, he waved bye to the two reminaing members and left.</p>
<p>Shortly later, Mr. Lazy and Mr. Angry parted ways here. None of it was planned.
They disappeared into the land like seeds on the trees. Each of them was different, but becaue they ahd met each other they had changed, maybe for the better, or for the worse, or just nothing so specific as change. They would go on to meet different people, live different lives,a nd share stories and intimacies with different people. This moment right here would disappear for them as well. And the heist would become a thing fo the past that they remembered with different feelings each time.</p>
<p>With that, Mr. Melancholy signed out. </p>
<p>Maybe they would meet each other again. </p>
<p>Maybe they wouldn't.</p>

<h3 id="postscript">Postscript:</h3>
<p>With this work I aimed for something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Post-fiction: Using words as ambience and instruments of thinking rather than semantic contents within themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story was supposed to be finished by January 2016, but due to unforeseen delays, life changes, it was delayed by about five months and is my longest yet, at about 230,000 words. (228,000 to be precise) So much ahs changed in my life, last year I moved 4 times and had three different jobs, one of them was my first. And in that year I wrote 2 and a half novels. Then started UNI here and met new people as well. 
I wish that this novel remains a collection of my feelings and emotions of the time, and I can come back to it, as the start or end of a departure!!!</p>
<p>Even so, it is nothing compared to the size of the universe and the vast amount of unoccupied space.
If this novel fills a little more of that space, even in the most tiny form, then I feel it has succeeded. I hope it's like an atom that repeats itself again and again until it becomes something more than an atom.</p>
<p>Thank you, I hoep you enjoy/enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing/feeling it.</p>
<p>gieoon.  </p>
