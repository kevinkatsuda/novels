### Chapter One
 
I fell through the clouds, then the air slowed around me and I came to a halt above the ground.
 
I never thought I would be back here again. A world of hierarchy based on levels and quests to fulfill. My hands felt real, and I could hear sounds. My senses were all digitally transferred here from the real world, but it felt incredibly real. I clenched my fist and watched as the blood disappeared, then let go and saw it flow back.
 
I was finally back.
 
Ten thousand people had been invited to test this new game out, we were all beta testers in this new environment, and were here before the game became ocommercial. All around me other players were also testing the system, it was amazing to see all of them here, each one as involved as I was.
 
"How old are you?" a fair haired girl said, she had finished choosing her clothing and was holding a huge sword in her hand. The name 'Casey' flashed above her head.
 
"I'm 17" I said, honestly. I felt like I was myself here, and it was all really happening. 
 
 "I'm the same" she said, "What a coincidence" I noticed her clothes, a small white skirt and low cut green spaghetti strap. "I'm from Christchurch, how about you?"
 
"I'm from Auckland" I said, "The North Shore"
 
"North Shore? You're a rich boy?" 
 
"Nah", I scratched my hair. "Anyway, do you know what's happening here?" I tried to sound casual, I never really got to talk to girls much.
 
She stared at me, "Don't you know? This is a big deal, you might miss dinner you know." 
 
"I know that" I laughed, "I've been here before" Just as I said that, a blonde woman stood on thin air and started speaking. Everyone started to gather around, some were amazed at how she was floating, Casey pushed me towards the crowd.
 
"Welcome everyone" the lady said, "My name is Israel, your host of this game, it's nice to meet you all and I hope we can all have a lot of fun together." There were a few shouts of agreement.
 
Israel went on, "Of course most of you are just here for sightseeing, we're in a beautiful spot and I understand that so please look and touch all you want, but for those of you looking for a challenge, then there is an extra bonus of levelling"
 
A few of the players nodded in agreement, there were definitely players here looking for more. 
 
"For the players to reach level 10, there is a special treasure that will be unlocked to them" Some of the guys shouted out in excitement.
 
"What is the treasure?" a guy asked in the front
 
Israel frowned, "I can't tell you that yet, but you'll find out, when you reach level 10 you complete the game, the reward is a complete game changer."
 
The group of guys in the front cheered and started chanting something.
 
Casey sighed, "Guys are so immature, they hear there's a reward and get so excited." She turned to me, "You're happy just being here right? We don't need to go for the reward"
 
I grinned, actually I was thinking of going for the reward as well. We could log out here any time, but since I was already here, I may as well go further.
 
I didn't log out there, but I should have, if I had known better I would have left this game as soon as I could.
 
Israel raised her hands to signify the start of the game, a huge beam shot up into the sky and carved the words "Welcome to your Virtual Reality" and then, "Start"
 
The crowd started to spread out gradually, people went to explore, and after a few hours the first players started logging out. Some people were getting bored of the whole experience, others had made friends and sat down on the grass talking to each other. Then, a few of the players had started leveling. They did this by attacking monsters that stood outside the gates. 
 
These monsters were easy to defeat, if you just swung your weapon they would fall, but they also didn't give much experience. The players who were leveling were planning to stay for a longer time, they probably didn't have much to do at home and had the time. 
 
I was going to look around a bit more and then go back to the real world and sleep early for school tomorrow.
 
That's when the first complaints started arising. Israel was still alive, so she was able to answer everyone's questions.
 
"Where do we go to leave?" a tall guy asked
 
"Why are we still here?" a group of girls asked,
 
We were supposed to be able to exit this world by going to the home area and holding the "Exit" button, but a warning message was appearing. Red words that flashed
 
"Unable to log out, original setting not working"
 
Israel could only offer one explanation. " 'Original setting', means the game itself" she said, "Maybe someone cheated, and the system has changed slightly, but enough to temporarily stop us from logging out"
 
"But I need to do one of my projects" Casey said, "When can I go back?" Israel was a computer generated figure, she only had certain responses programmed in her settings, but she tried her best.
 
"I will find out how long" she said.
 
"But I want to go back now" Casey said, she had a group of others gathering around her expecting the same. They all looked unhappy, Israel was not allowed to let her customers get upset.
 
"I will tell you when I know" she said...

### Chapter Two
 
(Add players flashing advertising)
 
The first players who arrived in this world were the programmers, they surveyed every inch of the world carefully and created the environment. How wonderful it must have been for them to arrive in this place that they had made from raw computer code.
 
The next arrivals were the shareholders in the game company, these were powerful men with huge amounts of money to spare. With a wave of a hand and a flick of a finger they could change the game's concept from one of peace to one of war. Because they were the ones funding the project they got to decide on all of the rules.
 
Many of the programmers were upset when they were forced to change what they had worked so hard on by the simple whims of these rich men, but there was no going against them.
 
When we started playing it wasn't clear, but somehow through the process of creation, cheat codes must have been implemented in the game. Or else they were bugs, every game had them, so it was only natural to think they were here as well.
 
But that was also troublesome.
 
A few of the players watched me as Israel explained this. I had played this game before and learnt it all myself, so I knew what was happening. During the beta stages of a game it is like a volcano going through an eruption, you never know what issues might arise.
 
One of the players raised his hand, "So you think this trouble now is because someone cheated in this world and we can't log out?"
 
I nodded, slowly. "Yes I think so" 
 
"Oh come on" a guy said, "I came here to test this game, they said it would be safe so I finally joined." He was instantly met with agreement and I didn't blame them, I felt the same way, this volatile situation was warned about before we joined, but still...
 
Israel put her finger on her lips. "Please wait a moment everyone, we are just trying to resolve the issue" she couldn't do much about the situation, but she was trying her best.
 
Most of the players were reasonable, they broke up into groups and started talking about it. I found myself with Casey and two others, a male player called Richard, and a female player called Elsie. Richard told me he was going to school in Hong Kong, and he had met Elsie briefly in real life. It was a complete coincidence that they were both here.
 
He asked me, "Who would have cheated? Would cheating stop us all from logging out?" 
 
 "Yes" I said, from what I knew, if one player had found a bug and manipulated it, then it would ruin the area that the glitch was based on, if it was a big enough glitch then the whole foundation of the game could be ruined."
 
"How about just logging us out manually?" Elsie said, "It's just like pulling a plug from a TV"
 
I really hoped so but it wasn't that easy, "If you pull the plug on your computer it damages the memory and hard drive. Now imagine our brains, packed with so many neurons and connections and highly active at the moment, if you pulled the plug on it, what would happen?"
 
Casey nodded, "It would be bad, very bad, memory loss?" She swung her sword around in the air. "So when can we get out?"
 
"It depends on how bad this cheat has affected the game right?" Richard said, "It could be done in the next five minutes, or it could take up to an hour" He looked at me for confirmation.
 
"It could take up to a day" I said, remembering some of the online games I had played and been unable to log out of and gotten frustrated with. They had been deliberately targeted and hacked by some low level players. But I didn't leave out the possibility of it taking longer, a lot longer.
A voice echoed through the area, everyone looked up to where it came from, now standing beside Israel was another player, he had the normal items that we had, except that he had the word 'Mod' lit up around his name, Warren in neon yellow. It was the symbol for a moderator. There weren't many of them around so we were lucky to have one in our midst.
 
"Sorry everyone, I just contacted the administrators and they are very upset over this occurrence, it seems like the glitch has affected the global aspect of our game so it would be extremely dangerous to try logging anyone out forcefully." He also had a weapon in his hand, a bow and arrow, the lowest level ones, but he held it like he had been using it for a long time.
 
"Warren" someone called Dazzy raised their hand
 
"Warren pointed with his bow, "Go ahead Dazzy"
 
"What is the glitch"
 
"It's still unknown, but we will try to fix it as soon as possible" Warren said. This got a lot of boos and some players threw worthless items at him onto the stage. It was what all corporate lawyers did, and never said the truth.
 
"But there is another way to leave this world" Warren said, the crowd hushed down to hear him out. "The first way is to log out, but the second is to win the game, and then everything you have will be reset and wiped out."
 
It was ironic that we had to try to win the game to get to reset ourselves. Richard put it well, "I have to become really good and win this game that I hate, just so I can leave it" I had never thought of it like that.
 
There was a problem here, a huge problem...
 
No one knew what the game was, or how to play it. Everyone just joined because they were looking for some fun, most players never even considered the game aspect.
 
"You win the game by reaching level 10" Israel said, if a voice could glitter, hers would have been doing so. "Just reach level 10, and you'll be able to log out, otherwise you have to wait for the glitch to be resolved."
 
I sighed, I guess I should start playing this game, that was what it was designed for, and right now that seemed like the easiest way out.
 
"Isn't it strange?" Elsie said to us, "If it was just a glitch they would ask us to wait and enjoy everything, they would make up some lie not to make us worry, so why are they saying we should play the game?"
 
"Is it advertising?" Richard said, "They did all of this to force us to play this game how it's supposed to be?"
 
"No of course not" Casey said, "It's because it's a much bigger problem than they can handle, so they want to distract us" Casey turned to me "What do you think Kin?"
 
I sighed, why did she have to bring it to me. I looked around the game to try and think of what we could do.
 
This wasn't the first time something like this was happening to me...
 
---

### Chapter Three
 
I thought it was a good idea to try and complete the game. The game wasn't very big, and once we completed it we would be able to get back. I knew I would have no troubles, I had a lot of game experience, Richard and Elsie both looked capable as well. They probably both played games a lot.
But Casey was an issue, she wasn't very good on her feet. If we did try to complete the game I would need to watch out for her.
 
Casey smiled at me, "What are you thinking Kin?"
"Nothing" I said, "What do you guys think about trying to complete this game?" Richard and Elsie stared back at me. 
 
"I guess we'll do it, I mean we came all the way here so we may as well challenge ourselves right?" Elsie nodded and looked at me with confidence, "We'll do it, but how about her?" She pointed to Casey.
 
Casey was lying on the floor moving her legs like an upside down bicycle in a yoga position. "I don't want to play" she said, "I'm tired, I'll just wait for the game to solve itself."
 
"So you're going to wait here?" Elsie said, "You're going to be all alone you know" It would be a lot more fun with Casey, even if it were just for a few hours till we completed the game.
 
"I think she's scared" Richard said, "This game is extremely realistic, the fights happen right in front of you, that might make it difficult"
 
"I'm not scared" Casey glared at us, she stopped her kicking and rolled over. "I don't really want to, but I'll come with you only if it's faster to get us out" 
 
"Don't worry Casey" Richard said, "I'll be here to help you out." Casey looked at Richard and smiled, it was her first time in this game, it was normal to be afraid.
 
"Thank you Richard, you're so sweet." She stood up and wielded her weapon in her belt then grinned, "Alright everyone let's go, I'm ready"
 
This game was about leveling up, each player started at level 1 then gradually progressed up the levels as they gained experience. To win the game you had to reach level 10, but your levels were reset to 1 if you died. 
 
We left the spawning town and moved to some creatures right outside the area. They were level 0 creatures used for training, if we defeated five of them we would move on to the next level. Then we needed to defeat five level 1 creatures, and the cycle became progressively harder.
 
The four of us stood in a line, we attacked the monsters easily and defeated them, they turned into little silver sparkles of glitter that dissipated into the air. I attacked first, followed by Richard, then Elsie, by this time the creature was weakened and Casey made the last hit. The experience for defeating the monster was shared equally among us, so we decided to do it this way. Casey cheered whenever she slashed a creature and it disappeared into those sparkles, she really loved it.
 
At this point I guessed that most of the other players were also trying to complete the game, I had no idea what was happening outside of our group of friends.
 
An hour later we wandered back to the spawning area to see if there was any progress. Richard and Casey both had things to do in the real world and were getting bored here, they wanted to leave.
 
There were far fewer people standing in the area now, about half of them had gone to level up like we were, the players left behind were either the lazy ones who couldn't be bothered, or those who were upset. Warren was dealing with these players, trying to make them wait. I felt sorry for him, it wasn't even his fault for this delay, but he was the one getting blamed for it because he was the only one in contact with the outside world.
 
Warren broke out from the players he was talking to and spoke in a loud voice. "Okay everyone, we just got an update from the administrators, they say that they will be able to solve the glitch in the system, but they will have to install a new update into the game first."
 
I didn't know about this new update, but Casey seemed afraid.
 
"Does it mean that this world is going to change?" she said. Elsie comforted her by rubbing her hair. 
 
"Don't worry, this game is well managed by the administrators, they know what is going on and they will solve it." She checked the game time, "It has only been about thirty minutes since the glitch happened and they're already dealing with it"
 
I was curious though, why were they installing an update for a game that was supposedly complete? What problems would the update solve?
 
Warren continued speaking over the noisy crowd, "When the update kicks in, you will experience the original environment of the game until it finishes loading, it will last about five minutes so don't worry"
 
 Soon after he said it, Warren nodded to the chat he was having with the administrators and then closed the window. He then looked to us, "Okay everyone, the update is going to kick in now" 
 
We all made a circle, I held on to Casey and Richard, and they held on to Elsie. But the feeling in my hands disappeared after a few seconds, and before I noticed it there was no one around me. The world looked exactly the same, and the sun was shining above us with clouds circulating, but there were no other players. Richard, Elsie and Casey were gone.
 
I knew it was just the update, they isolated each player to be able to update the system properly, but still, it felt a bit lonely. I didn't want to stay here like this.
 
I remembered Warren saying it would last five minutes, but it seemed to last a lot longer, there was no sense of time, the clouds were moving, and wind blew through the grass, but there was nothing happening. I was all by myself here in this world.
 
I closed my eyes and tried to relax. I hoped that when I opened them I would be back at home at the dinner table and this was all a long dream. But when I opened my eyes, it was still the same, the world around me stretched on for miles and miles and there was no one else.
 
Finally, before I knew it I felt sensation in my hands, and then I was holding hands, I looked around and saw other players, and Richard and Casey looking around.
 
Casey burst into tears. "I was so scared" she said, "There was no one else around me, I tried running but it didn't go anywhere" Elsie held her and tried whispering something.
 
But I was fixated on something else. I had played this game before, but I had never noticed these new stats in my window.
 
"Diamonds held - 4, Players conquered - 0"
 
Richard had noticed it before I did. "The game had completely changed" he said, "What is all of this?"
 
Other players around us were also mesmerised, they opened and closed their stat windows to try and figure  it out.
 
Then Warren stood up to talk, he still had contact with the administrators so he knew all of the details, "The game has changed" he said
 
Yes it had, just a bit...
 
---

### Chapter Four
 
The addition of diamonds that came with the update was something I had read in the news about the game, the programmers wanted to add more dimensions to the game and one feature they considered was a more PK based game where players could attack each other. In this mode the currency of the game was diamonds, strong substances used to upgrade levels. Every player had them in their inventory.
 
"What does this mean?" Casey was pointing to her face, but actually she was pointing at something she saw in her screen, she just wasn't very good at it.
 
"That's the 'players conquered' " I said, "It means that now we are able to attack other players and get experience points from their death"
 
"We are attacking other players?" Elsie said, "That's how we have to win?"
 
"Yeah" I said, "But don't worry, because there's no harm in it, even if you are killed you revive immediately over here anyway, your level will be reset to 1 and nothing else will change" 
 
Casey shivered, "I don't like this, why did they have to change it?" She looked around, I knew what she meant, suddenly everyone around us felt like an enemy. They could potentially attack us, even if nothing happened it felt bad.
 
"How about this one?" Casey pointed to her cheek, I knew that she was trying to point to the other stat, about the diamonds, but it was too funny to see her pointing like that.
 
"What?" I pretended not to know.
 
"This thing, here" she pointed strongly
 
I shrugged and tried to hold back my laughter.
 
"The diamonds..."
 
"The diamonds are what you get when you level up, you use them to level up, or else you have the option of giving them to someone else, or destroying them."
 
"They are the levels in a physical form" Richard said. For some reason he also knew about this obscure game mode that the company had only ben experimenting with.
 
"Oh Okay" Casey nodded, she probably didn't understand, but she nodded like she did. "So we can leave this world if we just reach level 10, so if we get 10 of these diamonds and use them?"
 
Richard nodded, "You're right, you're very smart Casey"
 
"Yes I am" she said.
 
With the new update essentially nothing had changed, only that now there were diamonds to replace the levels, and players were able to attack each other.
 
"Why did they include this update?' Elsie said, "Does it mean that the player who cheated has used something that this update reverts to normal?"
 
I hadn't thought about it like that, but Elsie was probably right, that's why the administrators had decided to reinstate this strange update. By updating the game the cheat just became a normal part of it, so it was possible to continue normally.
 
"So why is there no log out button?" Elsie said. "If this was updated to solve the game, then we should be able to log out after the game was updated, since the system is normal"
 
I was amazed, Elsie was really ahead with her thinking. It was true, the log out button should have been there, but since it wasn't, there was only one explanation.
 
"This update doesn't have an easy log out option" Richard said, stealing the words out of my mouth. Unfortunately there was no log out in this update, so we are forced to play the game.
 
Elsie brushed her hair, then tied it behind her in a ponytail. "Let's play shall we?" She looked at all of us. "I'm ready to go home"
 
But as soon as she said it a bright light shot forward from just outside the spawning area.
 
Everyone ran forward and gathered around where it emanated. There was a small diamond that was left behind. One player stood in the middle with a large sword resting on the ground. He slowly picked up the diamond and placed it in his inventory. Then without looking around he walked past us and away.
 
There was no doubt about it, he had just attacked another player and stolen a diamond. It was much easier to do so than attacking creatures for hours. One player could give you one diamond, and you could choose to give another player as many diamonds as you had.
 
Elsie and I looked at each other, this was bad news, everyone might start attacking each other. I caught the glances of other players, everyone had the same thoughts, they wanted 10 diamonds so they could go home, now there was an easy way to do so. 
 
It was only a game, and death didn't mean much, you instantly re-spawned at the main area. But I still couldn't do it, this world was far too realistic for a players' death to be discounted as meaningless.
 
I grabbed the others and tried to push my way out of the group as soon as I could. But before I could, a familiar voice spoke up.
 
It was Warren, he was standing in the middle of the crowd and announcing, "Everyone, a player was just defeated here, but they will re-spawn in the center shortly. We can all work together and make sure that everyone logs out safely, you have my word on that, there is no need to attack other players and steal their diamonds"
 
The players nodded, none of them wanted to be attacked, everyone wanted to be peaceful. Warren organized the players into small groups like the one we had made and tried to make them communicate with other groups, in this way if each group defeated monsters, they would level up easily. 
 
But halfway through, the message appeared.
 
People talked about the sword from when it was first made in the game. 
 
It had the power of a thousand birds, the ferocity of ten thousand screaming warriors, and a sharpness to slice the world in half.
 
But no one had seen the sword for the last two million years.
 
And it had been reduced to something of the legends.
 
The first player to reach level 10 becomes the owner of the sword until his death.
 
The message appeared from one of the players, he was flashing out text that he found in the rulebook.
 
I quickly checked my rulebook, I had read it from front to back but never found anything about a sword. I typed in to directly find the word. Then I froze,
 
It was there, the passage that the player was quoting was written clearly. I swear it hadn't been there earlier.
 
There was only one explanation,
 
It had appeared with the new update...
 
---

### Chapter Five - One is just a number
 
After the first player flashed the quote from the rulebook others started to follow, they found other passages of interest and flashed them so everyone could see. There were new rules about all sorts of things, buying items, selling items, and how to win the game.
 
But the one of most interest was the rule about the sword. Somewhere in the game the rules had changed and a powerful sword would be presented to the player who got to level 10 first. I don't know why this rule was implemented, or why it had been designed. 
Elsie turned to us with a worried look in her eyes, "This game was a solo game, we all leveled up by ourselves" she said, "But after this update it's become more competitive" 
 
She was right, the design of the game was leaning towards competition among ourselves, with the new update it was possible to attack each other. And when you reached the highest level first, you had a huge advantage with the new item that was installed.
 
Elsie went on, "We don't know anything about the people designing these games, but this is a strange update to have implemented, they could have had a glitch anywhere."
 
Richard sat down on one of the rocks, it had red algae growing on it that stuck still for what looked like a million years. "I think we need to make a plan" he said, "If we just sit still it won't solve anything, I just have that feeling" 
 
Casey nodded, "I want to stay with you guys" she said, "Do you think that's okay?" She glanced around and we all nodded in response, I think we all felt the same way. In this strange environment it was important to have this at least, if nothing else.
 
We decided to set off with only the four of us, there were players everywhere who had already joined groups of their own and had already head off. Elsie put it well, "At least we know everyone's playing."
 
Everyone had no choice but to play now, disconnecting was no longer viable.
 
When we decided on a direction to take I noticed that there were mountains all around us, some of them were enwrapped in giant clouds that danced around these mountains elegantly. Then I couldn't help but wonder whether we could go there. Were those mountains also a part of this map, or were they digitally inaccessible. If they were, then what would we see over those peaks, what would the view be on the other side?
 
"We're going that way" Casey pointed towards one direction.
 
"Why that way?" Richard said.
 
Casey laughed, "I like that mountain with the pointy head"
 
I don't know whether it was a good idea to be following Casey's judgment, but we started walking in that direction anyway. Richard just shrugged and moved on. There was nowhere else that we knew was better.
 
Elsie caught up to us before we went very far. "Guys, there's a 'team' icon. Let's make a group" She opened up a screen on her menu which showed her inviting us to a team.
 
An invitation popped up in my menu screen, I accepted it and was in the team, Richard and Casey quickly joined as well. Then Elsie asked us what our team name should be.
 
"Fire dragons" Richard said.
 
"Sparkling Fairies" Casey said.
 
I shrugged, I couldn't decide on anything. "How about Team A?"
 
Elsie ignored me, "How about Sparkling Dragons? To put the two of yours together" Casey nodded up and down in excitement. Richard agreed.
 
And that's how we became the "Sparkling Dragons", "I love the name!" Casey said, "We are going to defeat everyone" 
 
I had to smile as well, it felt good to be in a team after so long by myself.
 
We found monsters and defeated them easily. The plan was a simple one, to reach level 10 and log out.
 
A small monster appeared, it had fluffy ears and giant white feet. It was named a "Greevil Giant" Elsie defeated it easily, then her experience bar went up to halfway. Richard saw this and copied as well, soon he was also increasing in experience. Before we knew it all of us were hitting level 2 and almost on level 3.  Even Casey was following along with no trouble. With each level we got more combat stats, the other stats remained untouched but it didn't matter since only combat stats contributed to leveling. 
 
Elsie was the first to reach level 3. She was really talented at this game and was teaching us all how to play. "You just need to be able to read where the monsters will attack, and then counter it before it realizes it"
 
"Yeah, I understand" I said, but everything she was saying was just going over my head. The fact was that I wasn't very good at fighting, I barely made it to level 2, Elsie made it look easy. I swung my sword back and forth before finally defeating the monster in front of me, a level 1 baby dragon. To be honest I had no idea what I was doing, not after I saw Elsie commanding her sword.
 
Then Elsie stopped and grinned. "Look guys, I found a new tab in the menu screen"
 
She called us over to show us what she had found, Casey stopped attacking the small bat she almost defeated, and Richard finished off a large pig.
 
What Elsie showed us was a 'Highscores' tab. It was right in the main menu screen, we could only guess what was beyond it.
 
Elsie opened the tab and a row of numbers appeared. She scrolled down all the way until the page stopped at fifty. Names slowly started appearing on the right side.
 
Casey pushed in front of me, I tried to move her head away. "I want to see, what is it?" she said.
 
"It's the High Scores" I said, "Of the top players in the game"
 
The names appearing next to the numbers were changing every few seconds, like they were being constantly refreshed. The name at the number fifty changed from "Ziggasaurus" to "Angel Beat67" to something else again, it was too fast to keep track. Some names moved up the ranks while others fell down and disappeared. The score was based purely on the level attained, and how close they were to the next one.
 
Because there were so many players and each one was leveling, it was hard to keep track. These names were level 4 or 5. I didn't know how they got to level up so fast, I was trying my best, so was Elsie, and she was level 3, I was 2. 
 
But it didn't matter, Elsie swiped and scrolled up the screen to the lower digits, here number 25 was
"Dragonfiremaster453" with a level of 6, this area was similar. How did they level up so fast? Did they find a special place to train with special creatures to defeat and some kind of bonus experience? It was beyond comprehension, everyone here was new to this game, but it seemed like the players on these scoreboards were organized and knew what they were doing.
 
Elsie kept scrolling up, the levels capped at about 6 all the way to the top ten players. But we were all thinking the same thing. Who is Number One?
 
Then Elsie scrolled to the top. I couldn't believe it, the top ten players were all above level 7.
Number three was level 8
Number two was level 8
And Number one was level 9.
 
As we were watching, a few places shifted in the lower numbers but the top three remained unchanged. Then something incredible happened, right before our eyes the highest ranked player's number changed from nine to ten.
 
The highest level had been reached.

---

### Chapter Six - Race
 
The top ranked player in the game reached max level. Casey, Richard, Elsie and me looked at each other, we were all thinking the same thing. What next?
 
The ground started shaking, the sky darkened and thunderclouds appeared. Then all around us lightning started to strike. This transformation happened over the course of a few seconds, suddenly there were lightning bolts all around us, but not normal bolts, these were pure green.
 
Then as soon as the clouds appeared, they were gone. The sky was back to the bright blue that it had been. It must have been an event triggered by a player reaching level 10. 
 
"Look" Elsie pointed to the Highscore rankings she still had open, next to the name of the player ranked number one there was a green sword sparkling.
 
There was no need to ask, it was the legendary sword. It was already in play. But how did they train so fast.
 
Instinctively, I glanced at the name of the player with the sword, world ranking number one.
 
"Ladoe" - Level 10 - In possession of legendary sword
 
Richard spoke up, "I understand, now is an important time in the game, it's when the players separate themselves from each other, some players will come out with high levels, and others with low levels, it's all just how you decide to play."
 
"And some players have already gotten to level 10?" Elsie said, she looked at her own level in disbelief, "I'm only level 3" She sat down on the ground in dejection, she probably thought she could go much further. 
 
"It's weird" Casey said, "How come you get a legendary item if you get to level 10?"
 
"Because the game wants you to compete" Richard said, he crossed his arms and unwielded his weapons. "If we want to go home, we need to get to level 10, so it doesn't matter, don't fall into what the game wants you to do."
 
"It's not that" Casey said, also storing away her sword. "What use is a legendary item if you are going to leave the game anyway?"
 
Suddenly it struck me what she was trying to say, we were trying to disconnect from the game by completing it so what use was a sword after completing the game?
 
"It's just an incentive to keep you playing" Richard said, "You don't have to log out when you reach level 10, this game is desperate to get players."
 
Elsie raised her hand to silence Richard. "Wait" she said, "Look what I found" She showed us the team screen for Sparkling Dragons, there were a few other players who had requested to join.
 
I didn't know any of the names but Richard's eyes widened. "Grace, Lennie, Balza, Guys I know these players, they're my friends from the real world." 
 
"Really?" Elsie grabbed Richard, like it was the biggest news she had heard. "Is this true?"
 
"They're good guys" Richard said, "I swear you'll like them" Elsie accepted the request and invited the guys over. Since the game had progressed so fast we decided to go back to the spawning area and buy some items with the gold we attained.
 
The trip back to the spawning area took about an hour, we had ventured further out than we expected. As we neared the gates, we saw that there were groups of people standing outside. Some of them gave us strange glances as we passed but Richard told us to keep our head down and keep going to the spawning area which was in the center.
 
I immediately noticed that the spawning area had changed a lot. There were a lot of players sitting around doing nothing, most of them were level 1 players.
 
It made me frustrated to see them, they just chatted to each other quietly without any intention of getting themselves out of the game. I called out to one of the groups nearby "You guys are still level 1?"
 
They stopped talking and looked at me, then finally one of them spoke, "You're some arrogant player coming to talk us down, we've already heard enough of that so get lost"
 
Casey jumped in, "We're just trying to reach level 10 so we can leave" she said, "He's just concerned about you"
 
They looked at each other and burst out laughing. "She says level 10"
 
We all looked at each other, what happened after we left? Why were these players so dejected? We stood staring at them, at the changes that had taken place. 
 
"You think we haven't tried?" One of them explained. "We were level 2 earlier"
 
"Then how come..." I bit my words back, I knew why they were level 1 now, but I couldn't believe it. 
 
"You guys were killed?" Elsie said, she stepped forward and frowned, as if to console them. "How come?"
 
They all laughed again, "You guys are clueless, how did you survive this long? This place here, this spawning area is the same as a graveyard, why did you come wandering back. We were attacked by other players on our way back here to buy better weapons, they stole our diamonds and used them to level themselves up. "
 
Why were players attacking each other? Even if it was to win the game, stealing other player's diamonds meant that other players wouldn't be able to level up for themselves. How could they steal other player's diamonds and stop others from leveling? That was too selfish.
 
"Hey you guys" One of the sitters called out, "I'll deliver a message for you, I'm going to beat this game, so just tell me something you want me to say" 
 
"I'm going to get out of here as well" Casey said, "So I don't need you to tell her, I"ll tell her myself" 
 
The group of guys burst out laughing, Casey looked confused. "They were just winding you up" I said, "They never meant it" She was still shrugging so I also shrugged. "Never mind, it's not important anyway."
 
Casey looked bewildered, but I was impressed by her, she really was trying to get out, her resolve gave me confidence that we would really do it.
 
Elsie was busy looking at her stats, Richard was doing the same, and I felt like maybe I should as well.
 
"Just wait until you guys get defeated by some punk who's trying to reach a higher level a couple of times" A girl sitting down said, "Then you'll just sit here like us and wait"
 
There was a sudden sound of 'oink oink', like a pig. My guard jumped up, the others did as well.
 
"What is it?" Elsie said. 
 
"It's the animated sound of a player who was defeated respawning, you can record the sound yourself"
 
"It's John Carley on his talk show imitating a pig" One of the guys said.
 
We burst out laughing, even Elsie and Richard were smiling. We had all seen the clip on the TV and laughed. This player had recorded a pig sound and forgot to change it to something serious. It was a sound that he didn't hear, but everyone else did.
The player emerged, he was also level 1 now, and grinning. "Another bastard stole my diamond"
 
"You're back already Damien, you hardly left the gates"
 
"They're swarming out there, won't even let me get to the first creatures" he sat down and crossed his legs, joining the chit chat. It seemed like he knew the others well already.
 
I was thinking about them and what it would be like to respawn with a cool sound when Elsie waved me to her. She showed me the same screen as earlier of the High Scores. 
 
The same name, "Lahoe" was flashing, but beside his name was "level - 15"
 
He had leveled 5 times in the short time that we walked here.
 
"He went past level 10?" Richard said, "I thought 10 was the finish?"
 
"No" Elsie shook her head, "He must be playing optional extra levels"
 
One of the sitters stood up and came towards us. He took slow steps in no hurry, he had an orange beard and tired eyes. "They knew before playing the game, so the first thing they did, as soon as they were able to, was attack another player."
 
Now I was starting to understand
 
The game was over before we even started playing.

### Chapter Seven - Winners and Losers
 
"In every game there are players who leech off everyone else, this isn't a graveyard, it's a farmyard." One of the sitters was shouting out.
 
He was repeating out loud what was recently circulating around here, that this spawning area was a farm ground for the high level players who were just using low level players to gain easy diamonds and levels. 
 
Richard was still surprised to see such a discrepancy. "We're being left behind" he said, "You look at the stats of some of these players, players conquered - 3, that means that they've been defeated 3 times, so the top players keep increasing in level while the bottom players stay at the bottom. The top players are choosing to play on and not leave the game."
 
"And that they gave three diamonds away" Casey said. It was sad to see these players sitting here and doing nothing about it. I had a strong feeling of needing to do something to help them, they were players like us, but were different. We had something they had lost...
 
Hope.
 
In the short time we had gone, the world had changed immensely, but our reason for playing hadn't. I wasn't sure if we were able to disconnect from the game at level 10, the top players were all above level 15, it wasn't just the number one player now, even the lower ranked ones were past level 10.
 
Maybe they were also choosing to stay in the game...
 
"There's only one way to know" Elsie said, "We have to meet one of these top players and ask them"
 
"Like that's going to happen" Casey said, "They're famous now, everyone's talking about them"
 
She was right, the top ranked players were everywhere, what they looked like, even their training methods were being discussed. It was hard to accept it, but...
 
"It's becoming normal" Elsie looked at me, "That's what you're thinking right? That all of this game and its lifestyle is becoming like normal life."
 
I blushed, how did she know what I was thinking.
 
As if answering me she continued, "I know because you looked so sad just now. I felt the same way earlier when everyone was focusing on leveling and forgetting about the real world, but actually, now I see that they're trying to be responsible and accept the world in front of them. Even though they look like they've forgotten the real world, most of them are still longing to go back, it's just that they don't show it so clearly"
 
I was surprised, even though it didn't seem like it, Elsie was thinking quite deeply about things. I felt proud to be on the same team as her.
 
"That's why I'm trying to level up" she said to me, "I want to do something to help this game, so I joined this team, you seem like an honest person. So I trusted you" She looked at me directly, without a trace of shyness. 
 
"I know you're still working" she said, "In this world it's our responsibility to level ourselves up so that we can do something useful for everyone, help them leave this world"
 
I nodded, I understood what she meant.
 
We decided to go to the store to stock up on items, Casey led the way, she had already bought some new shoes and was looking at buying some clothes and make-up. Then finally, a weapon. Richard was trying to talk her out of spending her precious savings on worthless items, but Casey was unswayed.
 
"I'll show you guys all the places we can go to buy things" she waved her hand, "Follow me"
 
In this game, there was only one currency, and this was the currency for every part of the game.
 
Diamonds.
 
Diamonds were used for leveling up, when you leveled up, you had more stats in the skill that you leveled. There were countless skills that helped with all sorts of things but only combat skill made you stronger. For each level, you had to open a diamond and use it. 
 
Apart from this, all the items in the stores were also bought using diamonds. Diamonds could be broken into tiny shards which were then used to buy different items. Players saved up diamonds and then took them to the store to buy expensive items. But there was a risk to this, the more diamonds I saved up the more likely I was to be attacked by other players who were wanting to steal my diamonds.
 
I had one diamond on me and had broken it into shards to use in the stores. Casey was using all of her shards on high heels and short skirts, Elsie was buying stainless weapons. Richard was brewing up some potions that he said would help in combat. 
 
And I, I didn't know what to buy so I was just looking. We decided to meet up again in an hour and leave the area together. I walked around and saw all sorts of things being sold, items that looked like strange pipes, guitars, and even deer horns. There was an option next to the name of the item that would tell how the item could be used but it was a long box of text and I couldn't bother reading it. In the end I didn't buy anything and wandered out to where we were supposed to meet.
 
I saw a whole new amount of level 1 players sitting in the middle. They were all players who had been recently defeated. On one of the benches I found Richard and Elsie sitting together, they saw me and waved me over.
 
"Where's Casey?" I said>
 
"She's always late" Elsie said, "We need to tell her to be on time"
 
Just then, Casey walked over to us. She wasn't smiling, and her clothes were the same ones that I first saw her in.
 
"Didn't you buy anything?" Elsie said. Casey was showing off her high heels and jeans jacket earlier, now she didn't have any of it on. 
 
"Wait" Richard held out his hand, "Casey, how come you're level 1? Weren't you leveling together with us?" Last time I saw her Casey had been level 2.
 
Unless...
 
Casey shrugged, "I'm sorry" she said, "I was attacked, I'm sorry to let you down"
 
"What happened?" Richard grabbed her by the shoulders and held her still. "Exactly what happened Casey?"
 
Casey looked up at us, "I left the area to go and find another store I heard about, and then another player attacked me, he stole all of my diamonds and shards"
 
I sank down and held my head, I couldn't believe that Casey would be attacked. Richard also looked at me with disappointment on his face. "Who was it?" he said. "I'll fight them for you"
 
"You can't" Casey said, "He was a level 18 player" She frowned, "I didn't even see his attack, it was too fast for me to even react to it." She looked at her palms, "Before I knew it, I was right back here"
 
"Level 18?" Richard said, he looked to me as if doubting it, "Are you sure Casey?"
 
"I'm sure" she said, "He was near the clothes store just now, I think his name was Guizan"
 
As soon as Richard heard the name he fell silent. He let go of Casey and sat down with his hands on his knees.
 
"What's wrong?" Elsie said.
 
"Guizan?" Richard said, "Are you sure his name was Guizan?"
 
Casey nodded, "I'm sure, I wouldn't forget the name of a player who attacked me"
 
"If that's true, then this player was one of the strongest players in the game, we don't have a chance against him." Richard looked up at us, "I know him"
 
"Who is he?" I said.
 
"I really needed to meet him." Richard said, "There was something important that I needed to ask him."
 
Then he looked at us, 
 
"It's why I came to this game"
 
---

### Chapter Eight - Guizan
 
Elsie opened the High Score menu again, she scrolled down, I noticed that the top player was at level 35 now. But Elsie kept scrolling and stopped at number 9. She read out loud,
 
"Ranked number 9 : "Guizan" Level 19 "
 
He was one of the strongest players, so how did Richard know him?
 
We were walking towards the area where Casey had been attacked, we had to be very careful because of the number of players willing to attack us when we left town. We stuck together as a group.
 
"Guizan's real name is something else" Richard said, "He's a fanatical gamer, and has tried many games. I've also played many games before, and I've seen him all over the place. He's always one of the top players, he's incredibly talented. He finds new ways of combining items and spells to win a battle."
 
"And does he know you?" Elsie said, "Or is he just famous"
 
"I'm not very good at games" Richard said, "But one time, I forget where and in what game, but Guizan helped me when I was facing losses, he saved me. I came to this game because I wanted to meet him and say thank you."
 
Richard held us back, there were five players in front of us, all of them were level 4. They were grinning as they encircled us like caged animals. Like they had their eyes on some weak prey.
 
"You guys look like you have a lot of diamonds" the one in the middle said, he drew out a longbow and some huge arrows. The ones we couldn't afford in the store. "It's going to be fast and painless" he said, "I'll show you"
 
The other guys also drew out their weapons, there were all sorts of things, but I had seen most of them in the store. We had no choice here but to fight, we were too far away from a safety area.
 
I had just thought that we would be able to walk this far without being attacked.
 
Elsie wordlessly drew out her sword and stood in position. I also took out my sword and clenched it, I had no idea what I was doing with it, but hopefully they wouldn't know. 
 
"That guy there" one of the guys pointed at me, "He has no idea what he's doing with that sword" The others sniggered, "You're right, his knees are shaking"
 
"Go back to level one" The guy in the middle said, his name was Meteor "Don't worry about your diamonds" He ran at me with a grin and swung his sword with his right hand. I managed to block it but the side of his blade cut my chest. I saw Elsie jump in beside me, she screamed and charged at one of their players. Casey and Richard did the same. Swords were clanking all around me but I focused on my own, if I lost here I wouldn't be going anywhere.
 
But it wasn't a fair fight, and these guys knew it, they were two levels higher than Elsie and four levels higher than me and Richard. We would have to pull a miracle.
 
I swung my sword to the right, but Meteor blocked it. He grinned and shot an arrow straight at me. I saw it in the air making its way towards me but I couldn't dodge it in time. It lodged itself in my chest. 
 
"You're a coward, just give up" Meteor said.
 
"No, I'm going to defeat you" I yelled out and swung to the left this time. I saw my blade sparkling in the light and then blocked by his longbow. Then he kicked me with speed I couldn't match. 
 
I was almost out of health, Richard was also losing, and Elsie was taking on two opponents.
 
Casey was gone.
 
Those players sitting at the spawning area would laugh at me when they saw that I had tried to leave and just ended up back with them.
 
"I know you're not much of a gamer" Meteor's tone changed when he was near the last blow. "Sorry, but I need to do this to get out as well" He raised his sword to attack, the last final hit and I would be reverted back to level 1.
 
But it never landed, his sword clanked against something solid. I looked up and saw a shield in front of me. It was blocking the attacks. 
 
Next moment, a player jumped in front of me and slashed Meteor. Meteor's eyes barely reacted and his hp bar decreased, it kept running down.
 
Then I couldn't believe it, his hp vanished. 
 
He fell to the ground and disappeared, his mouth was moving but I couldn't hear it, his eyes were watching me intently and then they swivelled to the figure above me.
 
His eyes were the last to disappear, but they had a fear painted in them, and I think a strange type of respect.
 
The figure in front of me ran to attack the others and with one hit finished them all off. He finished all of the five off and saved Richard and Elsie. 
 
Then he turned to face me. 
 
His name had "Guizan" written above it.
 
He ignored the others and walked up to me, grinning with his fangs showing like a dog.
 
"Are you Guizan?" Richard said. "Do you remember me?"
 
Guizan looked at Richard briefly, "No" he turned back to me.
 
"Kei, I've been waiting for you for a long time"
 
 Richard ran in front of him, "Guizan, remember me? We met in that game and you saved me."
 
Guizan tried to peer over Richard at me but Richard was waving his hands. "I can't believe you're here, I've  wanted to thank you for so long"
 
Guizan finally turned to look at Richard. "Who are you?"
 
"Don't you remember? you saved me that one time when I was collapsed"
 
Guizan shrugged, "I don't...wait, were you that kid who had an overdose?"  
 
"Yeah" Richard smiled, "That was me, and in that game you were a policeman. Thank you for helping me that time, I tried to contact you but I couldn't find your address." He fell to the ground and bowed.
 
Guizan was expressionless, he looked down at Richard quietly. "That time I saw someone collapsed in the store, after buying too many chemicals"
 
"Thank you, I'm really grateful for it, a high level player like yourself helping a lowly peon like me."
 
"You know," Guizan said, "I'm a policeman in real life, that wasn't a game, that was real life"
 
Richard looked up, "What?"
 
"You overdosed in real life" he said, "Get a grip on yourself"
 
Guizan turned his gaze back to me. 
 
What was happening here?

---

### Chapter Nine - The Most Important Thing
 
Richard was shocked, "But I was buying the items with the game money. But I couldn't level up much"
 
"Do you need help?" Guizan said, "You need to get back to the real world, this is just a game Richard, I'm just a player."
 
"But we were attacking and leveling skills"
 
"It wasn't a game" Guizan said, "It was the real world, with our real lives on the line, you shouldn't confuse that, you definitely cannot."
 
Richard stared at Guizan with his eyes wide open, after a long pause he suddenly burst out with emotion. "It was, and my name was Richard as well. I almost died, and you saved me." He grabbed onto Guizan's leg. "You saved me"
 
Guizan grimaced in disgust, he shook his leg, "Get off me, I was just doing my job."
 
Richard looked up with tears in his eyes. "I want to thank you"
 
"You need to get your life straight" Guizan said, "I can't do that for you, you're the only one that can do that"
 
Elsie and I stood by as this was happening. I couldn't believe it, Richard was a completely different person to how he usually showed himself, now he was weak and feeble. There was none of the dignity we usually saw in him.
 
"I hated myself" Richard said, "Because I was trying so hard but everyone around me was progressing faster than I was. Before I knew it, I just swallowed all those pills." He started weeping, first with a tiny lip shrivel, then he started to cry out loud like a baby who was crying for the first time.
 
Guizan sighed and sat on a big rock nearby. Elsie went over to Richard and wrapped her arms around him. "It's okay, shhh" she said.
 
It took a while for Richard to calm down, when he did, he just silently stared at Guizan. Guizan was picking up grass and playing with it.
 
"What I think..." Richard said, "I look up to you" Guizan looked back at him with no emotion. "I look up to you Guizan, you're a high level player in every game I see you, so I want to be like you and become really good at something."
 
Guizan scratched his hair, it was grey like dust. "If you want to become good at something, you should try something in the real world."
 
"The real world" Richard repeated, 
 
"This world is just a game" Guizan opened his inventory and changed his items, his armor, his clothes, even his hairstyle. Then he leaned in and stood right in front of Richard. "That's all it is, a game, don't get that wrong."
 
Richard nodded, "I won't" he said, "I will get out of here and show you what I can do"
 
Guizan finally smiled, "Good, when you've done something, come and talk to me in the real world" He turned around and added, "I hope you'll be able to defeat me at it"
 
Richard smiled and wiped away the snot with the back of his hand "Of course, I'm going to try my best."
 
Guizan now turned to me, "The reason I'm here is because I came here to talk to you Kei"
 
"Me?" I didn't know what was happening, "How come you want to talk to me?"
 
"Is that why you saved us?" Casey said "Because of Kei?"
 
He nodded, "I'm a high level player, I know this game well." He sat down on another rock and indicated for me to come and sit next to him.
 
"Just me?" he nodded. I looked at Elsie Richard and Casey, they understood and turned away to give us space. 
 
"We'll just go to train some levels on some monsters" Elsie said, she grabbed Casey and dragged her off.
 
"Don't worry, they'll be fine, I'm here if anything happens" Guizan said. The others walked off and we were silent for a while. The atmosphere changed to something much more serious as soon as they left, I felt like Guizan had something that had bene on his mind for a long time.
 
"What is the most important thing in this game?" he said.
 
I pondered on it, "Diamonds" I said, "Collecting diamonds lets you level, and when you don't collect them you are defeated by other higher level players"
 
He nodded, then raised a hand to his beard and touched it, it was also gray like his hair. "I'm sure you've heard of the item that can only be bought with ten thousand diamonds?"
 
"No" I said
 
"You haven't? Well I guess it hasn't spread down to these levels yet."
 
"What is it?" One diamond was already a lot, I couldn't even imagine ten thousand of them. That player would be targeted by everyone.
 
"That's ten thousand levels, isn't it?" Guizan said, he shook his head and sighed. "I can't believe what I've gotten myself into this time. This game is worse than anything I've ever played." He moved over even closer to me. "I came here because I wanted to tell you something"
 
"Never mind the high scores" Guizan said, "In this game there are 5 top players who cannot be defeated and will sway the direction of the game with their every decision. " Then he looked at me "You are one of those five Kei" He clenched his fists, "And the fact of the matter is that I'm not"
 
I felt like it was very strange for him to be saying so. I was just another ridiculous player caught in the game.
 
"I'm sure you don't realize it" he said, "But I do, and my judgment is usually right, that's why I'm a high level player. And I'm saying that you have something special in this game."
 
Now I was confused, "What do you mean?"
 
"You will find out in time" he stared at me and opened his mouth as if to say something, but stopped.
 
"We're just trying to level up to level 10 and then leave this game and go back to the real world"
 
Guizan nodded "You'll find out in time" he repeated. 

---

### Chapter Ten - I just want to go home
 
After Guizan left, the others asked me about what he said.
 
"I dont know" I said, and I really didn't, it seemed like he came all this way without anything much to say.
 
Elsie stared at me quietly, then she waved "Come on, let's go"
 
"Go where?" Richard said, he was still looking in the direction where Guizan left.
 
"We're going to leave this game, remember?" Casey said.
"Yup we are" I smiled, it was ironic that we weren't concerned about it as much as we were, but we were heading out on a mission to leave this game.
 
"Casey, which way are we going?" Elsie said.
 
Casey closed her eyes and began spinning around. She finally stopped and had her hands pointing in a direction. "That way" She pointed to some mountains far away.
 
"Okay let's go" Elsie said, "Our navigator has decided the way"
 
"Just like that?" Richard said, "Are you serious? That's going to decide the direction of everything that's going to happen."
 
"Well how about you?" Both girls stared at him, "Where do you want to go?"
 
Richard felt the pressure and shrugged, "I guess that way's as good as any other one, but Kei, what do you think?"
 
"I think it's a great idea" I said.
 
"Oh not you too" Richard shrugged, "Fine let's go"
 
The girls began joking that Richard always disagreed with what they said, and he began arguing back.
 
"Let's do this, we're the Sparkling Dragons" I shouted out loud into the sky, "We're going to get to level 10 and leave this game!"
 
Casey also joined in, "I'm Casey Thomas from Reading, I'm going to go back home so don't change my room around Mum and dad."
 
Soon we were all shouting at the sky, the distance to home seemed to shrink for a while.
 
A wild Graygon appeared, we defeated it in five minutes
A wild Resnuma appeared, we defeated it in three minutes
A wild Yorii appeared, we defeated it in eight minutes
A wild Hannah appeared, we defeated it in two minutes
 
Before we knew it we were far from the spawning area and all of us were level 9. We had defeated so many monsters already and gotten a lot of levels, we shared the experience around so that we could all level up together and not leave anyone behind.
 
There was one more creature to get us all to level 10. Then we would have the option of leaving the game. I saw the real world flash before me, I could almost taste the excitement, it was so close.
 
I thought that once we reached level 10 we would complete the game.
 
A wild Fire East Dragon appeared, we defeated it in two minutes
 
Then we all got the last diamond to get to level 10.
 
I went first, I used it and watched as my level increased to 10. Richard followed, and then Casey and finally Elsie. We were doing really well to not be attacked by other players as we did so, probably because we had travelled far enough from the town.
 
"Kei" Richard said, "Is it me or is there nothing here?"
 
"Where do you go to complete the game?" Casey said.
 
Elsie frowned, "There is nowhere to go is there? Does the game not end at level 10? That's what Warren and Israel said, they said we had to complete the game at level 10."
It was true, there was nothing that appeared when we reached level 10, no sign of us completing anything, the game just went on as if it was another level. I thought back to the highest player going to level 11. He had probably also realized it, the horrible truth that there was no end at level 10.
 
"Do we have to go higher?" Casey said. "What if we go to level 15, or level 20?"
 
I didn't want to answer her, none of us did, we just fell silent. All of our hopes had been directed to this moment, and it was painful to see that there was nothing there, it was as empty as the other levels. 
 
Casey's tone had completely changed "I don't care about the levels, or the fighting, or the spawning, I don't care about any of it all. I hate this game"
 
Then she said what was on all of our minds, "I just want to go home"
 
"Come on Casey" Elsie said, "We'll find a way to end it. We just need to ask someone."
 
Just then a scary thought dawned on me, the game had started with a lot of players, what if none of them had left.
 
Was that why the top player kept leveling up higher and higher? If he didn't level up we wouldn't know if it was possible to even do so.
 
I couldn't see a way out.
 
"What did Guizan tell you?" Richard said, "Did he tell you how to leave?"
 
"No" I said, finally understanding why Guizan had come to talk to me, "I don't think he knew either, so I think he had come to ask me, to find out whether I knew"
 
"And you don't?" Elsie said
 
"No"
 
Elsie made a strange face, as if to say, 'why did Guizan come and talk to you then?'
 
If a deep sigh could be heard, then we would have all made the same sound, a loud sigh that shook the very core of the world.
 
"We need to ask someone about it" I said, "Someone who will know"
 
We decided to head back to the spawning area and see whether anyone knew or not. Warren and Israel would probably know, at least they would be able to tell us why we couldn't leave even after reaching level 10.
 
"Which way is it?" Elsie said,
 
"That way" Richard pointed in a direction in the land, "It's about three hours that way, then we'll see it"
 
He could have pointed anywhere, we were three hours from somewhere.
 
"Okay let's go" this time it was Casey leading the way. "We're going to find out how to get back to the real world"

---

### Chapter Eleven
 
No one attacked us as we entered the town, most players who were attacking each other were still around level 5, they knew they would only lose if they tried to come against us.
 
The players sitting in the spawning area had increased to a larger number than earlier, more players were losing and had given up hope.
We found Israel near the center of the area. She had not changed at all, a few guys were standing around and making her laugh. Elsie snorted, "Guys are the same, wherever you go they always hit on the blonde"
 
I decided not to comment and approached Israel.
 
She looked at me with a stunned expression but recovered instantly, "Hello Kei from team Sparkling Dragons, how are you?"
 
I couldn't believe it, her character was too realistic, was this all programmed? "I'm here to ask you about game completion" I said.
 
She answered immediatelty, "You cannot complete the game" she was still smiling.
 
That wasn't what she told us earlier, I couldn't believe this, "You said..." 
 
"Things have changed" she said, "Before, you could complete the game by leveling up to level 10, but after the system error it has become impossible"
 
"Get used to it" the other guys who were talking to Israel earlier came around and surrounded her. "We were talking to her, so now if you don't mind." One of them grabbed Israel's hand, another grabbed her hair and sniffed it. Israel just laughed and told them to stop.
 
Casey stared at me like they were really weird. I felt like punching all of them, didn't they care at all if we couldn't leave? 
 
"I do mind" I said, "She's one of the computer programmed units in this game, she knows a lot more than any of us. I asked her a question, so why are you answering?"
 
"Is that so?" The guy who was talking the most was called Hector, he had a silver earring in his lip and some really tight shorts under a loose grey shirt. "What do you know, you're just a tiny nerd gamer who spends their life locked up in a room with your Mom feeding you everyday"
 
Then he grinned and pinched Israel's butt, she flinched and then laughed. Seriously, what kind of program was she, was this how she was designed by the programmers? With no dignity at all.
 
The guys kept touching her until she finally said "Stop. Not now, I have to answer these players"
 
"Do it later" Hector said, making sure I was listening, "This guy can spend his time dreaming of his little sister who's back in the real world"
 
Israel tried to break loose and smile at me but I walked away, what was she able to tell me.
 
"That's disgusting" Richard said, "How can a program act like that."
 
"Those guys are getting with a program instead of a real girl" Elsie said. "What's wrong with them"
 
"Don't mind them" A voice behind us said. We all turned around to see Warren with a big grin on his face.
 
"Warren" Casey said, she ran in for a hug like she was meeting an uncle.
 
"I'm glad to see you guys" Warren said, "I was wondering where you'd gone, I knew you'd turn up here sooner or later, but not at level 10. You guys have done a great job"
 
"Where have you been?"
 
It really was good to see him, I didn't know that it would be so. "How have you been Warren?" I saw that he was level 1, he probably just respawned here.
 
"I went to find out if we could change the program back to the previous one, the normal game where we could log out."
 
"I thought we could log out at level 10?" I said, "Wasn't that completion of the game?"
 
Warren looked at us and shook his head. "Sorry guys, it wasn't"
 
"Then what level do we have to get to?" Elsie said. "That's why there are levels right?"
 
"It doesn't work like that" Warren said, "I..."
 
Elsie butted in, "What do you mean it doesn't work, you said it does"
 
"With the new update the system changed immensely, completion of the game was not developed. Just now I went to a business meeting held with the programmers, we were all meeting at the southern mountains. There were about 6 of us programmers, among them were some who had contributed some material to this new update we are in now. All of us just happened to be beta testers for this game we designed."
 
My face went pale, I didn't like where this was going, even the programmers couldn't fix this?
 
"At the time, they never knew that there was no log out feature, they were just following orders from above, it just hadn't occurred to them that something so basic like a log out wasn't included."
 
I swallowed, "You mean....this whole thing comes from above? It was organized?"
 
Warren nodded, "The only explanation I can think of is that it was a grave mistake made on the part of the company designing the game."
 
"Otherwise..." I could think of something far worse,
 
"Yes" Warren nodded, "The other possibility is that it's deliberate."
 
"But who?" Richard said, "Who would want to trap a bunch of teenagers inside a virtual game? What could they possibly benefit from this?"
 
Elsie put her finger to her lips, "Someone cheated the system and forced the update, knowing that there was no log out. A few players level up at incredible speeds way beyond normal players. " She looked over at us, her eyes deep in thought and her mouth moving to pronounce inaudible words "Players try to reach level 10, believing that it will let them complete the game" There was a long pause as we all watched her expectantly.
 
"The high level players" Richard said "They're the suspicious ones" 
 
Elsie nodded beside him, "It's most likely that they are trying to rule over everyone else"
 
"Why" Casey sank to the ground, "I want to go home, can't we do anything? I'm so bored of this, why do we have to stay here? It's like we're doing homework everyday every hour for the rest of our lives."
 
"What right do they have to make us do these things?" Richard said, "I'm going to find these cheaters and..."
 
"Don't say it" Elsie said, "Please"
 
I really felt bad too, but I didn't think it was fair to say it out loud, it would only make everyone feel worse. Why did we have to be here, who's selfishness left us stranded here?
 
We fell silent for a while, gazing out into the distance.
 
Warren kept looking around, he finally opened his mouth to speak, there were no other players around us but he still spoke carefully. "I have something to tell all of you. This doesn't mean it's over" Warren said, "Theoretically, there might be one way to fix this..."
 
He instantly had our attention...

### Chapter Twelve
 
"It's to do with the system" Warren said, "If you want to revert the system to how it originally existed, you have to return the mainframe state to what it was beforehand"
 
"Huh?" Casey said, "What do you mean?"
 
Richard came in, "He means that the game has to be before it was before the last update was installed"
 
"Exactly" Warren said, "There's still a way out, the game remembers the levels of all players but disregards a lot of other extraneous information"
 
"Huh?" Casey said.
 
"He means that only the levels are remembered" Richard said.
 
"Exactly" Warren said, "So if you can revert the levels of all players globally, to the same as they were before the update, then you may be able to cancel the update and go back to the normal game"
 
"So..." Richard said, "All players need to revert their levels?"
 
"Yes" 
 
Richard looked to Casey, she nodded, "I understand, so everyone needs to go back to level 1?"
 
"Correct" Warren said.
 
"And it just may work?" Elsie said, "You're not sure. So we might go to all of this trouble based on a whim of yours?"
 
Warren bit his lower lip, "It's only a possibility that I have in mind from designing other games, that's just assuming that this game is the same as some other games that I have been involved with."
 
"It's the best chance we have" I said, I didn't know anything else.
 
Elsie crossed her arms and faced Warren, "And Warren, why are you only level 1?"
 
"He got killed" I said, why did she have to ask him that?
 
"I know" she looked at me from the corner of her eyes then returned her gaze back to him, "I'm asking Warren"
 
"I was walking out of the programmers meeting when one of them attacked me"
 
"A programmer attacked you?" I said.
 
"He is one of the high ranking players, I'm sure you know him"
 
Elsie immediately pulled out her menu and scrolled down the high score charts. 
 
"Here" Warren pointed to an area on the screen, 
 
Rank 8 - Sheila - Level 64
 
Now the levels of all the players had increased tremendously, level 64 was too high. Our combined level was only something around 20. How could their increase be so fast?
 
"It's because they're attacking other players" Warren said, "These top players have other players who support them, and help them make whole 'farms' of lower ranked players to feed on. These lower ranked players just keep providing diamonds for the higher level players. The spawning area you went to earlier was one such place, for certain high ranking players."
 
"And we have to defeat them?" Richard said. "If we want to make everyone's levels back to 1, we have to defeat them and make them level 1 again right?" 
 
"You're onto it" Warren said, "Exactly"
 
"There's a better way" Casey said, "Can't we just talk to them? If I'm a level 1 player and tell them about how we can all log out if we go to level 1, then surely everyone will listen. Everyone wants to leave right? Then if someone doesn't then all the other players can try and convince them together"
 
"May" Elsie said, "It may work, no one said it will work"
 
"Casey, you have a good point, but it's not going to work, because there will always be those who disagree with you" Warren said, "To leave this game, you have to become the strongest group of players in the game"
 
It was ironic that we had to become the strongest, number 1 was still the same on the high scores
 
Rank 1 - "Lahoe" Level 101 :
 
How was it possible for us to defeat such a high level? And who was this player, was he also a programmer? 
 
The sparkling green sword was behind his name, he was still in possession of it.
 
Then I thought of what Guizan told me, that I was somehow special and able to do amazing things. I didn't know what he meant.
 
Rank 10 - "Guizan" Level 35
 
I found his name, but looking at it didn't bring me any enlightenment. I still didn't know what to do, but the encouragement came from my teammates.
 
"We have to do it" Casey was usually so weak, but now she stood with confidence. "I'm only level one but I'll try"
 
"I'm sure we can defeat a few enemies" Richard said.
 
"Of course" Elsie smiled, "There's no problem, we just have to level up a bit right? Of course we can do it."
 
But I wasn't sure "What about leveling up quickly?" the fastest way to level was to attack other players, each conquest brought one diamond.
 
"Don't worry" Elsie said, "We won't attack other players" She put her hand on mine, "We'll find a way"
 
Warren smiled, "I have seen all sorts of teams formed in the short time this game came online, but you guys are one of the best teams that I've seen. You have good chemistry."
 
Casey smiled and turned away from us "Come on everyone, lets go" she said. "We're going to beat this game"
 
"Of course" Richard said, he went along with Elsie, and I picked up the rear.
 
It was great to be with these guys.
 
We were going to achieve it.

---

### Chapter Thirteen - Monster
 
I looked at my new stats, "Kei - level 15" It wasn't just me, all of us were getting quite high in our levels, we had defeated so many creatures that our experience points just kept rising. Most players in the game had their experience points on the rise, even those players who were lagging behind earlier. 
 
But Richard wasn't so sure. "I think that most players are still level 1" he said, "If there are players who are leveling fast, then there will be players who are not leveling as well" He shrugged, "It's just how this world works"
 
Besides, the last time we had a break from training, Elsie opened her menu and looked up the High scores again, just out of curiosity. She showed us that the top players had gone past level 150 now. "Lahoe" was almost at level 200.
 
In the time that we leveled five levels, they did 50. They were literally fifty times faster than us.
 
As we found new creatures we roamed far from the spawning area and were indirectly headed towards one of the small dots on the map, none of us really knew what it was but we hoped there might be a place to stay there. We were training all day and night and were getting really tired of it.
 
I doubted that I worked this hard even in the real world.
 
Just as I defeated a large mouse with a side blade attack that I almost mastered, Casey came over to me, she had confusion painted on her face.
 
"What is it?" 
 
"There's some players over there" she pointed to the horizon and sure enough I saw them as well, like little specks of dust on the horizon, but they were moving quickly towards us.
 
Richard and Elsie also stopped their combat and came over. "Who are they?" Richard squinted into the distance
 
"They look strong" Casey said. 
 
"They aren't, we are strong" Elsie said, "They can't be stronger than us" She grinned and pulled out her blade.
 
"We're not here to fight" I said, we were supposed to be making friends, not enemies. The fewer the enemies the better for us.
 
"Don't" Richard held up his hand, "If you go in they'll crush you"
 
"How do you know?" Elsie started preparing the skills she was going to use. "I've been wanting to fight some real players for a time now" She brushed the sword against her leg, "Now's a good time to test my skills"
 
"Don't fight them" I unarmed myself, making me vulnerable to their attacks, but we had to trust them here. 
 
"Don't do it Elsie" Casey said, 
 
Elsie looked around at us "Are you all scared to fight? If we want to make every player level 1, then we have to become the strongest. We may as well start now."
 
It was a bad idea to fight them now, in the middle of nowhere, what purpose would it serve. Even if it was only for practice...
 
Besides, they might be extremely strong players much higher than us in level. "I don't think it's a good idea, we shouldn't be attacking other players, it's not the way to do things."
 
Elsie stared once more into the horizon at the specks that were growing in size as they came closer. She finally let go and unwielded her sword. "Fine, you're right." She muttered, "There's no point"
 
As the players came closer we saw that there were also four of them. They were also in a team and were organized. We couldn't see their levels until they were right in front of us, but I could see that they were injured. Some of them were limping, and a few other players were getting slower and slower.
 
They probably had only been going fast as an act.
 
Before I knew it, Casey charged towards them, "We can ask them about a better place to practice" she said. She waved for all of us to follow her.
 
My legs moved beneath me as we ran towards the other players. Now almost all of their speed had disappeared and they were walking slowly towards us. I followed Casey until she slowed down, soon we were standing right in front of them.
 
I was astonished, they had been further out than us, but their levels were less than 10.
 
The player in the middle had green hair that came down to his shoulders. He crossed his arms and came over to us.
 
"You guys here know about the monster up ahead?" he said, his name was Crady, a level 11 player. He was the leader of the group Flootes, they had also banded together at the start. Their movement stats were higher than their others stats. 
 
"What monster?" Elsie said. She had already noticed his level and was stepping forward.
 
His eyes narrowed, "If we tell you about it, you better let us go" The others around him looked nervous, they weren't very comfortable with what was happening.
 
Talking to us...
 
"Where is this monster?" Elsie said, "What level is it?"
 
Crady looked around, then another player behind him came forward with his arms wide, "It was like this big, huge thing. I've never seen anything like it in any games, and I used to play all the time. Fangs the size of houses, and arms that can destroy anything."
 
Elsie was on edge, "Where is it? Where is it?"
 
"We're going West, if you let us go we'll tell you"
 
I suddenly realized what was happening,
 
They were afraid of us. Our levels were higher than theirs, so they were wanting safe passage.
 
Elsie looked at us, her eyes were asking for permission. "Can we fight this monster? Please?"
 
I shook my head, we should just train, not fight huge monsters.
 
But more importantly, this monster didn't exist. I was sure that it was made up by these players so that they could escape.
 
It made me sad to think that they were afraid of us, but what happened next made me shiver.
 
Elsie turned back to Crady. 
 
"Show us the monster" she said.
 
"Or else we won't let you go"

--- 

### Chapter Fourteen
 
"No" Richard said, "Elsie, we're not here to fight" 
 
The Flootes team looked at us helplessly. Crady was snarling at us. "We'll defeat all of you, don't make us do that."
 
It was an empty threat, I had been in this game long enough to know that there was now way his team could defeat us, just from levels alone we were too high for them to beat. One or two levels was already a huge gap in combat.
 
Elsie drew out her sword, "Go ahead, I just happened to be looking for diamonds"
 
I tried to stop her, but the scent of a fight seemed to overtake her. All she could see was victory and more levels.
 
They both ran into a fight instantly. Elsie swung her sword with her full force and Crady barely managed to block it. Then he tried to turn around and attack Elsie's other side, but she had already swung again, he didn't have time to defend himself and took the hit. His health points dropped, and he was one step closer to defeat.
 
And respawning.
 
I ran in to stop the fight, luckily the rest of Crady's team didn't jump in to attack us. They were also afraid of respawning at zero.
 
"What are you doing?" Elsie said, "We're on the same team"
 
"Stop attacking" I said, "They're other players as well, we can't attack them" It was just wrong to be doing so.
 
"Don't you want to become the strongest?" Elsie said, "Then you have to do this, that's what all the strong players are doing"
 
Then she said words that have always stuck with me, "It's not killing anyone, they respawn after they lose, so no one's dying."
 
I couldn't see anyone around me, only Elsie, and for some reason I was really angry. "It's killing a person" I said, "Why can't you see that, this isn't a game, it's a world, people suffer, people attack each other. There are real consequences. Why do you have to start that"
 
"You're an idiot" she said, "I'm only trying to leave this game, it's what you wanted, so why are you trying to stop me?"
 
I couldn't talk to her anymore. I turned away and looked at the others. Richard shrugged, Casey just smiled at me, she probably wanted me to stay calm and not start a conflict.
 
Crady took the opportunity and jumped in "I've been killed five times already, so I retrained my combat level 5 times to make it back to here,  Do you know how it feels to do it over and over again? It's boring." 
 
"But you've been attacking other players right? That's why you rushed to us" Elsie said.
 
"I learnt about players who attack other players from being attacked myself. And it's what you have to do to win this game, so of course I will do it." He grinned, the fear had completely escaped him, instead he stared at Elsie closely, "I have a list with the names of all the players who have attacked me. I will never forget them, and if you attack me, then I will put your name down as well. One day I will find those players and conquer them as they did to me, I'll show them that I don't take things lightly."
 
 
"It's a new word called respawn fear" he said. "Everyone in the respawning areas is using it."
 
Elsie looked at me, "That's what you're supposed to do in this game, that's why the stat is there, it says players conquered, completely clearly, so you're supposed to attack other players" She pointed her sword at me, "If you don't attack other players, then you're wrong in this game"
 
I couldn't smile or laugh it off, I wanted to say something back but I couldn't, I didn't know what to say.
 
"Then attack them" Casey said. "Try and defeat everyone, if that's what you want to do. I think we should listen to Kei here and let them go, there's no point attacking others."
 
Elsie shrugged, "I don't feel like it anyway, let's just go" She turned away and walked off, leaving everything behind for us to deal with.
 
"We won't forget this" Crady said, his teammates glanced at him and then at us. They looked like they were used to doing this.
 
"Yeah" I said, I let go of my weapons and put them in my inventory. Attacking another player was like attacking someone in real life. I couldn't live with myself if it happened.
 
"You are good guys" Crady said, "I will remember you, the Sparkling Dragons"
 
I waved bye, and set off after Elsie. Casey stood behind me waved little longer before catching up.
 
"That was great" she said as soon as she caught up, "You did really well back there"
 
"Thanks" I said, "You supported me back there, I don't know how things would have gone without your help."
 
"No problem" Casey smiled, "I'm always here for you Kei. Just like you're always here for me."
 
I smiled, she glanced at me and frowned.
 
"But Kei, you know that Elsie is wanting only something that you want as well, you both want to go home, she is just doing it the way she knows how to."
 
"This is true" I said, "Her way is faster than mine, but I just feel like it's...more..." I couldn't find the words, but I didn't like it.
 
She put her hand on my shoulder, "I know, that's why I supported you. Please understand that."
 
This was a side of Casey that I had never seen before, she seemed much stronger, like anything could be laid in her hands.
 
I smiled, I was lucky to have her here beside me.
 
Elsie came into the conversation. "We'll head to the East" Elsie said, "I heard from some other players that there are stronger creatures to train on, since that's what you want to do right?"
 
I nodded
 
"Well then our destination is over there" she pointed to the mountains in the distance. "Those mountains should have level 10 creatures, a bit more challenging than the level 5's around here.
 
"We're going to get stronger" Richard said. "I'm excited"
 
Elsie shrugged, "Yeah whatever"
 
Ever since then I wasn't on the same terms with Elsie. It felt like something big had come between us, maybe it was always meant to be, and whatever happened an obstacle would be created.
 
But it still hurt.

---

### Chapter Fifteen - "Don't disrespect me"
 
We had been walking for around five hours when Elsie turned to me. "Can I talk to you for a second?" she said. I looked around, Casey was far behind and growing tired, and Richard was charging ahead.
 
I nodded, "Sure"
 
"Great" Elsie sighed, "I'm just telling you this because I want to be honest with you"
 
"Yeah" I said, "Is this about the fight earlier?"
 
"No" she looked into my eyes and shook her head. "It's more than that"
 
"What do you mean" I felt a bit annoyed, was she thinking about me like this the whole time?
 
"You always decide on things without asking us about it" she sat down. "I don't want to say this, but I feel like I have to, you're always doing things and sometimes making the wrong decisions, of course some of them are right, but I would like you to ask us first." She frowned, "We're a team, right?"
 
I nodded, "Is this because I said I didn't want to attack them?"
 
"It's not just that" she said, "I don't want to go into details, it won't be good"
 
"Go into details" I really didn't know what she meant. I unwielded my weapons and sat down
 
She also sat down in front of me, forcing a smile. She held onto her weapons firmly. "For example, I didn't want to fight those players that attacked us first time, when Casey died"
 
Casey looked up, "Did you say something about me?"
 
"Nothing, don't mind us" Elsie said, "We're just discussing, don't worry we'll catch up to you" Casey shrugged and walked past us.  
 
I watched her walk past, "I didn't want to fight those players, and because you went in, we all had to. And then we lost Casey so had to go back and get her. We lost valuable training time because of it, we might all be a lot higher in levels"
 
"Okay" I said, "I'll discuss it with you from now on"
 
"And when we chose the name for our team" Elsie said, "I didn't want to force anything on the group, but you just came up with the name and we all had to agree or we'd look bad"
 
Sparkling Dragons, was this about Sparkling Dragons? "I asked everyone about it and they didn't seem to mind, you should have said something"
 
Her voice rose, she crossed her arms. "I couldn't tell you in front of everyone, it would just look bad"
 
"Then if you didn't care so much about looks maybe..." I was starting to get really annoyed,
 
"Stop it" she said, "Don't speak to me like that"
 
"Like what?"
 
"Don't disrespect me, just because Casey and Richard like you so much you think you can say that kind of stuff so freely"
"What stuff? Are you upset at all of the small things like what name our team has?"
 
"Don't lie" she said, "It's your team, not ours, and the name is just one thing"
 
I couldn't stand it anymore. I stood up.
 
"I'm sorry" she said, her tone suddenly changed and became a lot more quiet. "I just wanted to be upfront about it, are you okay?"
 
"Yeah" I said, "Thanks for telling me" I walked towards the others, they had moved quite far ahead.
 
"You're being rude" Elsie said, "My boyfriend in the real world would always ask me before doing things, and he wouldn't just walk away like that"
 
Did she not stop talking? "Does he wipe your butt for you too?" I said. "I thought we were done. If you're going to bring in the real world, then go back to your boyfriend."
 
"That's what I'm trying to do" she said, "Can't you see that? That's why we're having this talk now, so we can work better as a team, but you don't want to listen"
 
"Are you so vain that you can't even see what's happening? I'm trying my best here as well" 
 
"That's why I'm telling you" Elsie said.
 
We stared at each other in silence. 
 
"Okay" I said, "Fine, thank you, I think we should carry on now, are we in understanding?"
 
"Yeah" she smiled, "Sure" I ran to catch up with the others without looking back. A moment later Elsie ran past me and towards Richard. After I caught up to Casey we walked side by side without saying much.
 
"Are you okay?" she said. "You seem so quiet"
 
"Yeah" I said, I watched up ahead as Elsie nudged Richard in the chest and laughed about something with him. He blushed and smiled, then said something back, she laughed and pushed him. He touched her hair and whispered something.
 
She burst out laughing even louder. She made a glance in my direction and caught my gaze looking at her. I quickly looked down in embarrassment.
 
"They're close aren't they?" Casey said. 
 
"Yeah, they seem to get along really well" 
 
We kept walking along as if nothing happened. Elsie was acting completely normal, and I wasn't sure if I was, but it all felt like a big lie. What had happened just now?
 
It was a big argument, but no one really knew it happened, Casey and Richard didn't know about it, and to some extent I thought maybe I didn't anymore either.
 
Where was it burning? What was fueling it?
 
Our lives progressed and before we knew it we were level 30. Casey was still a few levels behind, but we kept progressing without dying to anything.
 
I was lucky to not be attacked by anyone, all of us were.
 
But there were bigger enemies in other places we didn't yet know about...

### Chapter Sixteen - "She's not my type"
"I like Elsie" Richard said. He had pulled me aside after the training and talked to me privately. "She's always so helpful, and she's really smart. Besides, she's so good at fighting, which is kind of sexy."
 
I wasn't surprised the two of them had been getting closer and closer, Elsie was good at fighting, even if we were the same level and competed she would out fight me. But when we were training she made sure to give some of the creatures to us, that way we leveled up at the same rate.
 
"What do you think?" Richard said.
 
"I think it's great" The two of them looked good together, it would make them happy.
 
"Do you know what what means?" Richard nudged me and looked towards Casey.
 
"No, I don't think so" I didn't like Casey in that way.
 
"Why not?" he said, "She's cute right?"
 
"She is" I nodded, "But she's not my type"
 
"What do you mean?" he said, "I think she likes you"
 
Casey was was collecting firewood for us to make the fire, but she was dropping a few sticks and had to go back and get them. We did talk quite a bit, and she seemed to enjoy my company. But I didn't know if she actually liked me.
 
"Of course she likes you" Richard said, "That's what girls do when they're interested, you've got all the signs"
 
"What are you guys talking about?" Elsie walked over to us and sat down with her legs crossed. "Hmm?"
 
"Just about Casey and Kei" Richard said, "Don't you think they would be a good match?"
 
Elsie nodded, "Yeah that would be great, I think she likes you too Kei, and then we can have two couples" She looked at Richard and grinned, "That would be weird"
 
"Yeah, but it would be fun"" 
 
"It's just natural" I said, "Because we're spending so much time together, we're getting to know each other a lot better than we usually would" I suddenly had a great idea. I could cook something on the fire, when Casey wasn't there, maybe she would be glad to have it.
 
I blushed at my own thought, since when did I have thoughts of pleasing Casey? Was it really as Richard and Elsie said? Did she really have feelings for me as well? If she didn't then I would just look really bad.
 
But I never got the chance to do anything, as soon as the fire was set up, Richard sensed someone approaching. We had specialized our skills, I was going for ranged combat, Casey was for melee, as well as Elsie, and Richard was going for battle awareness. 
 
He pointed to the mountains all around us, in the distance the sun was still setting on the tip of the mountain and just enough light was left over to radiate the shadow of a figure running towards us extremely fast.
 
"Is he alone?" Elsie said. "I can take care of him"
 
"Yes" Richard said. "But don't attack him, his player status is set at normal, he hasn't conquered any other players"
 
We all looked at each other. "So you mean he's just like us, he hasn't attacked other players?"
 
Up to now we had run into a lot of other players but both parties had not wanted to risk losing the battle and backed off. We were the only group we knew about who had the status players conquered - 0, Everyone else had been attacking other players. So to find another player who had also not attacked other players was extremely rare. And the higher the level you got to, the rarer it became.
 
He wasn't a particularly high level, in fact he was level 12, the level at which the fastest speed boots could be equipped. It almost seemed like he had leveled only to be able to run at the fastest speed.
 
We all got our combat pose ready, even if he hadn't attacked other players up to now, we couldn't be too cautious. If we died, all of our levels would be reduced back to 1 and we would have to retrain everything that took days to level up.
 
The figure kept approaching us, and finally slowed down once he was quite far away. He walked the rest of the journey towards us. "Hi" he said, "I mean no harm, I'm only looking for the spawning area"
 
The spawning area? But it was on our maps right? How come he didn't know that.
 
"It's over there" Casey pointed, "You see the pointy mountain, you go behind it and travel straight for two days, then you'll get to it"
 
His level was only 12, and his name was Fermol, he scratched his head and laughed, "Wow, I really don't know anything"
 
"Where did you come from?" I said, "How come you don't know about the respawn area? It's where we all started this game."
 
"It's where you all started" he said, "But it's not the center of this map"
 
he had said you instead of us, did that mean that he didn't start where we did?
 
"You aren't the only players in this game"  Fermol said, "There are countless spawn points all over the map, I think the last time I checked, there were over 50 of them."
 
Over fifty? So we weren't the only ones playing the game? It had been connected internationally for all of the traffic.
 
"The map is large enough to fit all of those fifty spawning points in?" I said, "We've been travelling for two weeks and we still haven't found a single spawning area.
 
"That's because this map is bigger than the Earth" Fermol said. "It's really spread out"
 
My jaw dropped, somehow we had been assuming that after crossing these mountains there would be nothing behind them. But to hear that it was bigger than the Earth was impossible.
 
Fermol continued, "I started at a different spawning point, so that one is indicated on my map, but I don't know where the other ones are, until I go to them, then they will be saved in my map.
 
"But it's a dangerous place" Casey said, "Everyone is attacking the lower level players for easy diamonds, if you get attacked you will lose the spawning area on your map, and your levels will be gone."
 
"Don't worry" he said, "I'm pretty strong"
 
Something amazing was on my mind, I had to ask him. "Are the other players able to log out?" Just because we couldn't didn't mean that other players wouldn't be able to as well.
 
Fermol shook his head, "Unfortunately the glitch was a global one, so it affects every player in the game. That's why I'm here as well"
 
I could feel myself going pale, we all became silent. Our plan had been to make every player level 1, but we just found out that there were fifty times as many players than we expected. How could we make those players all level 1?
 
It seemed impossible.
 
Casey explained our plan to Fermol. He nodded, "That seems like an interesting solution, I mean theoretically it should work.
 
"Yes" Casey nodded, "We just need everyone to agree to it"
 
"Yes" Fermol said, "But practically it just won't, you will never be able to convince every single player to become level 1 again. especially the high level players who are wreaking havoc. They won't want to lose the things they've worked hard to gain."
 
Casey looked stumped, so Fermol laughed, "I'm just joking, you have to try your best, that's how I used to get through my life. Now I'm here and I'm trying to connect the spawning areas, so we can try and find out who the player that cheated is. "
 
He was saying things out of the likes of a normal player, he seemed to know a lot more. Richard caught on as well, the vibe he was giving off was too extraordinary.
 
"Who are you?" Richard said, he came closer to Fermol and crossed his arms. "Tell me, how do you know so much?"
 
"I'm a programmer" Fermol said
 
"The fifth one" 
 
---

### Chapter Seventeen
 
"I'm one of the initial Programmers" Fermol said, "I happened to be logged in to do some testing, that was when the cheating came into play." He sat on the ground and looked to the sky, "Man I still regret that I was chosen to test the game at that time, it was such a bad glitch, this is more like a virus affecting the whole system. I wish I could have been lying in bed with my wife."
 
He looked at Richard, "Do you know that no one in the world was expecting something like this to happen, I mean it happens in real games all the time, but no one even considered that it would happen in a virtual game. It came suddenly and shocked everyone."
 
"So why are you trying to find who cheated?" Richard said, "Is that what going to the spawning areas will teach you?"
 
"We have our own reasons" Fermol said, "We had big discussions at the Programmer's headquarters on the far west, and we found that maybe by finding the player who cheated, we can back track him only, and then reverse the system into a glitch free one. Then everyone should be able to log out"
 
It was good to hear that someone else was trying to solve this problem as well, I felt lucky to have guys like Fermol around, who actually knew what was happening.
 
Then he turned to us, "This is a little cruel, but in theory, I believe that the player who cheated did so deliberately, knowing what would happen"
 
I was shocked, "You mean that they did it to stop us from logging out? They wanted us to be trapped here like mice?"
 
"It was triggered deliberately, that's what I think" Fermol sighed. "It's such a sad thing to happen, but it's also our fault, for allowing such a devastating fault in the system. I'm sorry"
 
"You don't need to apologize" Elsie went over to him and put her hand on his shoulder, "It's just something that has happened, and we're going to solve it, just like we've been solving everything else. The problems will disappear"
 
Fermol smiled,"It's good to be able to talk for the first time in a while, I haven't run into nice players like yourselves in a while, I've been travelling for a long time now."
 
"How are you going to find the player who cheated?" I said.
 
"It's to do with the spawning times, we know where the player was when they activated the code, and what level he was. We just don't know who it was, so I'm just traveling to your respawn area to see whether it was there. We also have high ranked players like Guizan and MasterMu helping us, in case things get sticky."
 
"We met Guizan" I said, "At the spawning area"
 
"Ah yes" Fermol said, "He said he met a special player there"
 
"That was Kei" Richard said, "Apparently Guizan told Kei that he was one of the five most important players in the game, that he had something that others don't have"
 
"That was you?" Fermol looked me up and down. "How come?"
 
"I don't know either" I wanted to laugh, it was all a bit hilarious.
 
"Anyway, I don't know but Guizan knows what he is doing, and he's really experienced at this game, we listen to his advice a lot of the time. He's helping us find the cheater." Fermol sat down, he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. Then he moved his hand to check something. 
 
"Ah" he said, "I always think I'm still in the real world and wearing a watch, I keep forgetting that it's not there"
 
"Same" I said.
 
"When we were analyzing information, we learnt that the cheating player used the cheat to jump up in levels. They were level 5, and instantly jumped to level 10."
 
Level skipping, it was one of the hardest things to catch. 
 
"That's why we have Guizan, he's going to help us take down one of the top players. He's heading over towards the mountain with the flat top" Fermol pointed towards a mountain in the distance, it had a flat top, like a tabletop.
 
"Guiza is going to attack this player for us, she's the player ranked number 7"
 
Elsie immediately opened up her menu and went to the High Rankings.
 
7 - Sheila - Level 120
 
"That's her, Sheila" Fermol said, "She helped the rank 1 player get the special item. If we stop her, we can stop a lot of the problems"
 
"You mean the green sword?" I said, "By special item, you mean the Lime Green sword awarded to the first player that reaches level 10?"
 
"Exactly" Fermol said. "But the Lime Green sword is not held alone, it was only through the help of all of the other players, a team, that it had been obtained.
 
I looked at the top name in the high rankings list. 
 
1 - Lahoe - Level 205 
 
His level was growing further apart from the rest of the players.
 
"When the lime Green sword is obtained by a player, the whole map trembles" Fermol said, "And when it changes hands it trembles as well. It has the power to chew up a whole army, that's why the player with it can level up so fast with it"
 
"Is he with a team as well?" I said, "Lahoe"
 
"He is" Fermol said, "Or he was, the other members assisted him and helped him level up early, and then he helped them once he got the sword. But after a while he got bored and started playing his own games."
 
I couldn't imagine this player, Lahoe, the strongest player in the game, what kind of personality did he have?
 
"He's nothing special" Fermol said, "He's just strong and ruthless. We can't attack him directly because of the sword, so we will weaken him first by attacking his team members who helped him obtain the sword, Sheila is one of them, and MasterMu is another."
 
"So Guizan is going to defeat them?" Richard said. "Can't you just cheat and make them reset their levels?"
 
"If we could have done it that easily we would have a long time ago, now we are using Guizan's help. He has a special quality in him that only long term serious gamers would achieve."
 
I wanted to watch this duel now, to see these incredibly strong players in action.
 
"When is this duel happening?" I said.
 
"You want to watch the duel?" Casey said, "Isn't it dangerous?" she looked to Fermol.
 
"Maybe in about three days" Fermol said, "We can't be sure, but it depends on when Sheila will be there"
 
"Wow" It was all I could say. I hoped Guizan would win, with him on our side everything seemed possible, that the real world might truly come back. Guizan was playing this game intently, purely to help all of us get out of it.
 
"I'm going to watch it" I said. I turned to Elsie "Is that Okay?"
 
She nodded, "Yeah, I want to watch it too"
 
"I have to go guys" Fermol said, "Just one last request from me now, please don't tell others that I am a programmer, because everyone will start complaining about the game, or begging for things from me. I need to do his job, especially because we can't return to the real world, I need to help everyone leave. 
 
I was astonished by his integrity, it was something I didn't see very often.
 
We waved him good luck, I truly hoped he found the cheater, it would help us leave the game.
 
That night we slept by the fires, I felt hopeful for the first time in a while and slept easily. Things seemed to be moving along other than where we were. I gazed up at the stars, there were stars in this world, it seemed to be the first time I realized how beautiful they were. I always had something on my mind, but tonight was calm.

### Chapter Eighteen - Training # 2
 
When the sun rose Casey cried like a chicken. She woke all of us up and made us pack our bags. 
 
"Come on" she said, "We have to get closer to the flat mountain"
 
She had heard about the duel and was also eager to see it. It was like we were going to see the local football game. Except nothing about this was local, there were no people around us for miles and miles.
 
We had arrived at the base of the mountain, Richard looked around at us, "I think we should sit down now and have a rest."
 
We agreed to rest for a while, Casey brought out some cooked meals for all of us. It was really useful that we were able to hold the things we cooked. And she had started to level her cooking skills as well as combat. Her cooking was really starting to become something amazing.
 
"This is it" Richard was smiling and rubbing his hands together. He looked up at the mountain in front of us with a bowl of rice curry in his hands.
 
"Are we going up there?" Casey said. She peered up the rocks, there were rocks everywhere, some were jutting out, some were flat. 
 
"There's a track going all the way up there" Elsie said, "Actually there's sixteen tracks all around the mountain that go to the top."
 
"How come you know this?" Richard said.
 
"I read the map information" Elsie said, she looked at Richard, "Didn't you?"
 
"I did too" he said
 
"So you know it as well?" she said
 
"Yeah" he nodded.
 
They both burst out laughing, "We both knew it"
 
I sighed, I may as well draw hearts around them. It was good that they were together, but it made me look at Casey differently.
 
"You guys" Richard said, "We'll camp here for a while, we've come three days too early for the duel"
 
"Hey I was wondering" Casey put her hand over her eyes and looked to the sky. "How do you know when the duel day is?"
 
Richard let out a big laugh, "It's all in the manual" he said, "Didn't you read it"
 
"I read it" Elsie said, she gave him a look "I know whats in it" They both started giggling like couples again.
 
"It's from the way the winds change" I said, "When Fermol described it to us he said that it was a West wind. The wind becomes a West wind every twelve days, so we know that the next West wind is three days away."
 
"Wow" Casey looked at me impressed, "You mean you actually think that far?"
 
"Of course" Richard said, "We have to, we're in a different world now, where the rules are different. I don't have to wake up and study, or go to work, instead we have other things to do, and not to do"
 
We found a place where there were creatures to level on and continued to gain diamonds. I used all of mine on leveling up, I didn't want to give others an excuse to attack me. Richard and Elsie did the same, but Casey held onto hers. She split half of them into cooking skills, and the other half into leveling. The rest she held for something to buy the next time we got to a store.
 
"What do you want to buy?" I said
 
She shook her head, "I can't tell you"
 
So we spent the days repeating ourselves and leveling up. By the end of it I was level 45, Elsie was level 56, Richard 47, and Casey was level 22. 
 
For the first day we didn't see anyone. I called out loud to the others whenever I had something to say. I yelled at the top of my voice, and somewhere on the other side of the mountain Casey, Elsie, or Richard would answer. At night we all gathered and told stories. Casey set up a fire and cooked us all something to eat. She said she really enjoyed cooking, and we were enjoying the new meals that she came up with.
 
The stories we told were usually of our real lives. I imagined what I would be doing right now if I was back at home. I would be studying and preparing for my mid semester test. Casey said she would be doing the same. Richard told us how he worked as a builder, he had done an apprenticeship and was just looking to go pro. There was no internet where he was going, so he wanted to use it as much as he could.
 
But that was when he logged into this game.
 
"How about you Elsie?" Richard said, "What would you be doing now?"
 
"Not much" Elsie said. "My life was boring, I don't really want to talk about it"
 
"Sure" Casey said, "You don't have to, just say anything you are comfortable with."
 
In our own ways, all of us had been brought to this game, for most of us it was our first time, but we were all stuck in it now together.
 
The next day we caught sight of a group of players walking towards the mountain. Richard found them and told us to come and watch.
 
"Are they just walking past?" I hoped that was the case.
 
"No, they've started climbing the mountain." Richard said, "It might take them a few hours to reach us up here, but they will be here."
 
"Should we attack them?" Elsie said.
 
I tried to hide a frown of disagreement but Elsie caught it. "Do you think we should attack them?" she walked off.
 
"Let's wait here" Richard said, "We don't know their levels, they could be a lot stronger than us"
 
Casey looked worried, "What if they attack us first? Will all our efforts disappear?" 
 
"Don't worry" I said, "I'll talk to them" I thought that talking to them would be the best, the others eventually agreed with me. 
 
I went down to meet them alone. I made sure to hold my weapons and have my fastest speed equipment, just in case things didn't go well.
 
I could only hope for the best. I trundled over roots and through bushes as I got lower in the tree line. My sword felt heavy, I didn't think I could swing it properly if I tried. The trees were shaped like dark giant umbrellas that held out the rain. 
 
I walked and walked until I heard footsteps in front of me. There was a woman holding a torch, she screamed when she saw me and ran back.
 
I heard voices behind her, it seemed like a lot of people. They were scrambling and shouting.
 
"There's someone in front of us" 
 
"Carry your weapons"
 
"Can you see him?"
 
"Is it a player or a creature?"
 
Then the woman reappeared with the torch, she pointed it straight at my face, I couldn't see anything, she moved the torch over me.
 
"Don't worry" she said.
 
I felt my breath coming back to me. I didn't want to die here, it had taken so long to come this far.
 
"It's not a player, it's a creature" 
 
---

### Chapter Nineteen - Super Earls
 
I held up my hands in innocence.
 
"What are you saying?" Another player came beside the woman, "He's another player, he's only wearing level 1 equipment."
 
"This is going to be easy" One of them said.
 
"I only came here to talk to you, the rest of my group is higher up the mountain" I wanted to make things clear between us as soon as I could.
 
"Don't attack him" Another girl came forward, "Don't attack other players, it's not humane." She put her arms around her team mates, now that the torch was out of my face I could see that were all much lower level than I was, close to the 25 to 30 range. Even if I was by myself I would still be able to defeat them.
 
But I wasn't here for that.
 
I saw that there were five of them, the lady with the torch in the front, three guys behind her armed with gnarly looking modern weapons, and a blonde girl in the back with a ponytail. She was the one holding out her hands to stop them from attacking.
 
"I'm not here to fight" I said. I brought out my weapons and dropped them on the soil underneath us. "Why are you climbing this mountain?"
 
"That's got nothing to do with you" One of the guys said, crossing his arms and holding his sword out.
 
"Thats enough Sammu" the blonde girl said, "You need to learn some manners" Surprisingly her voice carried a lot of strength, he put his sword back in its sheath and stared back at me with cold eyes.
 
"Sorry about them" she said to me, "They're afraid of any new players"
 
"No we're not Suze" the lady at the front said, she closed her torch and put it back in her inventory. 
 
The blonde girl walked towards me, "You're asking us why we're climbing the mountain?" Her team all looked at each other, as if unsure of what to say.
 
"We got news from one of our friends that there was going to be a duel up here between two high level players, we just wanted to see it."
 
"How about you?" One of the boys said. 
 
I shrugged, "I'm the same, I know one of the players in the duel, so I wanted to witness it" 
 
Suze grinned, "Who did you hear it from?"
"From Fermol" I said
 
"I knew it" the boys said, "Fermol tells everyone, he can't keep a secret"
 
Suze walked beside me, "Fermol's an old friend of ours, the boys here are quite fond of him" We started walking up the path towards the summit. All of the hostility from earlier had disappeared. 
 
I realized that they had just been afraid of the exact same thing that I was, of dying and re spawning with all of the levels reset to 1. 
 
"You're from a team called the Sparkling Dragons?" she said, when I nodded she grinned again, her cheeks had dimples which made her face look thin. "Wow, that's original, we're called the Super Earls"
 
She introduced me to her teammates, "That one with the weird teeth is Karl, that one with the hat is Eilish, the guy with long legs is Spaz, and the girl with the weird voice and holding the torch is Linda."
 
She held out her hand, "And I'm Suze, short for Super Zoel. My real name is Zoel, but I like Suze better."
 
I took her hand and shook it. All of her teammates seemed really relaxed and comfortable with my presence. 
 
"Come and meet my team" I said, I led them up the path and towards an area of smoke. I was glad that they weren't hostile players and were just like ourselves, coming to the mountain as tourists.
 
Elsie came out and greeted them. Karl, Eilish, and Spaz ran over to hug her. Elsie was surprisingly open to it, and she smiled to Linda.
 
Then Richard came out, he greeted everyone and told them that Casey was making a meal, everyone would be able to join us. The atmosphere was really great. The Super Earls loved Casey's dishes. And just like the night before, we all sat around the fire and talked into the night.
 
They were sitting on one side of the fire, and we were sitting on the other. Everyone had already introduced themselves and said all of their greetings, now the conversation was becoming deeper.
 
"Do you think it's going to be a big fight?" Spaz said. "I hope we didn't walk all this way for nothing"
 
"Don't ask questions like that" Suze said, "We're here to study as well" She turned to us, "Do you know about the Lime Green sword?"
 
"Yes" I said, "Fermol told us"
 
"Oh Fermol" Suze whined, "He tells you everything and then we don't have anything to tell you"
 
"The programmers are planning to take the group down right? Then they can take the top ranked players down one by one" Casey grinned in pride at being able to recount it.
 
"Exactly" Suze said, "We've got a plan, and we're eventually going to get out of this game"
 
I felt like she was saying the things that had been on my mind recently.
 
"This is the first step" she said, "To the dominoes crumbling"
 
I raised my glass of water, "To the first step"
 
Everyone did the same, "To the first step"
 
Singing and dancing started to emerge, it was a really joyous atmosphere. For the first time in a long time, I felt really relaxed. I went to one of the empty corners and sat down to watch everyone else.
 
Suze came over and sat down by me, "Do you mind?" she said.
"Go ahead" 
 
She moved closer to me, I could smell her skin on the bottom of my breath, it smelt like special flowers she had rubbed in.
 
"I can see she's your combat specialist" she pointed to Elsie.
 
"Combat specialist?" I said.
 
"She's always on guard, even when she's dancing, she's looking around to make sure everything is okay, and she is the only one who has her right arm free, just in case something happens and she needs to wield a weapon."
 
I was impressed, "Do you read that far into everyone?"
 
"Not really" she said, then she leaned towards me and whispered in my ear, "Only some people"
 
I blushed, for some reason I wasn't sure of. 
 
She pulled away, "You know, every team has specialists, every player is one part of the pyramid and specializes in bringing something to the team"
 
I nodded.
 
"That's how the Lime Green Sword was attained, the teamwork was excellent and faultless, they were called the Revolutionists."
 
"That's the team that was the highest rank?"
 
"It wasn't something that came about suddenly" Suze said, "It was organized for a long time beforehand"
 
"Really?" I said.
 
Suze didn't answer, instead she looked over to the dancers, a calm air had overtaken her, she seemed to have something on her mind. 
 
"Look at Karl there, he's our weapons specialist, he's also our organizer, he finds the best combinations of weapons for us and helps us use them. It's more useful to have him than another fighter, the team is more organized."
 
From the way Suze was saying it, I could tell that she had had this on her mind for a while.
 
"And Spaz is an archer, him and our melee attacker, Linda work together to take down any enemy. Eilish stands behind and uses a one handed sword to deliver strong blows."
 
I nodded. 
 
"And me" Suze turned to me, I'm our navigator, and I like to call myself a peace specialist"
 
"Peace?"
 
"I don't like to fight other players" she said, "I'm against it"
 
"We're the same" I said.
 
"I know" Suze said, "That's why I feel like I can trust you guys"
 
It was really strange, but suddenly I felt ashamed of my team, Richard Casey and Elsie, I know that Suze was telling me this to make me proud of our uniqueness, but I couldn't feel anything unique about us. I was ashamed of the tension and the arguments. The Super Earls were a much lower level team than us, but if we were to fight, I didn't dare think what would happen.
 
Suze leaned over again, this time closer. "Anyway, that's enough talk about specializations, I just wanted you to be aware of it"
 
Then she put her hand on my thigh. "What are you doing tonight?"
 
"Nothing much" I said.
 
She came closer, her hair was just in front of mine, and I could see her lips, all the small creases and rosiness. "Do you want to do something then?"
 
Her hand moved up my leg.
 
I stood up, "Sorry, I can't"
 
"How come?"
 
"There's someone that I like"
 
Suze looked at me for a while, then her eyes widened and she smiled, before returning back to normal. "Good on you Kei, don't let a stupid woman like me touch you then"
 
"I don't mean it like that" I said.
 
"I know, I admire your strength, I wish I was like that as well"
 
When I looked back at the fire, the dancers were touching each other. Casey and Richard stood aside and were talking quietly. Elsie had long ago gone to sleep. 
 
I felt a little bit proud to have them on my team, the feelings earlier had disappeared. Casey was so good at cooking, and Richard could see things so far away, his navigational skills were exceptional. Elsie was also really good at combat, I could only watch and admire how dexterously she swung her sword.
 
We were the Sparkling Dragons.
 
Suze nodded off to sleep. "You guys are amazing" she said. "We'll see you tomorrow"
 
The Super Earls all fell asleep quickly, as if they had used all of their strength up. I went over to Casey and Richard.
 
"Tomorrow is another empty day" Richard said, "We need to train to make our levels higher, that's what lets us progress in the game"
 
"I'll make a special meal for everyone" Casey said.
 
"You guys are awesome" I said.
 
The next day we woke up and there was snow all around us.

### Chapter Twenty

The next day we woke up and there was snow all around us.
 
It had started snowing shortly after we went to sleep and continued through the night. Elsie was already up and training. When I finally woke up she had come back from defeating 30 creatures and was now taking a break. She sat down to eat breakfast with us.
 
I looked around, the scenery from yesterday was gone, it was covered by a thin white blanket of snow. The rocks that we climbed over, the trees, they were stuck in a silent frozen picture.
 
Just like us.
 
The summit where the duel was to happen was snowed over. There wasn't a single footprint, apart from where Elsie had been stepping.
 
I stood on one of the rock, the weather was calm, and there were no clouds in the sky, the snow had stopped, but what was left of it was on the ground. It stretched out all around until as far as I could see. I didn't know where we had come from, or where the spawning area was, but it didn't matter, because it all looked the same.
 
"It's lovely isn't it?" Suze came over beside me. She paused for a moment before continuing, "I just wanted to apologize for saying those things last night"
 
"What things?' I said
 
"Do I have to say it?"
 
"Yes" I said.
 
"For asking to be with you last night, I just thought it might be fun. But I didn't know you liked someone"
 
I didn't answer.
 
"I think I know who it is that you like" she said
 
I just stared into the snow, I didn't know what to say, I didn't even know how I felt.
 
"Are you okay? You're so quiet this morning"
 
"Yeah" I was.
 
"It's tonight you know" she said, "The duels' happening tonight"
 
"And what's happening afterwards?" I said, "Are you going to stay here?"
 
"If I do, then will you be happy?"
 
"Yes" I said.
 
"You know, you're such a great guy Kei." Suze said, "If you were on our team and I saw you everyday, I don't know If I'd be able to hold myself back"
 
I nodded.
 
When we got back to breakfast everyone was giggling. 
 
"What were you two doing" Richard said.
 
"Yeah" Spaz said, he had noodles dangling from his mouth.
 
Casey didn't look at me, she hurriedly packed away the lunch dishes and pots.
 
"We were just looking at the view" Suze said.
 
"Looking at the view" Eilish made it sound weird and everyone burst out laughing.
 
Except Casey. "Have you two eaten?"
 
"Yes" I said.
 
"Good" she didn't look at me and packed away the materials. "I'm just going to clean up then, don't mind me"
 
"Are you okay?" I said, she seemed rushed, and a bit cold.
 
"Yes" she said. "Don't mind me"
 
I shrugged and brought out my weapons to begin training. The duel was going to happen in the afternoon, so I would get some things prepared beforehand.
 
"Look over there" Linda ran over to us pointing behind her.
 
We peered over and saw about six more figures. They had also started climbing the mountain using one of the sixteen tracks. They would come to the summit and find us here.
 
"They're hunters" Linda said.
 
"What does that mean?" I said.
 
"You guys haven't run into them yet" Suze said, "Consider yourself lucky"
 
Karl said, "Hunters are specialized in attacking other players"
 
"But they might be lower levels than us"
 
Karl shook his head, he was really knowledgeable about it, as a weapons specialist it was common information "The hunter skill makes it more efficient to attack other players" You don't want to go close to them." The Super Earls had already scattered to clean up their belongings.
 
"So what do we do?" Richard said. "If we outnumber them it should be fine right?"
 
"They seem to be extremely high level players" Karl said, he pointed and showed Richard something. Richard opened his mouth, "What? Level 100?"
 
My jaw dropped, how were we going to fight level 100 players?
 
"Should we run?"
 
"It's no use" Karl said, "They've already seen us"
 
He slumped to the ground. "In this kind of situation there is almost no escape, they are hunters, coming to look for low level players, and they are also extremely powerful. Use up all of your diamonds guys, maybe then they won't attack us."
 
"What if they're just coming to watch the duel as well?" Suze said.
 
Karl nodded. "Maybe, it's possible, we can only hope so"
 
"Can I talk to them?" I said.
 
They all stared at me in silence.
 
"Kei's really good at that" Casey said, "Maybe he can turn them"
 
Everyone stared at Casey. And then burst out laughing.
 
"There's no way, have you met hunters before? No matter what level, they're greedy little people with tiny hearts." 
 
Karl went out to look where the hunters had gone, then he came back with a fearful expression. "They're moving really fast, through the trees. They've already entered the treeline."
 
In a few minutes they had already progressed halfway up the mountain. At this rate even if we started running we would be caught in a few minutes. Besides, there was nowhere to hide, all around us was flat for as far as the eye could see.
 
There was only to sit still and await our fate.
 
Karl brought out his weapons, everyone else did the same.
 
"All of you, try and follow my orders" he said, "I'm experienced at combat, and we have the upper hand as far as location goes, we need to go on them first."
 
"We have the upper hand" Spaz scoffed, "Now that's funny"
 
"Just do as you're told" Karl sharpened his sword and brought out some arches. "They're going to be here any minute now" he said. "Watch me, don't watch the trees. When I see movement I'll give the sign to charge" 
 
I listened intently like my life depended on it.
 
In a way this was my life

---

### Chapter Twenty One
 
We waited in the bushes dead silently for the hunters.
 
As soon as a twig moved or a branch rustled, I gripped my sword with all my strength. This thing might be able to help us survive. I didn't dare let my eyes wander from the spot the hunters came out of.
 
Instead of swords though, I heard voices,
 
"They're talking" Spaz broke the silence.
 
He didn't have to tell me, it was clear that they weren't serious, or that they weren't worried at all. I heard laughter, and singing. As if they didn't care about our presence.
 
Were they really strong, or did they not know we were here?
 
"Any moment now" Spaz whispered, "Don't let their tone fool you, they're highly experienced assassins"
 
I could feel Casey trembling next to me. I felt bad for having brought her here, she shouldn't have to go through this.
 
And yet we were only trying to survive. I was trying my best to help us get out of this game, this was the first step towards it. I moved my arm to put it around Casey, it was the least I could do. I just hoped that everything would turn out fine after this, and the four of us would be able to travel together.
 
My arm wrapped around Casey, she was wearing a soft white sweater that was warm, I could feel the ends of her hair brushing against my hand. I tried to cherish the moment, I had grown used to having her nearby.
 
The laughter grew louder, one voice was talking more than the others, I couldn't hear what it was talking about, but it sounded vulgar.
 
"Did you actually?"
"Yeah, and she was still screaming afterwards"
 
They all burst out laughing, they were right around the corner but I couldn't see them. The bush was in between us.
 
The steps stopped in front of us. They sounded like heavy copper boots.
 
"Someone's been camping here" A deep voice said. I could hear a sword being unsheathed, the sound of metal scraping on metal. "Watch it guys, someone might jump out at us"
 
Any moment now, I expected Spaz to yell out and start charging towards them, I was going to run out after him and the attack would start.
 
But he never did, the feet moved and the voices disappeared. I felt myself sigh in relief. They had just walked straight past us. I was glad we were all here together and nothing happened, but I also felt a bit dismayed that we hadn't gone out to attack them.
 
Maybe that's what Elsie felt all the time.
 
I waited for Spaz's movements to leave the bush.
 
"There's someone still there" Spaz said, finally. "We can't leave here"
 
I tried to look forward but I didn't see anyone, how was Spaz sure.
 
"There isn't anyone, we can go" Linda said, "Let's escape before they come back."
 
I heard a cough, it was probably Suze, it had her texture in it.
 
Then a voice spoke, it was one of the hunters. "I've never seen a talking bush before" he said, "Have you Jason?"
 
"No" another voice said, "Maybe it's a new feature in this game"
 
I tried to catch sight of who was in front of us, how many were there? 
 
"Come on out you guys, what are you doing in there?" 
 
Spaz moved, he untangled his leg and stepped out. I could hear the sound of his weapon dropping to the ground.
 
"Spaz" Suze said, she also jumped out and dropped her weapons, then we all followed and did the same. I saw five men standing before us. They had heavy grey capes on with solid metallic shoes. They had thick prickly looking beards and held gigantic swords.
 
"So there were nine of you in there" One of them spoke.
 
"It's just as Davies said" A shorter man walked forward to glance at us. I looked over them, they were all above level one hundred, with one man at 150. 
 
He grinned when he saw me staring at him. His name was Davies
 
"That's right" He said, "We're all hunters, we attack other players and steal their diamonds to level up for ourselves."
 
"Why do you go around telling everyone that" A guy called Grim said, "Just keep it to yourself can't you"
 
"They're such low levels that it's not worth attacking." Jason said, "And they've used up their diamonds already"
 
Spaz stood in front of us, he looked like he had already lost. I recognized that expression, it was the same one as the guys who were afraid of us had, the _____. We all watched Spaz in hopes that he would pull us out of this. But he didn't say anything, it was like his words had been stolen by these hunters.
 
"You're right" Davies said, "And we need to be in full performance to fulfill our mission." The others around him nodded. He had a way of speaking with his hand out, he turned to us, "How about you guys, do you like milk?"
 
"Milk?" Suze said.
 
"You know, the white stuff"
 
Milk? It didn't exist in this game, I hadn't seen it before.
 
"We don't have any" Eilish said. "I didn't know that it existed"
 
"We have it" Davies said, "And we're wondering if you want to drink it with us now"
 
The other hunters gave a more relaxed look, "We;ve finally come to the top of the mountain, we can reward ourselves now"
 
It took a while for me to become relaxed, the hunters made a table and sat down, then they brought out bottles and bottles of milk. I couldn't believe that I would be so happy to see bottles of milk, but I was.
 
"Where were the cows?"
 
"There are no cows, we found these from high level monster drops" Jason said. He smiled a lot at the girls, and they seemed to like him.
 
I found Davies more interesting. They sat around without weapons, as if there was not a fear in the world.
 
But hadn't they come here to attack us?
 
"We're here to witness a duel" I said, "Between two extremely powerful players"
 
"We're the same" Davies said, "But we will be eliminating the winner afterwards"
 
"What?" The area suddenly fell silent, only the snow continued to drift down around us like tiny pieces of paper.
 
"That's right" Davies said, "So we need to conserve our strength and eliminate the winner, that's our mission in coming here"
 
Grim looked annoyed, "You didn't have to tell them that"
 
"Oh it's alright Grim" Davies said, "What can they possibly do about it anyway?"
 
It was true, we had to listen.
 
Compared to them we were powerless.
 
---

### Chapter Twenty Two - Duel #1
 
The thought had never even occurred to me. Who was going to win the duel? If there was a loser it meant that there would also be a loser.
 
What happened if Guizan lost, did that mean that the hunters would eliminate the other strong opponent? 
 
So in the end, whatever the outcome, there would be no good or bad done to the game, the Green sword would still be equally distant from us.
Elsie came out of the shadows, she hadn't said a word ever since we saw the hunters. Now she walked in front of them and spoke. "Who hired you to do this?"
 
"Not me" Davies said.
 
One of the guys cupped his hand and whispered to Davies. "She's asking who hired us, not who's the boss"
 
Davies blushed and raised his head, "I mean, we can't tell you that, it's a secret."
 
Elsie grinned, "Am I right in guessing that it's the low level players who hired you, because they dislike the high ranked players?"
 
Davies laughed, "No, it's not" He was quiet and seemed to be proud of having this secret to keep. Being a leader was a new position for him.
 
"Then is it your boss, a hunter who wants recognition among other hunters as well?"
 
Jason looked her up and down, "Where are you suddenly coming up with all this attitude? This is our boss you're talking to"
 
"Then is it one of the merchant class players?" Elsie said. "Only they would be rich enough to pay you, and need your help because they don't have the combat level."
 
Davies shrugged, "I don't know, it's none of your business." He looked at Jason, Jason seemed to be emotionally in charge of the group. Jason nodded and Davies turned back to Elsie.
 
He watched her for a while, and the corners of his mouth curved up, as if forcing a smile. They must have known something about her that we didn't.
 
Elsie shrugged, "Okay" I was surprised by how calm she looked, all of the hunters were staring at her. And she looked really amazing, something in the way she talked demanded their attention. "If you guys are all just going to stare at me and not answer that's fine."
 
I could see why Richard was crushing on her. He seemed to see something in her that the rest of us didn't.    "Elsie is really smart" He said, "She knows why you're here"
 
Elsie smiled and gripped Richard's arm. 
 
"Is that so?" Davies said, he walked up to her without ever cutting off eye contact. "Don't you dare tell anyone about us being here, otherwise we might change our minds and get rid of you guys before this duel"
 
"Anyway" Jason tried to change the tone, "After the duel's done, we're going to jump in, and if we see you guys are still here afterwards, we'll attack you as well" He pointed to Elsie, "This one's a little cocky, so we need to knock her down a few notches"
 
"Don't worry" Elsie raised her hands in defence, "We won't be here anyway"
 
She trailed off and walked away.
 
Noon was almost here, from what Fermol told us so long ago, the duel was supposed to start at noon. The whole summit was engulfed in snow. We chose to sit on one of the bigger rocks to watch what was going to happen. 
 
I looked around me, it was flat, and the sun was right above us, burning the edges of the snow and making it crumple up completely.
 
Where were the two going to come from? If they were walking then we should be able to see them walking up one of the sixteen tracks to the summit. But for the past few days we had seen everyone from miles away.
I looked to the sky and saw a shadow appear, it quickly started descending and growing in size. Casey also pointed up, "Look, is that a person?" 
 
Now we were all looking up, "That must be him" Spaz said, "One of the highest ranked players in the game, Sheila"
 
"Him?" Linda said.
 
"Didn't you check?" Eilish said, "Sheila's a man"
 
The three guys in the Super Earls laughed. "Yeah, I don't know what he was thinking when he named himself"
 
As we watched, another dot appeared in the sky and quickly grew in size. That one must have been Guizan. I watched the dot grow and his figure grow familiar.
 
"Guizan" Casey called, "We're over here"
 
"Don't do that" Karl said, "We don't want to attract their attention, we only want them to have an honest duel for the winner"
 
"But don't you want Guizan to win?" Casey said.
 
"I want him to win" Karl said, "If it will bring more equilibrium to this game, if the legendary item, the lime green sword is destroyed, then there will be less of a gap between the strongest and the weakest players"
 
"But" he continued, "The lime green sword is an invulnerable item, meaning that it can't be destroyed"
 
"Someone else is going to take over and use it right?" Richard said 
 
"Right" Karl sighed. "That's why I'm just here to witness this match"
 
We had been supporting Guizan this whole time, to think that he might only be going for the legendary sword felt kind of bad.
 
Who was helping us leave the game?
 
I looked to the hunters, they were sitting right beside us and fell silent as soon as the dots appeared. Davies had a small grin on his lips, and his eyes were concentrated straight on where the two would land. He was looking ahead and concentrating.
 
I realized that for him this wasn't a scene to witness, this was his job. He had to defeat whichever remained at the end. There were ties within ties and connections within connections. I felt like the route to the top was tangled up like a big string ball without an obvious direction or path.
 
Davies may have felt the same, he held his sword tightly, and always wore his armor, even when he went to sleep. He didn't want to risk losing everything.
 
Sheila was about one hundred meters above us, he wore armor that glistened silver in the sunlight and had the insignia of famous tribes and chieftains. His hair was long and white, and his sword looked like a bone of a giant.
 
I had never seen any of the items before, how did they get all of them? What was it was like to be a high level player in this game? I suddenly felt admiration for these players, and I wanted to also have the things they did.
 
It's only a game, I told myself.
 
Once Sheila got closer to the land, he looked around and focused his eyes on us. There was hatred in them, and an intense dislike.
 
No smiles.
 
I looked at the hunters, all of them were staring back at Sheila with the same intensity. There was no friendly tension here, it was bad blood. 
 
Sheila looked at all of us, briefly, but clearly. He wanted to know what was around him, who would cause trouble. His hatred of us was so strong, I didn't know what would happen after the duel, if he won he would come straight for us.
 
Now I was glad the hunters were here. They would protect us.
 
As soon as Sheila landed he only focused on what lay ahead, on the spot that Guizan was going to land. he didn't have time to think about other things. Only on the duel itself.
 
Guizan's figure also grew, he wasn't wearing any expensive armour, in fact I recognized some of his items as the cheap ones from the store we spawned at. How could he compete with Sheila?
 
He didn't smile as well, he looked past us and with entirety focused on the hunters. They were moving about excited. Jason was sharpening his blade and licking his lips. Guizan knew who they were and what they were doing here, but he ignored them.
 
Davies turned to me, "Do you want some more milk Kei?"
 
"No thanks" I said.
 
He laughed and turned back to the scene. I saw Guizan looking at the hunters, and then at Sheila, and then at me. His eyes stayed on me a fraction longer and he smiled. There was an understanding between us.
 
When he landed though, he looked only at Sheila. 
 
Never in any game had I experienced such serious concentration for a short duel. Usually players mucked around without playing seriously.
 
"I'm surprised you actually came" Sheila said, "Your rank isn't high enough, but you still want to fight"
 
"This game wasn't made for cowards like you" Guizan said, "I'm going to defeat you, because I have to"
 
"You believe those programmers? Every single word they say?"
 
Guizan didn't reply, he brought out his weapon, which was one I didn't recognize, even though his armor was rudimentary, his weapon was unique.
 
He stared at Sheila, "I'm sorry" 
 
The battle began

---

### Chapter Twenty Three - Duel #2
 
"First time playing" Sheila said, "I'm noob" He laughed at his own joke.
 
Guizan's mouth moved quietly, he had a voice like a narrator, "I'm wasn't sure that was an option"
 
Sheila snarled and brought out a big shield. I was admiring it when he pounced forward with a look of agitation. Guizan reacted before I realized what happened, Sheila was lying on the ground, he had a long gash across his face, and one of his legs had a gash through it.
 
Casey looked at me, she tried to stop looking at the fight, but we both knew that we had to. It was part of our learning.
 
"It's horrible" I could barely hear her over the sound of the fighting, she frowned and looked back for a moment before flinching and avoiding it again.
 
"It's horrible" I said, "But it's the truth" I closed my arms around her. Sheila grunted and pulled himself off the ground, there was an extraordinary amount of willpower, he stood up and threw himself at Guizan. I couldn't tell how strong their blows were, but I could feel the wind off the swords breaking against my face, and Casey's hair blew up a few seconds after each swing.
 
Guizan had all sorts of techniques, he swung underneath and then cut over to attack Sheila. But Sheila had predicted and dodged it, with the time he gained he kicked Guizan in the stomach. Guizan flinched and coughed out some strange looking stuff.
 
Sheila grinned and laughed. "Why did you even bother fighting me? You know that I'm much higher level than you are, you don't stand a chance."
 
Guizan spat out some more of the stuff and brought out another weapon. "You're making me use a stronger weapon against you" he said, "Rankings don't matter, it is all skill"
 
"Your skill levels don't even match mine" he said, "Try and beat me properly, come on."
 
It was true, the rankings were an overall comparison of combat levels, since Sheila was higher up in rank, Guizan wouldn't stand a chance.
 
"You're wrong" Elsie said, "I realized this when I first started training, but the higher up in levels you go, the more your fights rely on strategy" she looked at me with sharp eyes, "Brute force is only important when you're lower down the food chain"
 
Compared to these players, we were much lower. We only leveled up an average of 1.5 levels a day, the top ranked players would level anywhere up to 4 or 5 levels a day. I didn't even dare check the highscore chart anymore, it only made me feel worse.
 
Guizan drove at Sheila, but the tables had turned, Sheila was much more serious now, he didn't joke around like before, he hardly even blinked, every bit of strength and mental power was focused on Guizan. When Guizan attacked him, he just twisted his sword to block it, when Guizan ran away he followed, there was no hesitation in his movements, every step was used efficiently, every swing of the sword was calculated to precision, even the angle that the sword moved at was thought of.
 
Sheila was no insignificant enemy. He was focused solely on cutting Guizan down.
 
They started exchanging blows extremely fast, and Sheila's sword began to build a soft red glow to it. I could see Guizan getting tired, he probably wouldn't be able to keep up for much longer.
 
Sheila kept building up speed, his long white air danced around him as his legs walked forward towards Guizan, pushing him back. 
 
Guizan roared and swung his blade at where Sheila hit, there was a loud clang as two metals smashed against each other. It was like a car crash, or two buildings colliding.
 
The dust blew away and I saw Sheila holding his sword against Guizan's, he looked down his sword with a snarl and tilted his neck, "You're no match for me you soggy mushroom"
 
Guizan was sweating all over, every inch of him was covered in thick wet sweat. There was no way he could still move comfortably. I thought that I would have bad cramp if I were him.
 
Sheila swung his sword again, with even more force, even the wind felt like it was cutting me. But Guizan defended it, he gripped his sword with both hands and yelled with all his might. Sheila's sword stopped right in front of him, barely scraping his arm.
"You do well for a ranked scrub, but you're stopping here, I'm not letting you anywhere near the top" He swung again, this time Guizan tried to block it but didn't have enough strength to stop it completely, it ripped through his armor and into his skin. He screamed out in agony,
 
"Stop it, stop it" Casey cried. "Don't hurt him" 
 
A part of me felt foolish to watch this. What were they fighting for, it seemed like everywhere people went there were those fighting. In this world even when you died you respawned, and you didn't age.
 
We were essentially fighting for the hours that we spent training our levels in this world, that was all.
 
And yet, that was the most important thing in this world.
 
Sheila's force kept growing, he didn't seem to have any limits, his strength far surpassed anything I could even imagine, he had so many different swings, and with different strengths. Guizan couldn't keep up, the difference in ranks was just too great.
 
"You're just another ant" Sheila said, He struck hard with the sword over him and slamming straight into Guizan underneath him, repeating each word with each strike. It was like he was hitting a nail into the ground. "YOU'RE     JUST       ANOTHER      ANT!"
 
Guizan couldn't keep up, he was getting lower and lower, his hp was almost gone and he had exhausted his strength. But he was still staring at Sheila with the same look in his eyes. 
 
Jason shook his head, "That's no good, we didn't want to face Sheila"
 
"It's our job, don't say that kind of thing" Davies put his hand on Jason's shoulder "Besides, we always knew who would win this duel"
 
"There's guys we beat down so many times who keep coming back and doing the same thing in the same place" Jason said, "And we get paid everytime to defeat them the same way at the same place"
 
"That's just the way it is" Davies said, "Just think of this as another one of those duels"
 
For the first time in the battle Guizan looked at me, it was in between Sheila's screams and cries of frustration. 
 
"Why won't you vanish" he said, "Why won't you disappear and respawn" Guizan's health was almost gone, there was a sliver remaining, but his eyes still held the same deathly gaze.
 
He still kept dodging Sheila's blows, but suddenly he stopped.
 
Sheila paused in midair. "What are you doing? Did you give up?" A smile slowly curled up his sides, "I finally got you, the great Guizan, I've finally defeated you"
 
He gave one more laugh and ran towards Guizan with a piercing scream.
 
Was this it? Was this the end of the duel?
 
Guizan dropped his sword, then lifted his arms towards Sheila.
 
Sheila looked confused for a second before resuming his attack. His white hair dropped for a second before picking up in the wind. 
 
Before he got close to Guizan he was blown up.
 
None of us really knew what had happened. A bright light had come out of Guizan's hands and went straight through Sheila, like a knife made of light.
 
Except, that it didn't even exist in the game.
Sheila fell to the ground, his hp had reached zero and gone negative. It still kept decreasing as he started to disintegrate.
 
Guizan didn't say a word, he looked to the ground, tired. His hp was still a sliver away from becoming nothing.
 
Sheila was dazed, "What did you do?" he said, "What was that?"
 
I looked to the hunters, but they looked surprised as well. "What was that?"
 
Richard was shocked. Elsie was as well. Only Casey was excited, "Guizan won, Guizan won" she said quietly.
 
"I'm going to come for you" Sheila said, "I'll never forget you Guizan, and I'll come for you as long as we're in this game"
 
There was no death, there was only respawning.
 
Guizan finally spoke, "I'm sorry Sheila, this was all to leave the game someday, a fight like this should never have happened"
 
A fight like this? What did Guizan mean?
 
Jason looked at Davies, Davies nodded and stood up. he called out to the boys with his eyes fixated on Guzian. Sheila had disintegrated, and there was a huge circle of earth where the fight had taken place and the snow had melted. And there was a pile of diamonds left behind where Sheila had been.
 
"I guess it's our turn now" Davies said. "It's an unexpected turn of events, difficult but not unmanageable"
 
"It's not the first time we've seen something like this happen" 
 
The hunters all brought out their weapons and walked towards Guizan, encircling him slowly.
 
"Sorry" Davies shrugged and stretched his neck around, "Just doing my job"
 
Guizan's health was still at a sliver. He took the diamonds and used them to level up slowly.

### Chapter Twenty Four - The After-Duel
 
"Where did you learn to fight like that?" Davies sharpened his sword, 
 
Guizan stood tall, "It's none of your business"
 
"You were cheating, that's what it was" Grim said, "Were you the cheater who destroyed this whole game for all of us?"
 
"I'm trying to get us out of this game" Guizan said, "Same as you. That's why I even did this duel in the first place, to get closer to the legendary item."
 
Jason indicated where the others should stand, he brought out a bow with a quiver full of arrows.
 
"Don't underestimate him" Jason said, "You guys saw that superhuman weapon he had just now"
 
Davies shook his head, "I don't understand this game at all, but I know a cheat when I see one"
 
"I'm not a cheat" Guizan said, "Please believe me, I'm just trying to do good here."
 
"Don't believe what he says guys" Jason said, "He's using it to get rid of us"
 
"Guizan, run" Casey cupped her hands around her mouth and called out. "There's too many of them, you have no health, and they're all experienced assassins."
 
Then she turned to the hunters, "Davies, please don't attack him, he's a good player"
 
"Don't call out to us" Davies said, "We're going to go for you next"
 
These hunters would do anything for a few levels.
 
"Run away" I also called to Guizan, I didn't want to see him go, he was one of the few players who I felt was really good.
 
Davies called out a number and the hunters began to prepare equipment. "Sorry" he said again, "I'm just doing my job"
 
He threw out a huge net, three others did the same. The nets flew over to Guizan and blew up into huge balloons. There was now way Guizan could dodge them. A huge plume of dust and snow spit into the air and we couldn't see anything.
 
"These nets are built for the highest level players" Davies said, "You're won't be the highest level player we capture, there's a lot more wild cards worse than you out there"
 
But when the dust cleared Guizan was nowhere to be seen.
 
Then suddenly Guizan appeared with a long whip, he swung it against one of the hunters who never said a word.
 
The hunter turned around and deflected it before Guizan realized, then the other four ran towards him with their own attacks.
 
Guizan saw he was in danger and jumped away. He was surrounded by all of them once more. "Run away" Casey shouted again, "Don't let them get you"
 
Guizan was sweating, his composure had disappeared, and his health was still almost gone. If any of the hunters landed one hit on him he would be gone.
 
"Attacking other players doesn't help anyone in here" Guizan said, "And that's all you hunters do"
 
"So?" Jason said, "What's your point?"
 
"Who hired all of you" Guizan said "That's what I really want to know"
 
I was surprised, Guizan was asking the exact same question that Elsie had been asking. How did Elsie know to ask that?
 
"Are those the last words of a dying man?" Davies said, "Next time make them nicer"
 
"I don't know about you" he said, "But I'm still alive"
 
The hunters jumped on him again, but Guizan dodged their attacks, He slid his sword out and nicked a few of them on the side. Somehow none of them could land any blows on him.
 
"All together" Davies said, "Don't give him any space to breathe" 
 
Guizan countered most of the attacks, then he dodged the rest with minimal movement.
 
"You're strong" Grim said, "But our total level is more than five hundred, no player is that strong, no player can beat us."
 
"I have something to live for" Guizan said, "There's something that needs to be done here, I'm the only one who knows about it, I can't die here."
 
The Guizan opened up his palms, they started to glow a bright yellow again.
 
"He's doing it again" Jason yelled, "Get him quick" He raised his bow and fired three quick shots at Guizan.
 
But none of the arrows reached him, there was an explosion all around him of the same bright light. It was there instantly and then it was gone.
 
I held my breath in, everything was gone. The snow had disappeared in a one hundred meter radius and the air was clear, the hunters were all collapsed on the ground and the first of them started disintegrating.
 
"What just happened" Spaz said, "I'm a combat analyst and I've never seen anything like this before"
 
"This game is still new, we don't know what's in it" Karl said.
 
Suze gripped Eilish's arm. "Is he a player?" she said, "Or is he a hacker? No player is so strong"
 
Guizan wasn't calm, he looked sad. "I'm sorry" he said, "I'm really sorry about all of this" He went down and sat on one of the rocks, all around him was the spraying dust of the hunters disintegrating. He looked around at them with a disappointed expression on his face.
 
"Where did you learn that skill?" One of the hunters said, "Where"
 
"I'm sorry" Jason said, "Can you revive me, please, I won't be a hunter"
 
Grim wailed under his breath, "I'm going to get you Guizan, I'm going to restart and come straight back for you, that's all I want to do in this game"
 
Guizan sighed, "Everywhere I go, every battle I have, there's always more enemies that I make. Everyday more and more players follow my footsteps to come after me."
 
He was talking to himself, as the hunters yelled at him he just continued talking. He hadn't lost any of his health, and a calmness and regret had overtaken him.
 
"With every battle, I get the brunt of the hatred and revenge that the players I beat have. Now I will also be burdened with the great weights that Sheila pulled.
 
He sighed. There was no fear in his voice, only fatigue. A great fatigue and exhaustion, a sigh to encompass the whole world.
 
He was the most tired man I ever knew.
 
Davies had been silent the whole time, now as the last of him was disappearing he started to call out. "I never hated you Guizan, I never loved you either, but I never disliked you. I respected you, and if it's to you, then I don't mind losing."
 
Guizan was still talking to himself, "One day I will let myself be defeated, and then another one can bear a great burden..."
 
Davies turned to us. "I was just joking Casey" he said, "I was never going to go attack you guys anyway, I wouldn't have touched you, you guys are good players, a good team. 
 
"Stop" Casey said. "Stop it Davies"
 
"Don't let any hunters like us get to you. We're no good, not good men"
 
Casey burst into tears. I wasn't sure if it was because of Guizan, or the hunters, maybe a bit of both, but I also felt sad too. This duel was nothing good, there were no deaths, only respawns.
 
But that just made light of the duel.
 
Davies disappeared and the dust slowly cleared, now it was only Guizan sitting on the rock in front of us. He stood up and collected all of the diamonds then walked over to us.
 
"I'm glad to see you're all alive" He nodded at me. "You're doing well, I'm glad to see you doing the right thing."
 
He had only got to such a high level because he was collecting all of the diamonds from other players.
 
"We're all such a low level" I said. "You've leveled up more than we have, and we've been training the whole time"
 
"It's because we don't attack other players" Elsie looked at me. Here we go, Elsie was going to argue about it again. She was convinced that she was right, and I was as well.
 
"No, you're doing the right thing" Guizan said, "Levels are not the most important" 
 
"Then is it strategy?" Elsie said.
 
"No" Guizan said. "There's something else"
 
"What is it?"
 
Guizan laughed, "Someday you will know"
 
He was standing in front of us laughing with no health at all left. How could he remain so relaxed? Anyone could attack him just once and he would lose all of his hard earned levels. Why was he talking about these things that we would one day know about.
 
"How can you say that levels aren't the most important and then go around and attack other players?" Elsie said.
 
"Someday you will know" Guizan stood back, preparing to leave.
 
"Is that all you can say?"
 
"What was that thing you did with your hands, with the bright air destroying everything?" Richard said, "How did you do that?"
 
Guizan grinned, "You liked it? It was pretty amazing right?"
 
"It was brutal" Suze said, "That's all it was, I don't know how you did it, but don't do it again" 
 
Linda whispered to Suze, "Like that's gonna happen, he's a man, they're obsessed with these power plays"
 
"How did you do it Guizan? Tell me" Richard ran forward, "If you tell us, then we can help you take down the other players"
 
"It's not for everyone" Guizan said, he looked at me and smiled. "This game is foolish" Richard reached him, but when he tried to grab he only felt thin air.
 
"He's gone" Richard said. Guizan had literally disappeared into thin air, the same way all of the others had.
 
I couldn't believe it. I felt so small compared to him, not even worthy of being an ant.
 
"That's a man with no sense of pride" Elsie said.
 
I nodded.
 
"He's pathetic" Elsie shook her head and laughed, "I can't believe that someone like him beat those hunters, he doesn't deserve to win" She looked at us, "I'm sorry, I know you guys like him, I just can't bear his weakness. He's a coward complaining about everything."
 
"I feel so small in comparison to him" Richard said.
 
I felt exactly the same way, but I couldn't say it. If I did, then it would make our journey seem even more meaningless.
 
Guizan was so much stronger than any of us expected. Yet he was so much less excited about it.
 
---

### Chapter Twenty Five - Halfway To Somewhere
 
The others joined us. Spaz, Eilish, Karl, Suze, and Linda.
 
"We came to say farewell" Suze said.
 
After witnessing the duel together, we all opened up and felt like we knew each other better. We all shook hands and wished each other all the best from here.
 
"Be careful, don't get caught by hunters" Suze said.
 
"Of course, and you guys too" I said.
 
"Davies might make another team and come and get you, so be careful" Some of the guys laughed, but I couldn't it was not something to laugh about, they had just disappeared from here.
 
The snow had started to fall again, so we decided to take a break on the summit before moving on.
 
"You know what I was thinking?" Linda said. Linda didn't talk much, so we all listened in.
 
"I was just thinking, that it feels like we're halfway through our journey" she said.
 
Casey giggled, "You know what, I was just thinking the same thing"
 
"No way" Eilish said, "Me too, after that duel it just felt like we were going halfway to somewhere"
 
"What journey?" I said, "Halfway through what journey Linda?"
 
"Just this whole life we're living here" she said. "It feels like a halfway point, whatever is going to come is going to be the same length as what we've just come through."
 
I had never thought of it like that before, that our progress in this game was a life, life had always been something completely different to what was happening here.
 
"It's weird" Elsie said, "We all feel the same way after that duel, like something big has happened and something's about to change."
 
Suze said, "Maybe it's programmed into our minds like a big thing that changes everyone's thinking or something" We all burst into laughter
 
"In this game, anything is possible" Karl said.
 
"I know right?" Casey said, "What was with Guizan's super Dragon Ball spells just now, did the programmers copy from every other place?"
 
"If I write a review of this game" Suze said, "I'm going to write plagiarism in the 'looking for improvements' section" 
 
"We have to get out of here first if you want to write a review" Spaz said. everyone laughed again, leaving the game had become a laughing matter.
 
"And then we're going to be going through the pearly gates when we finish" Linda said "A saint will be standing around to let us through"
 
"No, it will be Guizan and Sheila there" Elsie said, "Guizan will let Kei through and say something like 'You did a good job there' like the way he's obsessed with Kei. Sheila will be confused whether he's a guy or girl"
 
"Oh my gosh" Suze said, "Did you think that too? I wasn't sure until he started speaking, I was like...why is a girl speaking in a man's voice?"
 
Everyone burst out laughing again. The tension had died off and we were all enjoying the mood. Laughter only came by once in a while, so it was grabbed whenever it was found and it slowly trickled out of our hands. There were a lot of people laughing in the world at one time, and they always looked to tohers as the ones who were laughing.
 
Linda came up with a good suggestion, but everyone felt it anyway. "Let's have a peaceful moment" she said, "Let's have a peaceful moment dedicated to this point in time, we've all come so far, in a place we never knew about, and we're all trying to find our way back home, literally"
 
"Okay" we agreed and sat around for a while. We all sat in a circle in the snow, it wasn't cold, it was just comfortable.
 
"It's so comfortable" Karl said.
 
"As comfortable as a steamy hot bath on a cold winters day" said Spaz.
 
"Whooah" Richard said, "That was a good one" There are a lot of people laughing in the world right now, those ones who are laughing make the other ones laugh, and it keeps on going around in a circle
 
When it was finally time to say farewells, we set off in opposite directions. With the Super Earls going one way, and us, the Sparkling Dragons heading in the other direction.
 
"Where are you going?" Richard asked Linda. It was from one navigator to another. He called out as the sun was setting, Linda probably could only see his shadow, but she knew what he was saying.
 
And she knew how to answer.
 
"I don't know" Linda said, "Those mountains look beautiful and promising, how about you guys?"
 
"We're going to the mountains over there" Richard pointed in the direction we were heading, "They look beautiful and promising as well"
 
"Well, I think we will meet again" Linda said. "Let's be promising and beautiful together"
 
"Yeah" we all waved goodbye into the last of the sunlight.
 
When we started walking we were still joking from the wear off, the mood was promising.
 
"That was great wasn't it?" Richard said,
 
"Yeah" Only at a time like this could we pull of talking about something so plain.
 
Sometime, halfway from now, things would be finishing. I had that feeling, and that kept me moving forward. If we were halfway, it meant that we were halfway from somewhere.
 
"Let's do something" I said.
 
Richard, Elsie and Casey looked at me.
 
"What are you saying?" Casey said, "Do you know what you're saying?" She leaned sideways and talked, "I always know what I'm saying"
 
"Oh, you two are disgusting" Elsie grinned, "Tell me everything"
 
We burst out laughing.
 
"What I wanted to do was, I thought we should write our names here in the sand"
 
"Right here?" Casey said, "Why?"
 
"That's a great idea" Richard found a stick lying nearby. "People will remember us forever"
 
"Not just that" I said, "We can figure out what our names really are"
 
"You're weird today" Casey said. She took the stick out of Richard's hand and wrote her name in the sand anyway. Then she gave it to Elsie who did the same.
 
I was the last one to write it, I wrote my real name, the one I always used to use.
 
"Nagamoto Keisuke"
 
It was a good day today.
 
Then in December something happened, it snowed beautifully. 
 
None of us knew that the game had been programmed for it.

### Chapter Twenty Six - "I'm gonna go now"
 
"It's a big story" Casey said, "A never ending story" She was talking about Suze, apparently they had a long chat the night before and Casey was recounting the parts of the story to us, well the parts of the story that were okay to tell in mixed company.
 
"Suze lived in an apartment, and she didn't want to keep spending money, so she just started gaming. She said she lost three kg's in two weeks"
 
"No way" Elsie said. "That much?"
 
"That wasn't it though" Suze said, "She kept gaining weight until she found this game, now she doesn't know her real weight."
 
"That sounds like Suze" Elsie said, "She seems a bit carefree like that, oh not in a bad way Casey, she just seems really relaxed." 
 
I didn't really understand it but I was glad to hear them talking. The farewells with the Super Earls had gotten long, even though it had only been three days, we knew each other really well.
 
But we were wise enough not to exchange email addresses or contacts in the real world. I remembered how I had done so when the game first started, there were so many names in my contact list that I didn't even know.
 
"Richard" I said, "Where are we going"
 
He was walking and looking through the map. "Do you remember what Spaz told us?" he said.
 
"Nope" I shook my head and slowed down to walk beside him and look through the map with him. 
 
"Oh" Richard looked up at me, "You weren't there when we had that conversation, he was telling us about the Programmer's meeting coming up."
 
"What is that?" I said, "What programmers?" I hadn't heard anything about that.
 
"The guys who designed the game" Elsie said, "Who else"
 
"Of course I knew that" I said, "I was just wondering what they were going to be talking about"
 
Elsie grunted, "Yeah whatever"
 
"They're talking about the eternal problem, Kei" Casey said, "That's what they're calling this game"
 
Richard smiled, "The eternal problem huh,  they must be fun at parties."
 
"It's not much to do with that" Elsie said, "It's because they don't know what to call it." She caught up with us and put her hand on Richard's shoulder. He immediately blushed and looked away.
 
"How far are we from the meeting spot?" she said. 
 
Richard had trouble keeping calm, I felt sorry for the poor guy. "It's at Cradnean's Rock" He pointed at the map, and then showed us where we were. "We're about one day from it"
 
"Guizan's probably already there" Elsie said, "He can just fly there"
 
"He's a much higher level than us" I said. Elsie glanced at me, I could tell she was upset about something again. It was time to get this over with, I was sick of having bad blood between us.
 
"I'm not much of a fighter" I said, "And I'm not much of a gamer so I'm not very good at this game, but I still don't want to attack other players" Elsie looked at me, her eyes widened, maybe she was impressed at how I was speaking so directly, I didn't stop, "I'm sorry if that frustrates you, if you want to attack other players, then go ahead and do so" I took a deep breath, it wasn't the first time I had thought about this, but my decision was final. "But I can't follow along with you guys" 
 
Casey was stunned, "Kei, that was so cool, the way you just confessed all of that. I really admire you right now."
 
"Well you don't need to stop" I said. "I'm just speaking what I'm thinking"
 
Elsie smiled, "You're so weird Kei." She turned to Casey, "Casey you were asking about the days before we got there, and it was true, but now she can finally figure it out. Because they can sense how long things have progressed for.
 
Elsie showed us the high-scores, Guizan had moved up one rank, the name Sheila had disappeared off the list. He had probably respawned, but I could only imagine what he was thinking.
 
"You can never kill someone, they will always come back to avenge themselves. So it is only buying time." Elsie said "There is no death in this game, that's why it's a game"
 
"No" Casey said, "You can never kill someone" That was it, she stopped speaking.
 
And it was true. I was touched, she said some really good things.
 
Elsie smiled, "You guys are so cute, the way you're always agreeing with each other. But I think this game is boring" She looked at me, "There's no death, there's no finish, and everything can be taken back"
 
"Don't get philosophical so early in the morning" I said. "We just have to finish the game right?"
"Right" Elsie said, "You get it, it's just a game. This whole life is a game." Elsie kept speaking, as if she was finally spitting out what had been trapped inside her. It was a rare moment of insight into who she was. "We're all friends only because of where we are right now" She said, "If I wasn't in this game, then I wouldn't know you at all, I would have completely different friends."
 
Casey frowned, "Don't say that Elsie, we're good friends" 
 
Richard did a deep sigh. "When we leave this game, we might not have anything to talk about" he said. "I don't want that to happen."
 
"It's okay" Elsie said, "That's just the way life is, you move on"
 
"No, I want to know you guys forever" Casey said. We all burst out laughing, the way she said it was hilarious.
 
But once we stopped laughing we could think about it.
 
"I really want to know you guys forever" Casey said it more quietly this time. But the message was clear.
 
Forever was a long time.
 
Elsie said, "What if Guizan was an enemy, wouldn't that be scary?"
 
"Of course" Casey said, "But he's not an enemy, he's with us"
 
"Maybe" Elsie said, "But do you think these top players are our enemies?"
 
"What made you think of that anyway?" Casey said, "I never would have thought of that"
 
Elsie smiled, "That's because you're Casey, and I'm Elsie, we're both girls but we're not the same"
 
Casey laughed, "You're so weird Elsie, of course we're girls." Casey twiddled her hair "But I like you, you know"
 
Elsie was strangely talkative today, she was talking about her thoughts a lot, usually she just pointed out strategies of attacks, or how to train effectively. But today it seemed different, she was a lot warmer.
 
"Did you know that the top ranked players defeat over four players every day?" She said, "The programmers would all know that, they have some huge thing they use to keep score."
 
"That's why we're going there right?" I said, "Because they will have some solutions to our questions" I had so many questions since the game started, they had slowly been building up as we saw new things happen around us. But of course, the biggest one was the eternal question.
 
"So let's go see the programmers" she said, 
 
"That's what we're doing" Richard said, "We discussed it before we left right?"
 
Elsie was holding her hips. "You sound stressed, don't sound stressed, enjoy it, you time here, and everything we're doing"
 
"She's so stressed" Casey told me, "She needs to relax"
 
Elsie started telling a story, one we knew all to well. "I checked the High Scores, the top fifty players in the world were listed and their stats were shown. Then in five minutes sixty players had been killed. As soon as the message appeared everyone became desperate."
 
Elsie was leading us, she sat in one of the rocks shaped like a seat, we were beginning to become really good at finding these. We kind of fluttered down around her.
 
"From the onset all of the players were collecting diamonds, everyone was getting desperate to leave." she said, "Even I was a bit upset"
 
"You were upset?" Casey said, "I didn't see that in you at all"
 
Elsie didn't hear her, she didn't give any indication of stopping, she kept speaking like a jet plane flying above us, consuming everything. She was saying things I never heard of, somehow she was captivating, and if she was captivating to me, then Richard was obsessed. He couldn't take his eyes off her. It was like Elsie was engaged in a flourishing verbal dance.
 
"I saw a very rare creature...the one time when I didn't take a camera, I was really upset, and then I never saw it again. Can you believe it? All of the times I went there to train, then it never reappeared again."
 
She was talking about training with us, but I had never known this side of Elsie, the Elsie who was enthusiastic about plants, wildlife, creatures, and this world. 
 
"What if this had all been designed in the first place? Why else would there be no log out?" Richard said. "What do you think Elsie?"
 
Elsie stopped speaking, she halted like an insect hitting the front screen of a 60 seat bus. She stared at Richard, "Didn't you know?" she said, "Didn't you know the key in this game is to specialize?"
 
She was saying what Spaz had told me. 
 
"We all have to make a huge team and specialize" she said, "You do this, I do this, and he does this" she pointed to us, she didn't know us, we were just pawns to her monologue. "Then we make a big team made up of different players, then we'll be the strongest that a team can be."
 
How did she know all of this? Where did her knowledge come from, Elsie had been living the same life as us? So why was she so adamant about her beliefs?
 
"When we first started" she said, "Some of the players were already level 2 with a huge advantage. But then chaos broke out, the players started rushing about, buying items and trying to level up. Elsie, Richard, Casey and I all agreed to level up together as a group, that way it would be easier amongst all of the competition."
 
She was describing the start of the game again, she had probably been thinking about it a lot, and was re telling it. But it wasn't exactly what had happened, and she was retelling it from my point of view...
 
"But before we knew it, players were attacking each other. I grabbed Casey's hand and shouted to the others to follow, we wouldn't survive if we stayed here. Then Richard came along with us, and then... 
 
I couldn't bear to listen, where was this story coming from, it wasn't what really happened.
 
Elsie looked at me, "And then Elsie came along as well."
 
"Then we ran, and ran"
 
I couldn't believe that Elsie had thought about all of this, it was gruesome and nasty. Why was she talking about herself in the third person, why was she looking at me?"
 
Elsie picked up again, "We were all travelling through the big map, even Kei didn't know how big it was, then Elsie started to get stronger and he became more confident that they would find its limits. Elsie was leveling up really fast, he couldn't keep up with her talent."
 
I sat on the ground and leaned back, it was like she was telling us our story, Casey held Richard's hand and they both watched Elsie as she talked.
 
"We lost connection with the outside world as soon as they agreed to try and revert everything back to normal and how it used to be. We might start needing everyone's cooperation." She was speculating beyond anythign we knew.
 
"We found out that when you get to level 10, you have the choice of leaving the game, or of restarting even stronger." Now she was saying what had been on my mind, had she also been thinking about it? I looked at her as she spoke, looked at her jaw move and her hair swing back and forth as she tilted her head looking at each of us.
 
Because of the leveling, now we're nomads, changing careers all the time. The diamonds, they found that each player has them, and "these are the key to winning the game", not the levels. Because diamonds manipulate levels. So I said they're the most important, and Elsie agreed with me."
 
But the top player, he chose to steal all of the diamonds so that other players can't play."
 
Was that really what the top player did? "How do you know?"
 
"I'm just guessing" she said, "It has to be that way, that's the only way he could have leveled up so fast. I used to think that if there were only a limited number of diamonds, then this game would be completely different, then only about one third of players would be able to leave because there aren't diamonds for everyone. Then you would be taking diamonds from the pessimistic sellers and giving them to the optimistic buyers"
 
She turned to Casey, "You would love that right? Because women love communication and honesty above everything else. Oh, and you have to have tact when you say things to a woman"
 
"I'm not sure about the high level players, but they probably have girlfriends already..."
 
Suddenly before I knew it the air was quiet. Elsie had stopped speaking, mid sentence. Her eyes were looking at the sky, as if diligently gathering memories in the air together, memories of something that had never taken place. 
 
The silence was deafening.
 
No one dared speak, it felt like nothing could compare or match what Elsie had been saying. She had been talking for a long time and now the sun had sunk and I could barely see Casey and Richard sitting on the other side.
 
"Sorry Elsie finally said. "I talked for too long didn't I?"
 
"No" Casey said, "I enjoyed that, I haven't heard something that sincere in a long time" I saw her hand move, she stood up and stretched her legs.
 
"Do you guys know of a super strong enemy who isn't in the High Score boards?" Elsie said.
 
What? Was there another player who was extremely strong? This game seemed to be full of secrets that I didn't know about.
 
"Who?" Richard said.
 
"Me" Elsie says, then she burst out laughing, "Just joking, I won't be your enemy, I love you guys"
 
I was still staring, she was in a completely different world, not with us. "You guys are so awesome" she said, "You're all so respectful of everyone, this game's come a long way, but we're all together"
 
"Oh, I'm so glad to be in a team with you" Casey said, "I feel exactly the same way"
 
Richard looked at me, then turned to Elsie, "I'm glad you and Kei could make up, it's really important for our team. You've got a really good sense of combat, and sensitivity that I don't see often, I really respect that of you."
"Same" Elsie said, "I like you too, and I'm going to miss you"
 
"Huh?" Casey said. She looked at me. Richard also stared blankly.
 
"What do you mean?" I said, was she joking again?
 
"I'm leaving you guys" Elsie said. "I have to do some things" She was still smiling.
 
"You're joking right?" Richard said.
 
"I'll see you guys whenever we do" she said, "Maybe in the real world, this game's pretty big"
 
"It's not funny" I said, "Don't say stuff like that"
 
Elsie shook her head, there was no mistake, I saw tears in her eyes. "I'm not joking, I was talking a lot earlier, I'm sorry, but I've been thinking about it for a long time already, and I have to do this"
 
Richard put his hands on her shoulders, "Where are you going? How come you didn't tell us about this." He looked at me, as if asking me to convince her as well. "You can't leave" he said. "We're a team, remember?"
 
"We're the Sparkling Dragons" Elsie said, "I know" She tried to smile, but now more tears were flowing down her cheeks. The warm liquid sparkled in the red sunset and stuck her hair together in smooth slim strands.
 
"Then you can't leave" Casey said, "You really can't, now that you and Kei have made up we're going to be so good"
 
"If it's because of me and about attacking other players..." I said, "It's not important, but you should stay with us. We're the sparkling dragons together, not one of us can be missing."
 
"It was a promise, you said we would level up together"
 
"I'm sorry" Elsie said, "I have to break my promise, I don't want to, but I have to."
 
"Who's making you do this?" Richard said, "I'll go and..."
 
Elsie was shaking her head with her hair shaking around her, the tips were tremoring along with her jaw and lips, she was a mess of tears, I wanted to do something to help her but I didn't know how.
 
Casey kneeled down and wrapped her arm around Elsie, "What's wrong Els" she said, "What's made you so sad?"
 
Elsie shook her head, "Nothing, don't mind me, please, I don't want to cause you any trouble, but I really have to go."
 
"But you're with us, why do you have to go?" Casey said.
 
Elsie pulled Casey's hand and took it off her shoulder. "Sorry, I can't, if you hug me then I won't be able to leave, I'm sorry" She pushed herself off the ground and stood up. She stared straight at me.
 
"I'm sorry" she looked into my eyes. I forced myself to stare back, she was so much stronger than I was, what would we do without her.
 
"I want to leave this game too" Elsie said, "But up until now we've been doing it one way, I want to do it my own way now"
 
"I'll come with you" Richard said.
 
Elsie looked at Richard, then at me. "No" she said. Richard stood by for an explanation, but she didn't have one.
 
"You three work well together" she said, "I don't, so I'm going to go now. Kei needs you, and you need him"
 
"No" Casey said, "We really enjoy your company here as well, if it's because of us."
 
"Don't go" I said, "You've taught all of us much"
 
"It's not to do with you Casey" Elsie said, "Nothing to do with you guys"
 
"If it's not about us" I said, "Then there's no reason to leave"
 
Elsie turned to me and walked with her heels like a catwalk. "You still don't understand?" she said, "It's all to do with you"
 
"Me?" I said.
 
"You don't know now" she said, "But you will soon"
 
"What do you mean? What did I do?" 
 
Never mind. Elsie rolled her eyes and wiped the last of her tears. 
 
"I'm gonna go now" She walked off into the sunset, Richard ran after her to discuss some things. Then Casey looked at me, then at her, then ran along as well.
 
I was left to stand here alone.

### Chapter Twenty Seven
 
"She left" Richard came back with a grin on his face, "Nothing Casey or I said could convince her, she was adamant"
 
"Why?" Casey looked at me, "I don't understand, who would be so strong willed about leaving their friends?"
 
They were both looking at me, I felt that they were talking to me to resolve my guilt. For some reason they had both come back to me and not followed Elsie along. I felt really bad, was it my fault that Elsie left? Should I have done something else?
 
"Are you two okay with not following her?" My voice sounded a lot more quiet than I hoped
 
"Yeah we're fine" Richard answered immediately, "She wanted to go off alone anyway"
 
I didn't know, but to me she looked a bit lonely, or sad when she was leaving.
 
"Now that she's gone" Casey said, "Kei, what did you think of Elsie?"
 
I looked at her, "Serious? She left only a few hours ago."
 
"Yeah" Richard nodded, "I want to know too." He made his way towards me and stood next to Casey, both of them were looking at me weirdly.
 
"Does she like me?" I said.
 
"What?" Casey said, "You think it's because she has a crush on you? Like we're in High School with boyfriends and girlfriends? Is that what you think"
 
I knew it was a mistake the moment it came out of my mouth but it had been on my mind a lot recently, "Never mind" I said,
 
"No" Casey said. 
 
"No what? You won't answer, or is it an inappropriate question?"
 
"No, she didn't like you?" Casey said. "Were you asking that for real?" 
 
Richard looked at me and shook his head, "What were you thinking? Is that why you were treating her bad?"
 
"I didn't treat her bad, is that what she said? Whenever you two were talking I always knew it was something" 
 
"She's a woman, you can't go around talking to her like that" Richard said. 
 
"You don't even notice those people around you" Casey said, "Why did you think she liked you?"
 
"Well what do you think?" I directed the question to Casey this time.
 
"I just know" she said, "I don't need to think it"
 
I snorted, well that was a great answer. Casey grinned, "Is that good enough for you? There's things a woman knows"
 
"There we go" Richard said "So you were also supposed to be close to Elsie?"
 
"No" Casey shook her head. 
 
We all stood around, there was a tension that had surfaced among us, something that had not just come from nowhere. Was it Elsie leaving or Elsie coming, what had happened?
 
I took in the clouds, the brown sandy mountains that jagged the line of the horizon into a seismic reading. All of the newly wed couples would travel to this kind of place to experience it together, yet we were here arguing. It felt like a big waste, wasn't there a lot more better to be done?
 
Before we knew it, I couldn't speak to Richard normally, and Elsie as well. Maybe it was my fault, but Elsie was the more sensitive one and had to leave.
 
I just didn't know.
 
Richard broke the silence we had with a smile. "Come on guys, we're the sparkling dragons, remember? What happened to us?" He looked at Casey, she sat with her shoulders sagged and her face in her palms. I just watched the both of them with big eyes.
 
"Huh Casey? We're a team, Kei, you as well. What are we doing with this kind of attitude towards each other?"
 
"Do you want to break off as well?" Casey said it then slowly turned her gaze up to Richard, "Do you want to go off as well?" She looked at me, "Then it will only be us two..."
 
"Don't be ridiculous" Richard said. "We're the Sparkling Dragons right?" He offered his hand out to Casey, she took it and he pulled her up. "Come on, we're getting out of here"
 
"Yeah" Casey looked to me.
 
"Let's go Kei" Richard said, he took a step to the left in stood in between the both of us. "Okay Casey, now you need to decide on where we should go"
 
"Again?" Casey said, "I always do that"
 
"Don't you love it though?"
 
"Yeah" she smiled, "I will" She started spinning around with her eyes closed until she stopped and was pointing to one place. "Over there!" she said.
 
"Wait!" I said. They both looked to me.
 
"Aren't we heading towards the jagged mountains over there?" We had the programmer's meeting to get to.
 
"Oh that's right" Casey said, "I almost forgot, Kei's right"
 
"Yeah true" Richard said, "I was enjoying this too much, let's go that way then"
 
So we started to head off towards the Programmer's meeting, Richard was the navigator and decided it wouldn't take very long, we would be there by tomorrow.
 
The Sparkling Dragons had set out again and moods were high. But I had the slight hint of a feeling, I wasn't sure if it was just me, but had Richard forgotten about Elsie? He was clinging to Casey and talking to her a lot more than any time we had been through yet. 
 
A small and narrow part of me felt a flush. But I stepped on it and smothered it before it bloomed.
 
Everything was good.
 
---

### Chapter Twenty Eight
 
We sat around and set up a little light. Richard brought out some food from his inventory and Casey helped him cook it. We had made good progress today and Richard predicted that we would be there a few hours after starting tomorrow.
 
As soon as Casey left to get some mushrooms, the atmosphere changed. Richard and I fell silent and did our jobs.
 
"Don't worry man" he peeled a potato with his sword. "In case you were thinking about it, it's not your fault she left"
 
"How do you feel about it?" I said. "It must have been very big"
 
The potato had stopped spinning, Richard's hands let it go and it fell on the ground. He had his sword carefully balanced between his feet. "It's not easy" he said. "She's a special person to me now"
 
"If she's so special to you?" I said, "Then why didn't you follow her"
 
"This might sound weird" His eyes moved up to look into mine, it was dark so I couldn't see into them, I saw a brief reflection of myself in them, with the inside a deep black shadow that moved back and forth with the breathing of the fire in the air.
 
"This might sound weird" Richard said, "But if I followed her, then I was afraid that she might not be as much of a special person to me anymore" He sighed and picked the potato back up, "Do you understand?"
 
"I do" I nodded. 
 
Richard glanced at me. "You do don't you, I have a feeling you know exactly what I'm talking about"
 
"Maybe" I said.
 
"You do, you're cheeky mate, cheeky" He poked me in the ribs. "I should have said I like you, that's why I stayed"
 
"How about Casey?" I said. 
 
"You mean why she stayed?" He threw the naked potato into a bucket and picked up a dirty one lying on the ground. "Isn't it obvious?" Richard said. "She likes you" Then Richard looked up at me again, giving me the vision of my hollow self, the fire was bigger now, as if it had been feeding on the potatoes, the black area was bigger, only an outline of myself was there. 
 
"Kei, you're more important than you think you are" Richard said, tossing another potato into the bucket. "That's why Casey and I followed you. And I hate to say it, but that's why Elsie didn't follow you"
 
"So don't ask me again about this okay?" he said. "It's not good"
 
I nodded. "It's only been one day since Elsie left" I said, "I just didn't understand it, and was upset at myself for not knowing it earlier. It's true we had some disagreements, but we didn't dislike each other, she helped me to grow an incredible amount. I didn't know how yet, but something was missing after she left. That meant that she was important right?"
 
"Don't worry, I have the same fears sometimes" Richard said, "We all do, Elsie, and even Casey does too, it's just that...I don't know, don't stress about it." He tossed another potato into the pile. Right before me the pile was growing into a tower, since when had it become such a substantial amount. "I was wondering what Elsie was doing, if she was okay, and if she made any friends? Did she join a new team? What is her goal?"
 
"I don't know" I said, "But this world is small, we will see her one day, and then we can ask her ourselves"
 
"You're right" Richard said, "No one can die here anyway" He grinned. "It's funny isn't it?"
 
"What are you guys talking about, with such quiet voices" Casey came over with a basket of mushrooms. 
 
"Are those mushrooms edible?" Richard said.
 
"Yes" Casey said, she looked at me, "I put all the poisonous ones in Kei's pile"
 
"What?" I was shocked.
 
They both burst out laughing, "That reaction was great" Richard said, Casey was also smiling.
 
It seemed that things were back to normal again. The sun rose the next morning and Richard briefed us over what was going to happen. The three of us sat in a circle.
 
"We're going to be at a town to buy some equipment, and then move through it to the Programmer's meeting, which is 'here' " He pointed to a dot on the map. "My guess is that this is the middle of the map so that everyone can get to it easily, that's why it's set here. It's close to the town so we can kind of check out the environment before we get too close."
 
It sounded like a great plan, I was impressed, after meeting The Super Earls, and especially Spaz, Richard seemed to have gotten some confidence in navigating, and some knowledge of his role, he was of a great help.
 
But we all knew what he meant when he said check out the environment. With Elsie gone, our combat potential had dropped significantly. I was our main source. Casey had specialized in cooking and extraneous skills, and Richard was on navigation and organization. At the Programmer's meeting the highest players were bound to be there, as well as extremely knowledgeable players who knew the ropes to the game.
 
We reached the town pretty quickly and scouted around the store. There were a few items on sale. I bought a few arrows, and met up with the others. I used up all of my leftover diamonds for leveling before we went further. After checking my stats, I was level seventy, getting up to the mid range. But I wasn't sure what mid range was anymore, the last players we met were at the table mountain where the duel had taken place.
 
"I heard that there's one of the Programmer's here" Casey said. "He also came from where we started the game."
 
 "The farmyard?" Richard said, "That's what they were calling it when we left right?" 
 
"Apparently he lives here now, maybe we can go visit him and learn some things"
 
"If we're so close, he will have gone to the Programmer's meeting already" I said, "That's why he lives so close right?"
 
"You're right" Casey said, "But do you think they will let us in" She stopped in her tracks, "We're not Programmer's we're just regular players, and surely there will be so many other players like us who will gather here; maybe The Super Earls. We're nothing special to them, they might not let us in." 
 
"It's true" a voice said behind us. It was a man with his hands crossed and a grin. "This town is where all the Programmer's gather before they go into the meeting"
 
He was a level 5 player. Really low, I was impressed, I hadn't met anyone so low in a long time. He limped towards us with a big stick of lancewood as a leg.
 
"Are you a programmer?" Richard said. This player's name was Heron - rank level 5. But he stood with a confidence that said he was a much higher level.
 
"No, I've specialized in building, gets me a lot of diamonds, and doesn't get me respawning either" he said. "I just see a stream of you fellows coming along wanting to get into The Pad." He stretched out his wooden leg and leaned down to screw it tighter. "Argh, this thing keeps coming loose"
 
So the programmer's meeting was held at a place called The Pad? 
 
"And do you think we can get in?" Casey said. 
 
"Maybe" he said. "But not everyone can, you need my help" Heron stood with his legs apart and a confident grin. "You need steel arrows." He pointed at me. "You're a ranger right? You want stronger arrows?" His grey pants bickered like tiny waves in the air. His hair was whitening at the sides, but his fingers were calm.
 
"What do you mean?" I said. 
 
"I can make them for you" he looked around, "If you want"
 
"You can make arrows?" I thought that arrows could only be bought.
 
"Engineering is very popular and there are all sorts of discoveries being made recently, the latest one is a plane, and I'm the only one who can make it." As he said it he reached down to screw his leg tighter again.
 
"How do you know?" Casey said. "That you're the only one who can make it"
 
"Because I know" I noticed that his leg was rusty on the edges, the screw was coming undone because of it.  Was he really a top engineer? He looked like one of the guys from the farmyard who had escaped. Why was there a man with a wooden leg here? What kind of circumstances led to him being in this village with such a leg. And I was shocked, I didn't think it was possible that someone wouldn't have four limbs in this game. He could just respawn.
 
Maybe I was thinking too far into it.
 
"I like this, it's a cosmetic device" he said, twisting the screw back on again, and then banging it in frustration. "But sometimes it just gets on my nerves."
 
It was a cosmetic...? Casey and I looked at each other. Only Richard looked transfixed. 
 
"That's so cool" Richard said, how do you get one of those.
 
"You're not getting one!" said Casey and stormed off.
 
...
 
"Anyway" Heron said. "It doesn't look like you guys are interested in anything I have, so I'll go back to my home"
 
We watched him as he walked back, limping with his leg, it looked painful, but he seemed to enjoy it. Every few steps he turned back to wave at us. 
 
"Oh, and there's one Programmer who lives in Rjukan, not here" he said.
 
"Who is that?" Richard said.
 
We waited for Heron to turn around, it was beguilingly slow, and then trace his steps back towards us. We stood silently again, waiting for him.
 
"Old Man Jenkin's he's a bit senile but a good fellow. He knows a lot more about things than people expect, but if I've got one loose leg, he's got two."
 
So he was crazier than this guy, crazy enough for this guy to accept it? Crazy enough for him to know that he had a loose leg?
 
"Trust me" Heron said, "When it comes to a lot of things Im like a butterknife, but with engineering skills I'm like a steak knife. That's why top level players protect me. I don't need to do anything, just spit out more bombs and more arrows and whatnot to please them."
 
"We could use some of those" Richard said. I sighed and also left, I didn't get these two at all. I joined Casey on an upraised platform in the middle of the town. She was sitting on a stone wall and looking up at the sky. I climbed up and sat next to her.
 
"What are you looking at?" I said.
 
"Just the clouds, and wondering where they all go" She looked at me, "Heron's a character isn't he"
 
"Too much" I shook my head. "Maybe next time"
 
"Do you think the Programmer's know any better?" Casey said, "Or do you think they're just as lost as we are?"
 
"I don't know" I said, to be honest the Programmer's might be in a worse place, since they really coudln't do anything about it. If something could be done it would usually be done much earlier. I don't know how much time had progressed since the game started, but it felt like too long.
 
"That's not the answer I was looking for" Casey said, "You were supposed to say something like, 'Oh of course they know, don't worry, everything's going to be all right. We'll get back home." She looked at me and the corners of her lips twisted up, her eyebrows frowned. "Oh, don't look at me with that expression, it's not that bad, you're the one who should be encouraging me, not me encouraging you"
 
"I don't know about this meeting" I said, "But I'm glad to have you here Casey"
 
"Do you say that to every girl you meet?" she said.
 
"Not every girl I meet is called Casey?"
 
"You're right, good job" she leaned her shoulder against me and we fell quiet, listening to the clouds move, listening to them breathing. I wrapped my arm around her shoulders and felt her hair against mine. For a time, I didn't mind leaving or not leaving this world, staying here was comfortable.

### Chapter Twenty Nine
 
"We're going guys" Richard said, he paused when he saw Casey and I so close. We both fell apart and stood up.
 
"Sure" Casey said, "What's happening Mr. Navigator?"
 
Richard looked a bit longer at Casey, "Umm, well the Programmer who lives here, he actually lives twenty miles from here, and in a valley called Rjukan which never has the sun hit it. So they put a mirror up to be able to see it."
 
"Really?" Casey said, "That sounds so cool, how do they see the other side?"
 
"They don't. But anyway, what's going to happen is that this Old Man Jenkin's is a bit antisocial, so he never goes to events. No one has actually seen him before. So we can go to the Programmer's meeting as him."
 
"All three of us?" Casey looked skeptical, "You do realize that there's three of us and one of this Jenkins guy?"
 
"It's okay" Richard said, "Trust me" he smiled, "Heron is a hilarious guy, and he's really really smart."
 
Casey grinned, "What were you guys talking about?" 
 
Richard looked at us, "How about you two? What were you talking about?"
 
We went towards the other side of the wall following Richard. He started pulling at the bricks that started moving. It was a brown sheet that was covering something. The edge of the sheet peeled off, Richard took it and uncovered the object underneath. 
 
"Heron told me that he hid one of the bomb devices here" he said.
 
It was a large metal ball with four 'legs' that supported. The ball looked completely round and unapproachable. It was about the size of an elephants head after a drought.
 
"How big is the explosion?" I couldn't believe something like this would exist, we were in a game, was this all programmed inside it beforehand? How large was this world? 
 
"The latest patch that introduced all of these things with leveling, it also introduced all sorts of other weapons. It's up to us to find out." Richard said, "Heron is an amazing engineer, he's discovered all of these things. His engineer level is far beyond mine."
 
"But what if he is attacked?" Casey said.
 
"Then it's the same as any other skill" Richard said. ""He'll lose it and respawn with all skills at level 1"
 
"So he won't be able to make these things?"
 
"He will have the knowledge of it, but no, he won't be able to make it."
 
"That's why Fermol's theory won't work" Richard said. "Remember he was telling us about how if we can make everyone into level one, then the game can reset itself to its previous framework."
 
I saw what Richard meant, this world was too vast, it was too difficult to become the strongest and try and level the play. Besides there were all these amazing players like Heron who mastered different skills and explored the game.
 
Richard covered up the bomb. He said that Heron left it there as a delivery item to some players who had paid him to make it. We left it behind us and continued towards the meeting area. 
 
"So we're going to pretend to be Old Man Jenkin's?" Casey said.
 
"Yeah" Richard said. "Heron said that's the best way to get in"
 
"But what if this Jenkin's man decides to show up to this meeting?" Casey said.
 
"He won't" Richard led us in the direction. Just a few minutes out of the city we were starting to walk in sandy patches. The terrain in this world changed dramatically, the hard and faultless mountains a few days ago were gone. They had been replaced by slowly morphing sand dunes that blew into the sky.
 
"It should be behind that one" Richard said.
 
I started to wonder what the others would think of us. This was the heart of this game, where all of the originators had gathered. What did they know? How would they treat us?
 
As our steps climbed the last dune, Richard pointed out under us. There were several small buildings with connected walkways. It was too far to see anything, but it looked like a villa hotel in the middle of a moving landscape. There was one path that twisted round and round and led into it. Then as we started our descent I heard shouting and laughing, it was slowly closer. We got off the sand and onto the path. It was made of red bricks that were hammered into place on the sand. 
 
I heard footsteps and looked behind me, there was a huge towering figure walking up behind us, he had a full backpack that looked heavy. He had boots that crunched the bricks into the soft sandiness below. 
 
"Can I pass?" he said. He got one finger and picked his nostril, it looked like a coral fish diving into hairs of sea grass. It surfaced with a plume of transparent liquid. "You guys also going to the meeting?" he said.
 
"Yeah" Casey said.
 
"Hmm" he nodded and walked off past us towards the villa. Now we were closer I could see that there were all sorts of players gathered here. Most of them held expensive looking weapons and gear I had never seen before. They were talking like they knew each other well.
 
There didn't seem to be any other players like us who had wandered here from far away. It was good because we could get in easily, but it also meant that we would be by ourselves.
 
The path curved around once more, then I heard water. Even water was provided for here. Other players started to nod and greet us when we walked past. Most of them had already been settled in their rooms. The entrance was right next to these rooms, a mountain of pairs of shoes were sitting outside. Then there was a girl standing and greeting everyone. Beside her was a big sign that hung from the poles on either side with the words "The Second Meeting Of The Suns" She turned to us with a confused look.
 
"Welcome to the Programmers meeting, and you are?" 
 
Richard stepped forward. "We're Old Man Jenkins"
 
"Excuse me?" I saw that her name was Una and she was level 50. "We? You mean all three of you?"
 
Richard shivered, Una probably didn't see it, but I knew Richard better, and I knew when he wasn't as confident. "Yeah, the three of us"
 
Una looked around, "Umm, I don't know, I have to ask my supervisor, there's a Jenkin's on the list but..."
 
"Do we look like bad guys?" Casey said.
 
"I was told that Jenkins was an old man who lived in Rjukan, and he never came to these events."
 
"That's us" Richard said.
 
Una looked a bit helpless, and I felt a strong pang of guilt at lying. 
 
"Sorry Una" I said. We had to get in, but I didn't want to do it like this.
 
Richard and Casey both glared at me, their eyes were saying "Don't you dare ruin this"
 
"We're not Old man Jenkin's" I said, "He really is an old man somewhere, we're just three players who really wanted to come to this meeting."
 
Una's eyes widened, "So you were lying?"
 
"Why'd you have to ruin it for us?" Richard said.
 
"Would we be able to go in? Maybe take Jenkin's place?" I said.
 
Una sat on the chair behind her, she had tiny petite legs and hair cut like a rice bowl around her. Her long fringe hid her eyes, she looked timid and out of place as soon as we came along.
 
"I have to ask my boss" she said. I was surprised that she had a boss, we were all players here. She scattered around the corner and disappeared. 
 
There was nothing for us to do so we sat down on the bench side by side and waited. The building was the registration area, but we seemed to be one fo the last ones who arrived. More and more players came and went all around us, but the girl never returned, it wasn't supposed to be anything big, but maybe we had changed the order of some system or something.
 
"Do you think this is their way of telling us to leave?" Casey said, "By not coming out?"
 
We sat and sat until the sun started to change. Then a woman came walking out, she was wearing loud high heels that stabbed the ground with every step and echoed it around the villa.
 
"Are you the players who invited yourselves in?"
 
Richard was visibly upset, "Why can't you let us in" Casey held him down and tried to talk to the woman herself. Her name was Madome and she was level 120. I didn't know how all of these players got to such high levels.
 
"I have a room for you three" she said, "Since there's only you three unwelcome players, it should be fine" She made us follow her through a series of wooden walkways. Then there was suddenly a huge influx of people, and then none.
 
"You can stay here" she pointed past a door. "Don't make a sound, and don't wake our precious customers. Dinner's at six, so be in the lounge area by then." Her heels echoed away again. 
 
I slid the door open, inside were stacks and stacks of hay. There was a horse grunting in the corner and a few pigs lying around.
 
We were sleeping in a barn?

### Chapter Thirty
_(Thanks guys for reading this far into the story, I promise that it will start to pick up again!!! All sorts of things have been happening)_
 
 
 
In the afternoon when we woke up, there were stacks of towels around us. Casey said the message was clear, they wanted us clean. There were voices outside, so something was starting.
 
Richard was always optimistic "At least we know they don't think we're pigs" Casey went to wash herself in the river nearby, once she was done, Richard went in. I didn't clean myself. When Casey asked why, I told her that I didn't think we ever got dirty here.
 
She gave me a weird look and put on the rest of her clothes. "Have you ever had a girlfriend?" she asked.
 
"No" I said, "Not in either worlds. Why?"
 
"No reason, just asking" she said. 
 
The three of us walked into the dining hall together, I couldn't believe how extravagant it was, there was golden and red velvet China everywhere, the carpet was a soft creamy colour. And the walls were framed with pictures of famous players who had roamed the lands.
 
"How old is this place?" Casey said, "It seems like it's been standing here forever?"
 
"It has" Richard said, "It was the first place to be designed by the Programmer's it's essentially the centre of this world.
 
"You're right" a man strode into view, he was wearing a tuxedo and had a tray of food. "Everything in this world is essentially revolving around us" he held out a tray of some of the pickings. 
 
"No thanks" I shook my head when I saw what it was, it looked like cream paste on top of cream, covering whatever was inside. 
 
"You don't want one?" he said, "Any of you?"
 
"Uhh...No thanks" Casey said.
 
The man reached out with one hand, drew his sleeve back to expose his bony fingers and then dipped one hand into the spongy picking. He hung it up in front of him and extended his tongue to slurp it up in one mouthful. The leftover cream hung around his lips and teeth. He grinned and wiped himself clean with a handkerchief that came from his power pocket. "Delicious" he muttered and walked off.
 
He was a level 10 player, Deanie. It took me a while to realize he wasn't a computer programmed unit. Then why would a real player be willing to wait on tables for other players?
 
"It's a real hierarchy" Casey said, "I never realized it until we got to this game, but this is the center fo this map, it's where everything originated from, and the hierarchy will be at its worst."
 
There was the sound of a piano being player in the corner of the room. Casey led us towards it, we turned around a wooden pastry, and then there was a man sitting and playing the piano. He was playiung famous classical tunes from masters of the real world, Beethoven, and then Mozart, sometimes with a sprinkling of Rachmaninov or Schostakovich. I began to forget what world we were in, the music was jumbled up with something I remembered and something I forgot. My reality was tangled up like a hairball that had travelled through a cat's guts and come out upside down.
 
The piano player moved back and forth and swayed in rhythm to his playing, he controlled the speed at which the things around us changed. He was wearing an expensive golden watch on one hand, the kind that never failed to make time. His nails were carefully shortened, and his hair was styled like a celebrity. His pants and shirt were made of fine materials that I had only heard of in the game, they required a high level of skill to possess.
 
"He's Hamish" Richard said. "I can't believe he's just sitting here playing the piano, but he's the second highest ranked player in the game"
 
This man was the second highest ranked player? Casey also stared at Richard. "You can't be serious, he's right here? He doesn't seem so strong"
 
"This is the Programmer's meeting" Richard said, "It's where the highest of the highest meet each other"
 
"Does that mean that Guizan will be here?" I said.
 
"Maybe" Richard said. "He is one of the top ranked players after all." He paused for a moment. "Actually, you guys, before she left, Elsie told me that she also might be coming here"
 
"By herself?" Casey said. "Elsie is coming here?" Her expression lightened, "So we can meet her again?"
 
Richard also smiled, "I, hope so too"
 
Some other players entered the room, they walked a few steps around the area looking about like we were, then they left and went back to where they came from. It was still a bit too early for dinner service. The tables were laid out with the cutlery prepared, but nothing was moving.
 
"I want to go and talk to the chefs" Casey said, "I want to ask what kinds of things they are cooking up, and they're cooking skill"
 
"Sure" I said, "Go ahead" 
 
Casey looked at me "Will you come with me?"
 
"I'm listening to this piano music" I said, it was soothing and comfortable. These sounds reminded me just how much I had forgotten about the real world. Memories of my family, my friends, my job, all came flooding back to me. My pregnant wife with the baby I had yet to see. He would probably be born by now, and she would be wondering where I was.
 
"Maybe later" Casey said.
 
The piano playing stopped, and my memories disappeared, Hamish was standing in front of us. his expensive looking attire made what we were wearing look like rags on the side of a street.
 
"You play really well" I said, "You're really talented"
 
"Yeah" Hamish said, "Who are you guys? You're not any programmer's right?" 
 
"Were some players who came from the East mountains" Richard said.
 
His eyes narrowed and he glared down on us. "You came from the East? Why are you here? Do you know who I am?"
 
"We're here to ask questions" I said. "And you're Hamish, the second highest ranked player in this game"
 
"Well no one can answer them for you" Hamish snorted, "Don't expect anything"
 
Hamish clenched his fists. He was level 250, way beyond ours. "You know I can destroy anyone" he said. He tapped on the piano with his knuckles. "Do you want to play a game? I want you to punch me.' He turned to Richard and extended his chest. "Use your strongest weapon and attack me with full force, I promise I won't retaliate, so go on, attack me."
 
Richard looked to us in confusion. Hamish stood in front of him with his chest outstretched. "Go on, I'll show you that I can stop any of your attacks"
 
"I believe you" Richard said. "But we're not here to fight"
 
"Just one shot" Richard said, "I'll show you dogs how strong I am"
 
The corner of Richard mouth twinged, "What did you call us?"
 
"Well that's what you are right? You walk in here as if you own the place, you're not even worthy of it, I coudl just stop all of you here and send you back to respawn. You came from the East mountains, it's far, my girlfriend also came from there. But she's respectful of us"
 
"What are you talking about?" Casey said.
 
"Go on, hit me" Hamish turned to Casey and stood with his chest spread out, "You then, go on, attack me with your full force, one versus one."
 
Casey pulled out her sword. Soon, other players were watching us. Some were sitting on chairs and then glanced over to see what the commotion was.
 
"Don't do it Casey" I said, "You're going to regret it"
 
Casey looked at me, "Don't tell me what I can and can't do, I know I can't touch him, I'm not even like a mosquito against him."
 
Hamish beamed when she said it. "You're a kind girl, so kind and wise. My girlfriend is wise, she's been telling me what I can and can't do. She's like you guys, also from the Eastern Mountains."
 
"There are more important things than this" Casey laughed and sheathed her sword back in its home and backed down. 
 
"You sound like Guizan" Hamish said, "he always talks in a distant tone. And he always asks "Do you know what the most important thing is?"
 
"What is it?" I said,
 
"How would I know? You tell me" Hamish grunted and crossed his arms, "He's a strange character"
 
I felt like that was something I was hearing a lot recently, Richard said it, maybe it was an influence from Guizan that lasted a long time. "I just heard it" Casey said, "That's all"
 
"Is he here?" I really wanted to meet him.
 
Hamish sat down to play the piano again. "Maybe, who knows"
 
I wanted to go away to see if Guizan was here but Casey made me stay. She pulled my arm and made me sit. "What?" I said.
 
"Stay for a moment Kei" she said. 
 
"Why?" 
 
"Just stay and listen, with me"
 
We sat like that for a while, I don't know who went past us and who came in the room. I only felt Casey's hand in mine, it was warm and her pulse jumped through it like the waves hitting the shore on a windy day. I felt all of Casey, her fears and her desires, I didn't know if I had ever been like this with anyone.
 
Hamish played us a couple of songs and then lay back. "Seeing you guys reminds me of my girlfriend. I met her recently, and I think she also overcame a big barrier. She just stepped right over it and was exhilarated, like a long and intense pressure on her shoulders had finally been released and expound." Hamish grunted and stretched his shoulders, I suddenly thought of how strange it was that such a big man was fiddling around with these tiny black and white keys.
 
"I'll destroy anyone, everyone is in my territory" he said. "She loves it when I say that, I think that's why I say it all the time now" He was expressionless, too busy playing to make expressions. "That's why I say it all the time"
 
"Well, your girlfriend" Casey said, "She sounds like she had a hard time but is a very nice person"
 
"Yeah" Hamish said. "She's a very strong character, but resilient enough of changes. She said there were some people she had to leave behind, had enough of, that kind of thing."
 
Casey nodded, "I know that feeling" Her hand was still in mine, I watched as she spoke, she was so lively. I couldn't imagine being here without her. 
 
"Did you go through something like that?" Richard said, "You're rank number two, how is number one?"
 
Hamish gritted his teeth. "I don't want to talk to you about him" He continued to play, "I don't know you well enough for that"
 
We lay back and listened some more, he really had a huge repertoire, it was like we were back there, in the real world. A voice woke us up. I looked up and saw a familiar face, it was Elsie, she was looking at us with a confused expression, she said something to Hamish, he nodded and stood up.
 
"Elsie?" Richard said, "You're actually here, like you promised. I was waiting for you"
 
Elsie was grinning, "You three travelled all the way here, stalking me?"
 
"What?" Richard said. "You said you'd be here"
 
"Do you know them?" Hamish came between us and put his arm around Elsie. "Baby, I've never seen you like this"
 
What was happening here suddenly hit me.
 
I couldn't believe it...

---

### Chapter Thirty One
 
When Richard realized that Elsie was with Hamish he must have felt bad. Many things happened in the world, but we didn't really realize that they also happened in this world.
 
"You two are...together?" Richard tried to smile. "Elsie, how come you're here?"
 
Elsie stared at Richard blankly, "I'm here cause Hamish is here, he brought me"
 
"Since when?" Richard said.
 
"I met Elsie five days ago" Hamish said, "Since then we've been together"
 
"No" Elsie said, she grabbed Hamish's arm, "We only met three days ago remember?" Hamish stood confused for a second then lightened up. "Was it only three days ago? Time flies fast when you're in love"
 
"You guys are Elsie's bullies?" Hamish frowned, "I thought you might look more like bad guys"
 
Elsie gripped Hamish's hand again, "Don't say that kind of thing Hamish, they're guests here as well, treat them with kindness"
 
"Sorry" Hamish grinned at us, "She always picks up my mistakes" 
 
When Elsie was done snoggling up to Hamish, she turned to us with a strange grin on her face, her eyebrows were upraised and there was a grin that said she knew something we didn't. And she did, we never expected her to be here, and witht he second highest ranked player.
 
Suddenly a series of heaters lit up with red long lights in the middle. They warmed us up, but Elsie was still smiling through them.
 
Hamish's expression changed, he seemed to show a weariness, like Guizan had. "I'm not too sure about what's happening here" he said, "I don't think you guys are either" He sat back down at the piano, but instead of playing, he stroked the keys tenderly, like little pets.
 
"Just now I thought you were my friends" he said. "We were playing music, but now I think you are my enemies" Some other players came forward and stood between Elsie and us. I briefly noticed some fo their names as the top ranked players. They had entered in between us flowing like a dance in nature. 
 
Richard was the first to leave. He just turned around and left to where no one could see him. Elsie watched him go and smiled, not a normal smile, something about it was off. She hugged Hamish who was next to her and smiled like that.
 
"Hamish is like a jester." I thought, he was hiding his true self, a deep and thoughtful side of himself. That was why someone loose and playful like Elsie could be with him.
 
When Casey and I finally found him, he was lying half submerged in the hay stacks in the barn. "I don't want to be here" he said. Casey and I looked at each other, 
 
"Should we go back?" She said. First quietly, then louder with more determination, "Should we go back?"
 
"I followed her all the way here, I never even thought that this would happen, not here"
 
"She's fake" Casey said, "She just wants to climb up the ranks by grasping onto powerful men. Have you heard what the others are saying about her? They're calling her a screen hopper" 
 
"Screen hopper?" Richard laughed. "Is that because she's always around the High score area"
 
"Changing screens" Casey said. She put her hand on Richard's. "She's just different to who we thought she would be. So, should we go back?"
 
"Go back?" Richard said, "Go back where?"
 
I don't know about them, but that hit me really hard. It told me that we had been wanting to come here, which felt like we didn't belong; a nowhere. And now that we were nowhere, we wanted to go back to somewhere else. The thought was too powerful, too strong, I didn't want to think about it. I stood up and kicked some haystacks around, even taking a step outside to look at the sunset. The sand dunes reflecting pure colors into the bare sky.
 
Richard sulked for a while, but when he finally stood up, it was with conviction. "Let's go to dinner" he said. Casey and I smiled, the one who wanted to leave the most was now looking forward to it.
 
When we walked into the dining room everyone was there. Una came forward to welcome us. "You guys a late" she said, "But I have a table saved for you, just go over there" I saw a tiny table in the corner of the room. Elsie was sitting in the middle with Hamish and some other extravagant looking players sitting enxt to them.
 
"At the Programmer's meetings" Una said, "Believe it or not, we try to welcome everyone. We're all trapped in here after all, don't feel bad about it. Some people are harder to get along with, but we're all people after all.." 
 
Casey looked at Una and grunted, we all knew she meant the top ranked players. "We understand your position" Una looked confused so I just nodded, "Thank you Una"
 
We sat at the table quietly. There were so many people here that I didn't know what to do. After a while, there was the sound of a fork clanging on a cup, then we all turned to see who was talking. It was Fermol. I barely recognized him, he lookef much more presentable, and he wasn't in a rush, just comfortable here. Casey leaned over to us, "He looks like my boyfriend, you know, back in the real world." 
 
Richard laughed, "You mean Ex-boyfriend right?" 
 
Casey shrugged, "Haven't seen him in a while now, I guess we're not together anymore, I haven't really thought about him much."
 
I wondered what kind of person this boyfriend of Casey's was, what kind of guy did she admire and want to be with? Did he look like Fermol, was he much older?
 
"Did your boyfriend have black hair as well?" I asked her. 
 
Casey almost coughed out the water she was drinking, "Sorry, I didn't expect you to ask about him. Um, yeah I think he did"
 
Richard's eyebrows rose, "You're not sure? You don't know the color of your boyfriend's hair?" In this game everyone had all sorts of variants of hair colors, but in the real world there were only a few.
 
Casey's eyes widened, "I guess I really haven't thought about him in a while"
 
"Every second guy you see looks like your boyfriend" Richard said. We both looked at her, when Casey saw me looking, she blushed.
 
"Stop staring" she said, "It's true, I haven't seen him in a while, I might not know him as well as I used to"
 
"Did you ever know him?" Richard said, "What he says, what he always does, and what kinds of things make him sad?" Richard talked quietly, but I could tell that he was talking about himself, he liked her so much that it was all flowing out.
 
"Of course" Casey said, There were times when I would be at home thinking all about him, be happy when he would call me, and get sad when he didn't text back. Every girl's gone through that. But now that we're here, and I haven't seen him in a while, sometimes I wake up and then I've forgotten to think about him, it's become something I have to force myself to do." She looked at us and bit her lip, "And then maybe one day I won't know about him anymore, it's already happening"
 
What did that mean about us? Did that mean that we might all forget about each other?
 
"I won't forget you guys" Casey said, "When we leave here, I will try not to forget about you guys, that's why I want to enjoy my time here with you guys for as long as I can" She stopped talking and looked around, everyone around us had fallen silent.
 
Una was standing in the corner of the room, she gently banged a slender fork against a slender glass. "Everyone, I would like to warmly welcome you to the second meeting of the suns"
 
The players clapped, a few voices cheered. 
 
"The objective of our gathering here today is to discuss an update to the current situation"
 
"Going home" someone said. Laughter burst out all around him.
 
I didn't understand how that was funny. Casey leaned over, "They've given up" she said. "They think it's funny" It reminded me of the time when we were at the respawning area, when the players were all joking about the game. It made me feel foolish to still be serious about leaving.
 
Richard looked at me, "Don't give up Kei, remember, we said we were going to leave here no matter what"
 
"Of course" I said, but my voice didn't sound as strong as I wanted it to.
 
But that made me wonder, if no one was serious about it, then why were they discussing leaving the game?
 
"It's to do with the hierarchy" Casey sounded disgusted, "That's why everyone's here, to show that they are powerful players, and just for a social gathering. Of course there are players who are serious about leaving the game, but their voices are drowned out by majority consensus"
 
Of all of these players, everyone was cheering and laughing, enjoying themselves. Which one of these players was thinking about leaving, and which ones were content with staying here? I looked at Elsie, she was the center of attention at her table, her mouth was moving and everyone else listened in, some of the guys were leaning forward to hear her properly in the commotion. Every now and then she said a joke that caused them to laugh out.
 
Was she trying to leave the game? Or was she staying here? 
 
I felt a tap on my shoulder. I spun around to see Guizan standing behind me. "Guizan" I said
 
"Nice to see you here Kei, I'm glad you came" Guizan looked very tired, there were huge bags under his eyes and his armor was covered in dirt. He turned and greeted Casey and Richard as well.
 
"Did you just get here?" I didn't see him earlier.
 
"Yes, I just had some things I had to do" He wiped a bit of the dirt off his armor. I saw a few faces looking at Guizan, and then at me, who was talking to him. Every action here was watched.
 
"We can't really talk here" Guizan said, "But the game has changed dramatically. Would you like to talk tonight?"
 
"Sure" I said.
 
"Okay" Guizan nodded and we made a time to meet. he moved to another table and sat down, there were instantly welcoming cheers rewarding him. He was really popular.
 
He sat at the table but looked at me once for a long time before turning back to the conversation.
 
I couldn't imagine where Guizan had gone, but with him here, I suddenly felt empowered, because someone who supported us was here.
 
Now I knew why no other casual players were here. They weren't really welcome.
 
---

### Chapter Thirty Two
 
Una told us about the things that were being done around us. She read out all sorts of statistics but I didn't understand them. The numbers of low level players to high level players, and how many players were still level 1. It meant that they were being farmed. I was shocked to hear that the figure was close to 50%. That meant that 50% of players were not given a chance to progress in the game. 
 
The number of players turnning level 2 was only about 1%. Which meant that once a player became level 1, it was difficult to climb out and start leveling again, because other players would just attack them again.
 
I couldn't believe that this was happening, I had never attacked another player, yet it was rampant through the game. 
 
Una cleared her voice, had a cup of water and continued, "Our analysts have looked back to the genesis" The genesis was the period when we had first entered the game. That was what it had started to be called.
 
"We have confirmed that a player cheated and diverted the system packets to respond to the dormant system and create it anew. Because of this, we are unable to log out currently."
 
I had heard and thought about the information so many times already that it wasn't supposed to affect me, but it did. Because of one person's selfishness, now we were all forced to remain here.
 
"Our chief Programmers, the first five, have agreed that if all of the players levels were to be reset to what they were initially at the moment the cheat was consulted, then it is possible to revert to original gameplay and log out.
 
Log-Out. 
 
That word seemed to be like a heaven-sent gift. I wished we would be able to see it, I wished that at that moment what seemed like so long ago, I had pressed it and left this game immediately.
 
But then I looked at Casey and Richard, even Elsie, I never would have met them. Never would have travelled together and joked around about things that weren't funny.
 
"In case you didn't know, the five programmers who first stepped into this world, they are the ones who designed this whole world, made the foundations of code" Una looked around, "We have four of them here with us today, could I invite them to come up and stand " Four players stood up and walked to the front there was one woman, she had extremely bad posture and glasses that covered her nose. I swear she was the oldest person I had seen in the game.
 
"These people have all of the knowledge, so if you have any questions, come and ask them" she said. Una looked a bit hesitant to say the next part, "They're really friendly...so come and talk to them" Players started laughing, even I had to, she sounded so unconvinced.
 
After dinner finished, talking started. Richard, Casey and I didn't have much to say, Richard said he had enough and went to sleep early. Casey and I stayed behind, we talked a bit about things. I teased her about her boyfriend. A part of me wanted to know what kind of person he was.
 
"So are you going to ask Fermol?" I said, "If he knows your boyfriend?"
 
"Why would he know?" Casey said, "He's not my boyfriend"
 
"How about Richard" I said, "Does he look like your boyfriend as well?" Casey chuckled to herself, "Yeah, a bit"
 
I laughed, then Casey looked at me "You think I'm funny?"
 
"Yeah why not?" I straightened up to look at her. 
 
"Well my boyfriend didn't think so"
 
"How about Hamish? Does he look like your boyfriend"
 
"Just about 2%" Casey said.
 
"As opposed to 3 or 4 percent?"
 
Casey shrugged, "Yeah, not that much"
 
We both looked over to their table, most of the others had left, but their table was still talking at full volume, I heard Elsie loudly complaining about something. 
 
"She seems to be enjoying it" Casey said, "Don't you think?"
 
She sure looked like she belonged there, she knew everything much better.
 
"I hope she is happier there" Casey said.
 
I stayed around, and Casey did as well, we were spending a lot more time together recently, I was getting used to having her presence nearby.
 
After we fell silent, Elsie's voice projected across the room, we could hear her talking about some particular skills, and some terminology we weren't familiar with. She was complaining about one of the other players who always annoyed her. 
 
In the end, when their table finally stood up to leave, Elsie walked past us without saying anything, I didn't dare look up, and she never turned our way either.
 
I just stared at Casey, she was looking at her nails, so I looked at her nails "Did she go?" She turned to look where they had left
 
"Yeah, they've gone" I said.
 
Guizan came over and sat down at our table. "How are you enjoying things?" he said, "Is it as you expected?" 
 
I shook my head, "I didn't know what to expect, but this seems completely civilized"
 
He laughed, "Yup, people are adapting to this world, there's only a few players left who are nostalgic about the real world and want to return now." He moved a chair in and sat down. "Do you have time now, to talk?" He looked at Casey and me.
 
"Yeah" I said, "There's nothing else happening"
 
"Okay" Guizan turned serious, his eyes were sparkling with a passion. "Let me tell you everything I know, from the start, the moment of genesis, when this game started."
 
Guizan turned and called Una over. "Can we get a glass of milk?"
 
Una nodded and smiled, "Are you keeping them up to date?"
 
"Yeah" Guizan said.
 
Una brought the water over, then she also pulled in a chair and sat down. Her hair ran down the right side of her face, and she placed her left palm on her cheek and leaned forward to listen, like she was used to doing it.
 
Guizan shared the water around with us.
 
Una looked at me, "You're Kei right?"
 
I nodded, "How come?" 
 
"And you guys are the sparkling dragons?"
 
"What about us?" 
 
"So you must be the players who were travelling with Elsie." Una said, "In my job I hear a lot of what is happening, you guys sure are famous"
 
"You heard about us?" Casey said
 
"Everyone here's going on about Elsie, Elsie this, Elsie that, so we were curious to see who it was that were Elsie's previous teammates. She's really popular around here, she brings a liveliness that a lot of the other players don't have. But we all heard the story of how she had trouble with her previous group." Una looked at us, still with her cheek leaning on her palm, with her other hand she drew circles on the table. "You guys have a bad reputation, but when I saw you walking in, you didn't seem like bad players, trust me I've seen all sorts, and you guys aren't some of them." Una went on, "You guys came up to me one by one when we were alone to tell me about your friend who had left, and how you felt bad about it. Everyone was saying Elsie this, Elsie that, I was wondering how long it would take till one of you finally would talk to me about it"
 
"To be honest" I said, "I don't know her for much longer than others have, we just formed a team at the start, that's all"
 
"Hmm" Una sighed, "But I think you two are quite similar"
 
"How so" Now I was curious. Una opened her mouth to speak, but Guizan interrupted.
 
"Can I start now?" he said, "With a bit of history"
 
Una smiled and put her hand on Guizan's shoulder. "Sorry, I started talking again, once I start I don't stop for a whole night, that's what he tells me." 
 
Guizan looked to the side, then back at us. "Okay" He rubbed his hands together, "Let's begin"
 
---

### Chapter Thirty Three - Talk #1
 
Guizan positioned us on the comfortable chairs outside to look into the breeze and the trees. There was no smell of Carbon Monoxide, or chemicals in the atmosphere, no haze or smog to obstruct our vision, only colonies of ubiquitous clouds of water vapour that never settled and kept on changing.
 
"""
If there are players who have given up trying to leave this world, then there are the same number of players also trying to leave. Then, to complicate things, there is an equal number of players trying to stop other players from leaving. 
 
In this world if a player leaves then the pool of players decreases in total and is not replenished. It's unrealistic compared to the real world where populations expand and contract depending on a variety of factors. So those players who love this world are most afraid of their world changing, even if a few players leaves, the synapses and interactions of the global community will vary, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad.
 
Some of the programmers or exceptionally enthusiastic players have made analyses of this game world. The number of male players is five thousand twenty four; the number of female players is less than a quarter of that. Many men have realized this already and changed their actions accordingly.
 
This meeting, the gathering of the suns, is called after the programmer's, some of them call themselves the sun, enlightening the world. As opposed to the darkness that is in the absence of the light. This is the second meeting, so most of these members have met already, some have met privately to discuss matters and how they want to sway the game. The small details believe it or not, are not arbitrary, they've been meticulously decided by these cunning players. 
 
So, this meeting of the suns is more of a social and political gathering than a scientific one. The purpose of it has been diluted and distracted, like a riverbed with thousands of rocks thrown in so that we don't know which current to follow. That's why the hierarchy comes in, although the original game only had one list for top rankings, these players have organized themselves up into hierarchical differences, Hamish and the top players are at the very top. But even they don't have all the power, and need to rely on others.
 
What I'm trying to say is that this game has changed rapidly, no one would have expected it's fast change, but the social connections are like strings tugging on everything. The most important things are not levels, not diamonds, but something else, far more elusive.
 
The clouds cleared and the night sky shone through, the moon making itself seen through the miles and miles of cool dancing air. Before I knew it, Guizan had stopped, he was also looking into the horizon. We stayed like this for a while, nothing could distract us at this time of the night, there was no need to rush, time stood slowly. The night sky was empty, there were no stars. There was nowhere to travel to, and no one was looking at us, watching down on us from afar.
 
Finally, Guizan breathed out deeply, exhaling plumes of fatigue and botanical smells into the air. Then when he was ready, and I was ready, and Casey was ready, and Una was ready, he began to speak
 
This is a game world, but there is a still history, the programmers were very thorough in their creation. This area here we're sitting in is where the current top ranked player, Lahoe, first reached level ten.
 
In other words, this is where the legendary sword, the Lime Green Sword first appeared in the world. I watched as he equipped it, there was a huge blast of green thunder from the sky, and he started to grow in size, possessing a great unique power. That was the day he became invincible.
 
I looked at what was happening and decided to target the team members. I was familiar with game systems, but even I was astonished to see how fast Lahoe was progressing. The rest of his team worked hard to ensure that he would come out at the top. The reason I was here was also because I had a team supporting me, I was level 9 at the time, just seconds behind Lahoe in my leveling. But at that moment, there were only the two of us standing here, and he was the winner. I had lost.
 
Lahoe didn't even bother to attack me, he grinned and walked away. He knew that I knew that he was invincible. 
 
But I didn't give up, I went to attack his teammates, they were all much weaker, because they had been feeding Lahoe. Sheila, and then three more players. I came here just after defeating the last one. Now Lahoe as no one to support him. I'm sure he knows that, but he's not afraid, because the sword is the strongest thing in this world, he doesn't think anyone can defeat him.
 
But the truth is that he has lost a lot of his power after losing his teammates, power in this game is not levels, and it's not the number of diamonds you possess, it's something else.
 
I'm not the only one who knows about this, the other ranked players have all been watching my actions, and Lahoe's every move. They are standing around him like vultures, ready to seize the sword off him whenever he falters. Every single step that Lahoe makes, he has twenty others treading his path, as soon as he slows down or trips, he will lose the sword. He knows that, and that's why he's not here at the meeting, he's too afraid.
 
I want to go back to the real world. I came here a long time ago looking for someone, but I can't find her anymore, so I want to go back. Kei, Casey, If you want to go back to the real world, then you need to trust me. We need to get the sword. That's our only option. 
 
We have to steal it off Lahoe.
 
"""
 
Guizan moved in his position, to comfort himself.

### Chapter Thirty Four - Talk #2
 
Guzian smiled, this was a smile that spoke of long stories and a bittersweetness. 
 
"I originally came here because I was looking for my girlfriend. She came into this game and told me how much fun it was. But I've been looking for her, going to the places she would go, but there is nothing, not even a sign of her ever having been here. If she was here, then I don't know if I would still try to be leaving. In the meantime" Guizan put his arm around Una, "I've found Una, she's kind, so we're settled for now"
 
Casey was looking at this wide-eyed. She was also looking for her boyfriend. 
 
"Anyway, Kei, Hamish will try to overthrow Lahoe as well, and maybe Elsie." 
 
Una interjected, "Do you know what they call her?" she said, "The lower players call her a screen hopper. It's a derogatory term aimed at players who cling onto other players to 'hop' through the top ranked screens."
 
"In other words" Guizan said, "Elsie's a gold digger, shes reaching for the top like a bush lawyer, a prickly vine that sticks onto other trees and grows like an epiphyte."
 
I was glad Richard wasn't here. Only the moon and the clouds were in front of us. Guizan's voice was as clear as the pale wind.
 
"Let me show you something" Guizan looked at me. "You will find this extremely interesting" Casey stayed behind to talk to Una while Guizan led me to another place.
 
"You remember how I was saying that this place was really old? The first place that the programmers designed in this world, it has a digital historical significance."
 
I nodded.
 
"Well, there's a little book here with a little interesting piece of history written down"
 
I recognized the words, they were the first words to scour the screen the moment the game started. I don't think anyone could have forgotten them.
 
People talked about the sword from when it was first made in the game. 
 
It had the power of a thousand birds, the ferocity of ten thousand screaming warriors, and a sharpness to slice the world in half.
 
But no one had seen the sword for the last two million years.
 
And it had been reduced to something of the legends.
 
"Those words are written down here, in this book. This mode of the game was designed around this room." Guizan said, "More specifically, around this super weapon of which there is only one of, this sword."
 
Guizan sat down in the corner and let out a sigh, it wasn't a normal sigh, but one which let hundreds of bacteria loose into the air. The depths of him surfaced with that sigh, roamed around aimlessly for a while, and then returned to where they came from. "Why don't you give it a read?" Guizan said, "It's written like a picture book that children will read, there are large short sentences on each page, except instead of pictures it is a blank white sheet."
 
He picked it up and offered it out to me. "It's better if you read it now, I've read it so many times, but haven't got anywhere with it."
 
He opened up the first page and offered it to me. I didn't want to take it, for some reason I didn't want to read the book, I knew that it had unwelcoming thoughts hidden inside. But at the same time, I couldn't reject Guizan's advances, he seemed really interested to see me read this book.
 
"When you finish it" he said, "Answer me why. I'll be just outside the entrance." 
 
I sat down and haphazardly started reading it. I didn't know where this book came from or what it meant, but Guizan really wanted me to read it, I could sense it from his reverence.
 
Once upon a time, a long long time ago. There were twenty kings spread out all over the world. One day, all of the kings gathered together to merge into a unified government, but the kings couldn't agree on who the leader was, so they made a big game that looked and felt exactly like their country, and then they became the kings of this country in the same way.
 
Clause 1: Even now, to this day, the descendants of these kings are heavily protected and any injury or damage dealt to them will be treated as damage dealt to the country itself.
 
There were a lot of people in the world, they worked everyday, and they worked some more. They only knew work. They grew tired of working, so one day they made other people out of clay and greenstone. But their plan went wrong, and these people didn't need to work. One day, the king became satisfied with his life, he realized he doesn't need to work anywhere. Doesn't need to clean himself, doesn't need to say a word to tell anyone anything or communicate himself. The gods become upset because he is living more comfortably than they are, they decide to split him into two equal halves. They give one a tongue, so he has to talk for the rest of his life, and then the other ears, so he has to listen. That way he will be forced to work everyday, because communication is the most tiring thing.
 
Then he meets his other self and talks to her while the other listens
 And they pretended to be humans for the rest of eternity.
 
That King's name is Kei. But he's the only one who knows it, his real name is Nagamoto Keisuke.
 
(Change the story so that it is about commitment? Instead of being split in two, he is split so that he can't commit to one person and can only find the other half to be able to do so)
 
I froze, Nagamoto Keisuke, I hadn't heard it in a while, but it was what everyone used to call me. My name, my real name back in the real world, but why here? Why was it here?
 
I had prepared myself never to hear it again.
 
"That's my name" I said, "Guizan, why is this written here; why is this written here?"
 
Guizan stood up from his seat, his arms were still crossed, he had a frown written on his countenance. "I thought you would know, all of the signs were pointing to you. You're somehow important in this world."
 
"Me?" I said, "Why me?" It made me out to be someone special, it was wrong, I wasn't special like that. Guizan was wrong.
 
"Your name was written on there" Guizan said.
 
---

### Chapter Thirty Five - Talk #3
 
Guizan tore his gaze off me and walked past. He brought out another book from the shelf with direction, it looked dustier, the front cover dangled on a few strings. Guizan carefully opened it only after setting it on the table, I noticed that his fingers looked smoothed and polished, and his shoulder was rounded at a perfect right angle. Like a statue.
 
"That wasn't the only story" Guizan said, "Whoever wrote it drafted other versions of the same story, but they weren't as perfect so they were thrown away. We don't know why, but we know what was changed."
 
He sighed and offered out the book. He only made a quiet breathing sound that was not dissimilar to a million waves hitting the shoreline of a gigantic momentous country. I opened the book, I didn't realize that my hands were trembling until I started to read, my mouth was parched, like all of the liquid had been sucked away.
 
The pages in my hands were torn asunder, scribbles formed the majority of the page. The handwriting was terrible, and it was almost illegible.
 
But I could read it fine.
 
The start was the same, but it quickly diverged into something completely different. 
 
There were twenty kings who united to form a single government. But in this government there was one king who was the most powerful, and beautiful. The gods created the kings to work, and they warned the kings that there would be a punishment if they didn't. Every night the people sang a song to remember their past, "Those who live rightly return to the stars, but those who are cowards or lead unrighteous lives change into women" All of the kings knew of the difference between the sexes, the male gives form, and the woman gives matter. If a woman has good skin, it means that she will be good matter, and the child will be a girl, because girl children have the form from their mother and the matter of their father. A boy child will have a strength and ability that will raise the heavens, but he will be squishy and weak, because there is no matter.
 
Then I turned the page.
 
But a truly mature woman will have thrown away this matter and be only form, and join the realms of men.
 
The air that blew past was warm, warmer than the cold air.
 
The gods were dissatisfied with one king who ruled all of the kings. He was righteous and strong, but he was also weak and slimy. The gods were afraid of this strange king and decided to split him in half, so that he would be either a male man or a female man.
 
I felt Guizan's hand on my shoulder. "It's strange isn't it? And yet, it's so captivating. What do you think of it Kei?"
 
I shook my head, the story was weird, too weird. Yet I felt some part of me understood it deeply.
 
"Go on" Guizan said, "There's still another version."
 
After a few pages of scribbles, I found another page with a sentence scrawled across it. It was written in a font that looked liek clippings cut out form a newspaper. 
 
"The King looked like a young woman. But he lied about it whenever the gods asked him, so they decided to cut him in half, one half being a young woman and the other half being an old man. The young woman always attracted attention wherever she went, and she was kind. But when people asked her where she came from and she explained, they never believed her. The old man always lied about everything, but everyone believed every word he said.
 
But one day the most beautiful goddess came along and healed him, she felt sorry for the old man so she went to search for the young woman. She found her and combined the two together again. They had four arms and four legs. She recognized the king immediately and started to take a liking to him. Before too long, she fell completely in love with him.
 
But the king started to lie again, so she got upset and sliced him in half again, this time with toes that never stopped growing, and hair that never stopped growing. Because he was so strange, the other kings ignored his reasoning. The king was forced to act and dress like a woman in order to climb back up the social ladder.
 
I stopped reading and turned the page, it was signed.
 
"Aloola"
 
"Who's that?" I showed Guizan. He wriggled towards me and laughed. 
 
"She's one fo the programmer's" He said. "We call her the first programmer"
 
"The first programmer?" I said. A gust of wind suddenly blew and triggered a fall of leaves, bypassing between us, and taking up the air.
 
"I'm not the one who should tell you about it" Guizan said, "It wouldn't be right if it came from me, but go and ask one of the programmers next time, they all know about it, it's a big event in their time."
 
"Okay" I said, "And can I ask a question"
 
"Sure" Guizan said, "Although it's supposed to be me who's asking the questions"
 
"That split up person" I said, "That king in the story, who was it?"
 
"I don't know" Guizan said, "But isn't it strange? Why would Allola write all of that, and why did she make so many draft versions, of which only one of them is complete. What's the difference?" 
 
"I don't know, we'd have to ask her" I said. "Is she here?"
 
"She's not at this meeting" Guizan said. "You have to ask the programmer's about it, I won't tell you"
 
There were so many incomplete versions of the story that were slightly different. Why did the author choose this specific version of it?
 
"Look at the ending, the year that's written down, LXXII, corresponds to our years in the real world. It was written in 1923, when the first internet documents were made in the world." It was dated for thousands of years in the game world, who knew what that was in the real world.
"No they weren't" I knew my history.
 
"Yeah, I'm just joking" Guizan said, "But isn't it amazing?"
 
I don't know why Guizan was grinning, it wasn't amazing, it was eerie, and a little scary. Whoever, or wherever this document came from, it knew things about me that no one else did.
 
"It's false right?" I said, "This is just some history they made up, and it's supposed to reflect the name of the player who uses it. That just happened to be me"
 
"You can think so" Guizan said, "Or it might not, I don't know, but isn't it fascinating?"
 
I didn't get what he was so fascinated about, it was making me uncomfortable. I didn't want to read that story anymore.
 
"This is the oldest room in this world" Guizan said. To him it wasn't a game, it was a world. "But to us it's the newest." He picked up one of the books in the shelf. "And look how there're so many books here, they're old and rusting, these flaps, look." He showed me one of the rusty flaps and I looked and nodded.
 
"But we always think that it's because they're old, that they don't matter, that they're not as relevant. But actually it's all the same, old things new things, so what if I write a new date on this book, then it's suddenly a new one right?"
 
Guizan took out his sword and carved a date on the book, "2015, May the fifth."
 
"There" he pondered his work, "Now let's just think about that, and then maybe we'll better see how our information of the world is made, all around these times. What if we change them around, will we see something different?"
 
I sat on the ground, speechless.
 
I felt like we were in a museum in this world. Almost like when I was a child, somewhere, sometime. 
 
"You're right" I said. It was too early to make assumptions and have ideas about the things that were happening around us. Suddenly I understood what was happening, in a moment of clarity I felt like I knew where we were, in this extremely realistic game, playing roles of characters that we never really knew. All in multiple different cultures due to our sudden change in environment. Guizan in front of me was just one of these people.
 
"Guizan" I said, "I know why you're so fascinated with me" 
 
"I am?" He grinned, "Why?"
 
"Unduly so" I said, "It's because I have a purpose, and something that's happening to me" I said, "I know why I am here, and because I know that, I know why I need to leave"
 
Guizan stood still the grass nipped at his boots as the wind swept over them.
 
"Maybe so" he said.

### Chapter Thirty Six
 
I sneaked back into the barn, the door creaked like a sneeze and let a piercing of light into the barn. Casey was already asleep, she snored at night, the Sparkling Dragons had been travelling together for so long that I knew these things. On the other side of the barn was Richard, half buried in stacks of hay. His eyes were open and he was looking up at the roof. It was a silent night outside, so quiet that I thought I could hear his blinking.
 
Richard turned his head to see me, he raised his hand to say hi, then turned back around to face the wall. He must have had a lot on his mind, considering how he came all this way expecting to meet Elsie again. None of us had expected anything like this to happen.
 
I quietly lay down on the hay and pondered about things, where we were, what we were doing, and now, why my name was written in that book. The Aloola person who wrote it, did she know about me? Why else would she use my name.
 
What frightened me the most was that I understood the story, I felt like I knew what she was trying to say. What she wrote down there were the first pieces of information to be made in this world, it was what came straight after the programming environment was coded.
 
Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep, my eyes moved around and saw darkness. I felt like I slept for a few hours, but no one really knew until the sun came back up.
 
I moved my hand and the familiar screen appeared, it showed buttons and all sorts of settings. I almost laughed, this game had taken into account everything, it was truly impressive, amazing. It didn't have the capability to understand humans, but it had everything else. Everything except that which was most important.
 
The next morning Casey stood in front of me. "Come on, let's go" she said, "Let's go, let's go, let's go!" She pulled me up and brought me closer to her. "I believe Guizan showed you something interesting" She pronounced the word interesting like she was eating a soft chocolate. "Richard's already gone in to have breakfast, so we need to go and keep him company"
 
But we were wrong, Richard was looking sprightly, "I was really excited to meet Elsie" he said, "And I still like her, but I've decided not to think about it too much, thinking about it really leads to nowhere"
 
Casey and I grinned and looked at each other. "I just had to go and pull Kei out of that smelly barn, he will be sleeping all day, and would have missed the talks"
 
That's right, I almost forgot, but this was the Programmer's meeting, a symposium of people who were knowledgeable about these subjects. We were here to learn about this game, and ultimately here to leave this game.
"I saw you last night, talking with Guizan at the museum" I snapped around to see a voice behind me, it was much older than mine, I recognized it as one of the players who was organizing this event with Una.
 
Casey must have been around, because she smiled to him, "Hi Heron" she said, "It's nice to see that you finally noticed us"
 
Heron, where had I heard that name before, that's when it hit me, he was the guy who was talking to Richard when we were on our way over here. How had I forgotten him so easily?
 
"You're the Sparkling Dragons right? With Richard?"
 
"Yeah" I said. He was an engineer, so I wondered what he was doing here.
 
"I'm one of the organizers" He said, "In case you were wondering".
 
"We weren't" Casey gave a mock smile and pulled me along. She was acting strangely rude. The usual Casey was always extremely polite and caring, but she seemed agitated.
 
Once we were to the side, she pulled me towards her and started speaking really quickly. "Kei, this morning I woke up early" she said, "I saw Guizan and started talking to him"
 
"Okay" I nodded, I had no idea where this was going.
 
"Guizan and I had a little heart to heart, there was no one else around us, so we just started talking about ourselves. And before long I was telling him about why I was here, to look for my boyfriend." 
 
Now I noticed the expression Casey had wasn't just agitated, there was an excitement and a hope embedded in it as well. Her eyes looked alive and bubbly, her rounded jaw didn't stop moving as the words started to pour out. 
 
"Then guess what Kei, it turns out that Guizn also came here because he was looking for his girlfriend. ho cool is that, so we're kind of the same"
 
"What?" Now that I thought about it, I didn't know much about Guizan, why he was here, and what he was doing. It didn't seem like him to come all the way here for a lost girlfriend. Besides, why was Casey so excited about this?
 
"Oh you didn't know?' Casey looked at me, her mouth stopping for a second and curving into a round ball. "Since you were so close to him, I thought you would know. I guess guys don't talk that much about this kind of stuff."
 
I turned to look at her, "What do you mean, guys don't talk about this kind of stuff?" I didn't talk to Guizan much, but at least we understood each other.
 
"I don't mean it like that, I mean girl stuff" she said, "Oh it was so sweet, he said that" she giggled and broke her sentence, "Can you believe it, what kind of guy says this stuff. He said that he has grown tired of looking for this girl, he came to this world to find her, but he can't even find a trace of her. That's why he wants to get the green sword, so he has some power to be able to find her."
 
"So what did you say?"
 
"So I said that I knew how he felt, and that I would help him with all of my heart, I really wanted him to find this girl you see. But then he said the sweetest thing of all." Casey took a deep breath and stared at me with her eyes barely blinking. "Guizan said that when he met a person who would tell him why he was living, what was his purpose in being here, then he would buy a ring and marry her. Even if Una, who he's always with now, said that tomorrow, then he would try and marry her, or try and get as close to them as the game system allowed. But he has settled with her now because there was no one else. He originally came to this world to look for a wife"
 
I didn't need to ask who it was. Because I knew that I was the one who told Guizan how he should live and what he is living for. For a moment, the clouds cleared and I could see who he was. 
 
That seemed to have affected him in a strong way.
 
"Isn't he great?" Casey said, "I'm so glad Guizan's here with us, I don't know what we would do without his help"
 
The cutlery clanked around us as people started to come in for breakfast. I sa most of the people from yesterday, and then Elsie and Hamish also walked past us. Hamish nodded to us in greeting, but Elsie held her nose up, she didn't even want to breathe the same air as us.
 
I looked back in front of me to Casey, she was still looking at me, waiting for a response. I didn't know what to say, what did the men in the world say in this situation? Was it written down somewhere?
 
I told Guizan my real name" Casey said. 
 
"Your real name?" I didn't even know about it. "It's not Casey?"
 
"No, my name from the real world, the one we used to live in" I couldn't believe that such a remarkable girl was standing in front of me, pouring her heart out, and smiling to see me here. There was something about it that made me...blush. I don't know if it was because it was Casey, but I was glad to have her here. It was almost like we were in a relationship, talking like this.
 
"My real name is something else" she said, "Guizan knows it now." Then Casey looked concerned, "It wasn't the first time he heard it."
 
"What do you mean, he knows someone with the same name as you, back in the real world?"
 
"No" Casey said, "He knew me"
 
Then she sighed. With that sigh, the tone completely changed.
 
"I was his girlfriend"
 
---

### Chapter Thirty Seven
 
Casey was looking back at me without blinking, "Do you believe me, I was his girlfriend"
 
"No you weren't you can't be" I didn't know why I was speaking so strong. "I was with you in this game from the start, remember?"
 
Casey smiled, "Back in the real world, my boyfriend's name was Guizan. You guys were joking about him, that I didn't know, but now I'm sure of it, he was Guizan." She looked around the room, as if to look for Guizan, the man of her life. "I came here to this game to look for him, he had been here for a while."
 
"Does he know this?" I was stunned, "Does Guizan know that you were with him?"
 
"I'm not sure" Casey said, "I didn't tell him" Then she looked at me again, her eyes had been dozing off on other places, but her gaze finally concentrated on me. "I wanted to tell you first Kei"
 
"Me, why?"
 
"Because you're special Kei, do I have to say it? You're special to me now" She bit her lip, "I'm feeling really mixed up about this, it's good that I've run into Guizan again, but I also don't know anymore, my life has changed so much ever since coming here, it's not like we're back in the real world again."
 
"So that girlfriend that Guizan said he came to look for..."
 
"That was me" Casey said, pointing a timid finger at herself, "I can't believe I'm that girl." Her eyes were trying to read mine, she came closer and I could smell the edge strands of her hair. "What do you think about this Kei?"
 
I shrugged, "I don't know, I think we have things to do, reasons we came here in the first place, we came here to be able to leave right?"
 
"Right" Casey said.
 
"Yeah, great" I put a palm over my eyes to rub them and turned around, I was going to walk back to one of the tables to get away from this conversation. I didn't feel Casey's arm on my shoulder, and she didn't say anything to hold me back. Casey...how could this be happening.
 
Casey looked to me with a smile. But I never saw it, I only heard about it.
 
"Do you like her?" Heron was standing beside my seat. His arms were crossed and he looked vindictive. "Do you like Casey, Kei?"
 
"What does it matter to you?"
 
"Well she's looking this way and she looks like she's in pain, so if you like her you should do something about it."
 
"I don't like her" I said, "You do right? So why don't you go and talk to her"
 
"She doesn't like me either" Without asking, Heron sat down beside me. "I thought she was really pretty that last time we met, but she's not interested in me. She's more interested in you, why don't you go and talk to her"
 
I stared at him in disbelief, "We're here to finish the game, to leave it, to get back to the real world" I said, "I don't have time for that kind of stuff"
 
Heron stared me down, "Geez, you're a tough nut, maybe that's why you lost her. No wonder she's been looking at Guizan this whole time. But she's honest, she won't change easily." 
 
What did he mean? Had Casey known that it was Guizan even before yesterday? I tried not to think about it, it was none of my business anyway, who cares what they did anymore.
 
I finished eating up quickly and moved outside to wait for the talks to start. I was sitting on one of the seats looking out at the view when a person I really didn't want to talk to came and sat down beside me.
 
"Hey" Guizan said, "How are you feeling after last night" 
 
"Okay" I said.
 
"I thought about what you told me" Guizan said, "What I'm doing here, where I'm going, you were completely right" He dived straight into the topic, as if there was nothing else to talk about.
 
I didn't want to, but I ended up talking to him. "How about your girlfriend" I said, "I heard you came here to find her, did you find her?"
 
"Where did you hear about that?" Guizan said, after a pause he answered, "You know I only found out about it yesterday, and I hoped it wasn't Casey..."
 
"What do you mean you hoped?" I said, "Did you have preconceptions about it or something?" I was surprised by my own tone, I rarely talked with so much passion, strongly wanting to get something across. "Doesn't it matter whichever girl she it is? Una or Casey, or Elsie, whoever is on your mind"
 
"That's not what I meant and you know that" he said, "It's just unlucky, that's all; I know that you and Casey are close, you're in the same team after all."
 
"Yeah it's unlucky" I said. 
 
"So did you think about it?" he said.
 
"I thought about it, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get back home. The programmer's don't seem to want to talk about much." I was pretty sure the first talks had already started inside, but Guizan and I were here just looking at the sky. If there had been smokes, we surely would be using them.
 
"So are you going to get with her?" I said. I didn't know how close they were in the real world, but if they had come all the way here to look for each other, then surely they would be getting together.
 
Guizan shook his head and smiled, "No, that's not true"
 
"Why not?" I said.
 
"Kei, you know you're really lucky you met me, a guy like me, who is able to protect you guys and try and finish the game for you guys as well"
 
"What are you talking about"
 
"I could never get with Casey" He said, "You and Casey are so close, I don't want to ruin it"
 
That made me feel like an obstacle, someone who was standing in between them, like a bad wizard who needed to be defeated in a kids story. No one wanted to be the bad guy. Guizan and Casey seemed so much better for each other. "Don't mind me" I said, "I've only known her for a short time compared to you."
 
"That's not all of it" Guzian said, "After coming to this world, things change, and people have different ideas about things, our whole environment changed, our friends and ways of life, small day to day habits"
 
"So Casey and I have also changed a lot" he said, "After you know someone for a long time, you will realize this." Guizan looked at me sharply, "It's one of the most painful things to see someone you know as a stranger. Suddenly I feel like Casey is any other person I see on the street. That's what this world has done to our relationship."
 
It wasn't like Guizan was handing Casey out to me on a silver platter, but it was as close to it as it got.
 
"Anyway" I said, "The most important thing to me is to leave this place. That was my goal from when we started"
 
Guizan grinned, "Good, then we can work on that together"
 
There was a knock behind us, then Casey came out. "What are you boys talking about?" she said, "The talks have already started"
 
Guizan grinned at me, "Sure, then I'm going to go and listen to one" His seat was empty in a second. Before I knew it, it was only Casey and me out here.
 
"Are you still upset at me?" Casey said. She was facing down with her eyes looking to me.
 
"No" I said. "I never was"
 
"Yeah right" she smiled, she was testing the waters, and I didn't want to lose my composure. "You were upset right?"
 
"No"
 
"Yes you were" Casey laughed "You were so", 
 
"How is that funny?" I said.
 
"Because it's cute" I couldn't tell why she was amused. She sat down on the seat Guizan left vacant, and was smiling to herself, kicking her legs like a child. 
 
"Hey Kei" she said. "When we leave this place, let's make sure to do it together." I didn't really understand, so she explained, "You know, when we move, we lose the people we are in touch with, I lost so many people I knew, and Guizan, so when we leave, I hope that I can move together with you." She turned her head, "Okay?"
 
"Yeah" I said, "When we leave, we're going to go together"
 
"This world right?" she said, "Not just here, good, then I'm happy" she stood up, "I'm going to go and listen"
 
"Okay"
 
Before the door closed, she poked her head out once more, "Don't forget okay, it's a promise, we're leaving this world together"
 
"It's a promise" I said.

### Chapter Thirty Eight
 
The programmer's were talking about how to find the player who cheated in the game, some of them came up with information that might help us find them.
 
One of the chief programmers was speaking, he spoke slowly and with a slight tinge in his voice, as if he didn't believe what he was saying. "If we want to access background changes, we would usually do so by accessing and sort of command line direction. But being here right now with you guys, in the User Interface, we have no means of access these command lines" 
 
One of the players raised their hand to ask a question. "Would it be possible to find a place that would connect us to the command line? For example someplace in the game that was designed badly, or is exposed?"
 
The chief programmer looked around, then looked back to the questioner, "As of currently we have no reports and evidence of such a portal existing, and even if it did, we wouldn't know how reliable it would be in allowing us to access the administrative levels."
 
Hamish and Elsie were sitting near the front, side by side. He had his arm around her, she was listening intently to everything that was being said. She turned and looked around, as if feeling my gaze, I looked away but I think she still caught me watching her.
 
What was she trying to do in this game? They were calling her the screen hopper, that she just hopped up the ranks by clinging onto strong players. Was that all that she was trying to do this whole time? Had she completely forgotten about us, because the way she was acting said that she had. She hadn't greeted us, and even Richard who had been so excited to see her was thrown aside.
 
"What are you thinking about?" Richard said.
 
"You're awake"
 
"Of course" Richard said, "I'm listening to these lectures, they might tell us a way. Besides I've decided to become an engineer" He looked confident.
 
"Is that after talking to Heron?" I said.
 
"That's a part of it" he said, "But it's also because I really enjoy doing it. After this conference I'm thinking of staying behind and going with Heron." He looked away, "Sorry Kei"
 
"You're leaving us?" I said.
 
"Just for a while" Richard said, "I really want to learn some skills from Heron"
 
"Now the Sparkling Dragons only has two members?" I said, "If you leave, it's just me and Casey left."
 
"You guys will be fine" Richard said, "Besides, the chemistry of our group changed after Elsie left" I had to agree with him, but there was something else itching on my mind. 
 
"How about leaving this game?" I said, "Wasn't that your goal? To get back to the real world?"
 
"Remember?" Richard said, "I was confused in the real world, I couldn't separate it from all the games I had played. I didn't even know it when I was in the real world, so this world is real enough for me."
(Add the part where Richard jokes about himself)
"What about going back" I repeated the same words, before I knew it I had lost my variation.
 
"You should go back" Richard said, "Some people are better suited for this world, some are better suited to that one, in the end they're not that far apart."
 
I gripped my fist, I felt like punching him. "You can't just give up on something so big, how about your family, your parents, your job?"
 
"Do you want to go back to those things?" Richard said. "I can be an engineer here, I can make all sorts of gadgets, Heron's been showing me the possibilities. I could never be an engineer in the 'real' world, I'm not educated and I don't have any skills worth showing. This is already a huge opportunity for me so I want to make the most of it"
 
I never realized how far Richard had gone, he was so focused. He must have been thinking about it for a long time as well. Before I knew it, the Sparkling Dragons that had been set up with such enthusiastic ideas had been reduced to something of the past. When had it disappeared? What happened to it?
 
"You and Casey are good for each other" Richard said. "She thinks it's cute that you like her. It means that she also accepts you Kei"
 
"I don't like her"
 
"When are you going to understand?" Richard said, "It's not about liking or not liking them, it's about working together, that is what a team is isn't it? You are the leader of the Sparkling Dragons"
 
"There's only two of us now"
 
"You're still the leader. So I hope you come and meet me sometime after my skills have improved and I am able to create all sorts of things." Richard looked a bit sad, for a moment, I knew he was going to miss us, and I knew he really enjoyed his time with us.
 
"Contact me Kei" he said, "If you feel like you need someone to talk to, or like something has changed, then contact me"
 
"I will" I said, "Someday"
 
The Programmer's were standing in the front. Now they were talking about the background of the game. Richard slipped out, Heron was waiting for him at the front door with his inventory packed. Heron grinned at me and when Richard arrived, they both left. Richard didn't look back.
 
I sat down in an empty seat near the back to tune in to the conversation.
 
"We were thinking of many ideas when we were trying to make the game" Fermol said. "Every noon we discussed the possibilities. Shoudl we have an area that is dedicated to Player versus player combat, or should the whole map be done this way? Shoudl there be quests in the game that players bond together to accomplish? What if there was a big boss like a huge wizard that was the reason this game existed, and to win you would have to beat the game. But this game is unique among games, because there is no win condition."
 
I couldn't believe it, but the way Fermol was speaking, he almost sounded proud of it, that there was no win condition. My opinion of Fermol changed after it.
 
Or, there was no end.
 
After Fermol's talk, titled "A Brief History of the Human Manipulations of the Current Game System", there was a ten minute break. Most of the players stirred and walked around, but I sat still in the chair.
 
The next talk was by one of the chief programmer's the first five to enter the world. "Following from Fermol's wonderful and very informative talk, I would like to offer my experiences, which are small and insignificant compared to his, but nevertheless, can find importance in our seminar today."
 
"I am Jake" he said, "I was one of the first five programmer's to start making this world back in two thousand and two. As such, I have experiences of standing here and talking about the things that happened to others. But you guys are unique, including myself, we are actually in the game. "
 
Jake used his arms to express himself, "I'm sure most of you are familiar with the motto of this symposium. "To a fish, a fish is the cruelest friend, to a lion, there is nothing more important than a lion; but a fish will still be eaten by a lion, and a lion will eat a fish."  Jake smiled in recollection, "That was written by my colleague, the lead programmer for this world. She was a very inspiring person to work with, I am just hoping that she got to experience this world she created in it's glory before she disappeared."
 
That was right, Aloola was the first and only death in this game. She had disappeared one day before the big glitch. It could have been a simple fault in the system, or a bug that hadn't been found, but the result was that someone's life had vanished. No one had any clue of what happened to her. 
 
Jake continued, "In this world there is the top programmer, and then the top ranked player. They form a large part of what is happening in this world, the political state of it. But I would like to talk about the five programmers who started this game, myself included, and the ideals that helped shape this world."
 
The man turned to us and spoke like it was something he repeated often, "I'm one of the initial programmers, I was the third man to set foot in this world. As they say, one "
 
Yet he had a lower level than I did, he was only level 5, that took about five hours to do. But he was someone who had contribution to the design of this whole game, but he was still struggling to succeed in his own game world, he was doing worse than I was here.
 
I felt a pain, how come he didn't apologize, why did he sound proud of this? What was he doing?
 
"Of course there is no proof that I am one of the programmers" Jake said, "Other than the others vouching for me, but we wrote our names in the credits at the end of the game."
 
He said that his name was in the credits after they beat the game. The only problem was that there were no credits, because there was no way of beating the game. It was an ironic twist.
 
"Aloola was the first one to experience this world, it was the first time in history that anything like this had been done. She spent a few hours in here, we don't know what she did, but later she came out and said that she had been making history here. Then following her, Steve and I entered, I was right behind Steve. We were dumbfounded when we saw this world, it was far beyond any of our expectations, it was too realistic, I found that even a few hours of staying here could be dangerous for our human conceptions of reality."
 
"Steve put a little flag in the ground where we spawned and said an interesting comment in the way Stee usually does, after the famous saying when the first humans explored the moon, "One small step in this world, not a step in the real world. After Steve and I, then Daniel and Warren came through. We formed the first five programmers. But I'm sorry, we never knew that it would turn out like this, Aloola always said that we should form a backup or restore point just in case something happened, but we were progressing too fast and it was too exciting. Everyday we were spending more and more time in this world, our creation." 
 
Jake sighed, "But that was when Aloola fell in love, back in the real world. She stopped coming to meetings, and her time in the world became a minimum. Suddenly our progress wavered. It was urgent as well, because we were bound to go public in a few months time and real players would be entering the world."
 
The audience fell quiet, clearly this was the most interesting talk they had heard. "The thing was, we never knew who Aloola had fell for. Truth be told, we didn't know much about Aloola, 'Aloola' was a screen name, none of us knew her real name. But she said she had fallen in love, and in her way, very selfishly, she started to spend her time desigining an 'expansion' to the current world. What we initially had was a world, and we were all proud of it, but she wanted more, she implemented a level system, and a 'players conquered' tab. She never told us this, but it was because she wanted a competition to start."
 
Jake's expression changed, now he wasn't proud, but in regret. "We should have realized it earlier, but one day Aloola announced what she had done, we were of course shocked, we had been working on something completely different, then she came out and stuck her idea into us. We relented to her and hired a guy from the 'company' to test it out. We gave him a special weapon. So he was 'meant' to win the game. Aloola wanted this as a safety, just in case things didn't go the way she expected them to."
 
I found myself leaning forward to hear it clearer, Jake was explaining everything clearly, why the world was like this.

### Chapter Thirty Nine - A Woman's Greed

"You see, Aloola was still in love this whole time, and her love was an obsession, she couldn't love this person in the real world, so she made a whole world to do so. She was toying with all of us in the end, and we walked straight into it. It made us angry, I felt betrayed, but there was nothing we could do, she didn't care as long as she could live out her love fantasy."
 
"We still don't know who cheated in the game, but not many people knew about the alternative system that Aloola had designed, only the player who we hired, and probably Aloola's lover. Maybe Aloola cheated it herself, or one of the others did, but Aloola designed it without a logout. Deliberately, because she didn't want to leave the world. For her, it was a one way street, and she was never going to look back. The day before she entered this world, she packed her bags at home and left them next to her door. She had never intended to come back."
 
"None of us four know where Aloola has gone, and we don't know who it is that she hired to have the superweapon to test out her world as a failsafe, and we don't know who her lover is. But she designed this world so she could live there one day with her lover whether he wanted to or not, like the most beautiful retirement home. So we know that in a sense, to her, we are all observers of her world. We are just bystanders who watch her love blossom and cheer her on. We are in a concert cheering to her music. By being in this world, that is what we are doing for her."
 
Then Jake chuckled to no one but himself, "And there's no death to help us escape from it"
 
"Although I don't know where Aloola is, from my personal opinion I believe that she will reappear one day, she's related to the Legendary Lime Green Sword somehow, and she's also related to the whole world. Things may or may not be going the way she wants them to right now, but because we are in her world, she is going to have things play out to her advantage. Right now a player called Lahoe is conducting the sword. But eventually, things will change and the possessor of the sword will be her lover. Then maybe Aloola will reappear again. That's the way she designed this world so only the top can be at the top."
 
Jake shook his head, "She's a genius" 
 
"A ruthless genius."
 
Someone raised their hand, after a long pause the audience finally responded. It was a big change, suddenly we were here for a completely different reason, as pawns in this woman's big game. That was what our lives were.
 
"Jake, as one of the initial programmers, do you think that the legendary sword is the only one of the weapons that exists, could there be other superpowers that are hidden and yet to be harnessed? There are so many other extra-combative skills that other players can master. Maybe it would be the same with weapons?"
 
Jake hesitated before answering "I'm not sure, this is only my hypothesis for what Aloola is doing, anything could be possible, but from what I'm seeing, I don't think it's very likely for that to be the case. Because then Aloola would no longer be the strongest and sole possessor of this world. I know that the idea of more legendary weapons is a hot topic right now, but for me it's inconceivable. From the few times I spoke to Aloola, she didn't give any hints of that."
 
For the first time I started to wonder about what Guizan meant when he asked about the most important thing. It wasn't the sword, and it wasn't the romance. It wasn't the levels, so what was it? I also realized that Guizan didn't know the answer, that's why he asked me, and probably a lot of others as well. It was a global scale game of musical chairs that we were all playing, everyone was fighting for the last chair to sit on. Otherwise we were all standing, all the time, never able to sit.
 
Another hand popped up amidst the confusion, "So Jake, Aloola never designed a way of leaving this world, so in a sense, she is prepared to die here, her world is essentially death."
 
That was a grim thought, so we were all dead, and competing amidst the dead. The dead fighting with the dead for a bit more power, and power was just more time to be dead. When had I last seen a person who was alive?
 
Jake answered immediately, "I don't know about the death, but Aloola certainly had her mind set in entering this world and never leaving. Without an audience, it wouldn't be real, so she invited others to attend. For her it's a marriage to behold, for us, it's a funeral we're watching. Going back to leaving this world, I don't think it's possible. Unless there is some bug, or system failure, or loophole in which Aloola overlooked, it would be virtually impossible to leave the game. Remember that this world was Aloola's life's work, she would have made sure that everything was supposed to happen the way it should."
 
Basically, what he was saying was that there was no way out, we were trapped here. 
 
For all eternity. Even if we died, we just respawned at the nearest respawn point, even if we leveled up and became stronger, there was nothing waiting for us, no glory, no accomplishment, only the anticipation of another respawn and repeat.
 
We were like _____ (The Greek figure) pushing the stone up the hill day after day. But in this case, we were walking across a flat plain day after day after day with no change, in a circle.
 
I don't know if I had ever been so afraid, I just wanted someone to comfort me, Casey, Richard, even Guizan. Someone to tell me that I was overthinking it, that it wasn't real. I looked around me, although I was surrounded by people, the same people who would be around me for the rest of my time here, there was no one to comfort me, no one to hug me. 
 
Maybe they all felt the same way as well, there was never going to be any change anymore.

### Chapter Forty - The Strongest Player
 
"He's pessimistic isn't he?" I saw Warren standing in front of me. "Kei, I haven't seen you in a while, since that first day" He was dressed in a suit with white and dark black vertical stripes and looked at home, he was smiling at me.
 
"Hi Warren" I didn't really feel like talking. 
 
"I've been with Jake a lot, but I never took him to be that pessimistic"
 
"So you think there's a way out?" I said.
 
"I don't know, but there's no reason to put it like that so bluntly, now everyone's all depressed"
 
"Well then how else should he put it?" I said, "Should he be kind and generous about it? Should he lie? What do you think?" I turned around to leave, I didn't want to talk to him.
 
"Kei, why are you so upset" he said. But I ignored him and walked off. It was probably the first time in my life that I had ignored someone so directly. But then again, was I even alive here?
 
The room had started to move, players were talking in hushed tones, there was a gathering around Jake and some of the other programmers. I looked around for Casey, I hadn't seen her in a while, and I was sure that only she could comfort me now. We had been together the longest, and she knew me best.
 
I saw Elsie and Hamish out of the corner of my eye, Elsie was smiling and chatting up someone, with Hamish beside her and nodding approvingly. Una was on the side cleaning up some plates that people had  left around. Richard had already left, in a way I wished that I had left with him, then I would never have heard that talk.
 
Where was Casey?
 
Some players I didn't recognize walked in, they looked next to them at the wall and started talking excitedly. Then behind them, Elsie and Hamish came through, as usual, Elsie was surrounded by a bodyguard of players. 
 
As far as I had seen, there were a total of eleven high score ranked players here right now. Hamish, Guizan, and nine others that I saw, but they didn't have that much more of a presence than the usual players, In the end levels were just levels and that was all they were.
 
But here, Hamish was the strongest, and he knew it. As they walked past, one member in the group stopped and stayed in front of me, after the group cleared I saw that it was Hamish. He was standing with a large grin on his face.
 
"Everyone loves to compete" he said. "That's the way men are made, they love to compete"
 
"Is that so?" I only spoke after realizing he was looking for a response.
 
"Everyone here has travelled through the same journey" Hamish's eyes lit up, "Every player here has fought the same battles in different places, they've been surviving. There are even more players than the ones here who fought a lot of smaller battles and failed. They never made it this far." Hamish spread his arms open like the place was his; as if this whole seminar was organized because of him.
 
"But I'm stronger than all of them" Hamish leaned into me, "Do you realize that? I'm the strongest here"
 
There was only one player stronger than him. Only one player who was able to topple him. Hamish repeated my thoughts, "There's only one player who's able to defeat me, if I challenge him, he'll rip me apart and destroy me so hard that there's nothing left."
 
Hamish now stared at me, I saw Elsie watching us from the other side of the room. "Hamish, let's go"
 
"Wait" Hamish said, his eyes never left mine. His voice dropped, "Do you know what his name is?"
 
"The strongest player" I said, "Lahoe"
 
"It's Lahoe" Hamish said, "He's the strongest player in this world. But I'm going to be stronger than him soon. Just you wait and watch. I'm going to own that sword of his."
 
I wondered why he was telling me this. Was it because I felt threatening to him? Or was it because being one of the weakest players here, I reminded him of a feeble weakness?
 
But actually watching Hamish stare me down in the corner of the room, it was like a lion staring at a Chihuahua.
 
Hamish was afraid, that was why.
 
Elsie came over and grabbed Hamish's hand. She looked at me from the corner of her eye, "Don't you see how strong Hamish is? Don't make him waste his time on trash like you" She pulled him with both hands, "Come on, let's go"
 
Hamish stood still, Elsie began to tell me about Hamish, "He's really thoughtful, and he's also determined, a man has to be determined in what he does, that's important. And he also really wants to do good in this world, unlike you, he is really able to do it."
 
She pulled at Hamish once more.
 
But for some reason, as if transfixed, Hamish stayed still in place, the corner of his lips moved slightly, I sensed it, a tremble. It was as if he knew exactly what I was thinking as I stood there. I wasn't impressed by him, but someone else was.
 
"Hamish darling, we have to talk about the succession." Hamish's eyes left mine slowly, by the time he was facing Elsie he was back to normal.
 
"Of course" he said and smiled, "The succession to make me the number one ranked player right? He glanced at me once before finally moving away.
 
I realized that there was something else in Hamish's gaze. It was fear, a fear that the sun was going to shine too bright. Inside him, a glow had developed, something that he was unfamiliar with, but had been curious about for a long time. He was afraid that it wasn't bright enough.
 
But also, that one day it would be quenched.
 
By the strongest player.
 
When I realized it, Elsie was in front of me with her hands crossed. The others were all gathered at one fo the tables in festivity. But Elsie had her hands crossed.
 
"You didn't need to come here" she said. "This seminar is for players who want to change something. Every player here has attacked other players before."
 
"I do want change though" I said, "I want to leave this world, I want to finish this game:
 
"That's the point" Elsie said, "To you it's just another stupid video game that we're in. To everyone else here it's not" Her eyebrows sagged, her chin shriveled up like a sour plum. "To most people here, this is life. This is their new life."
 
"If this is their life, then it's too sad" I looked away.
 
"You always say that kind of thing" Elsie started talking really quickly, I saw a familiarity in it to the day before she left us. "You always talk like it's really easy and it's not worth much because of it. But not everyone can find team members so easily. Hamish took a long time scouting for reliable trustworthy people to climb to the top with him together, so he knows the importance of it"
 
Why was she telling me all of this? What did I have to do with it?
 
"Unlike you" Elsie said, "Hamish wants to become stronger, he wants to be number one"
 
I nodded, "But he's afraid of it"
 
Elsie looked upset, "He's not afraid of it, why do you have to say things like that? Does that make you feel better about yourself?"
 
"Why are you telling me this then?" 
 
"Because you need to listen to it" she said, "Simple as that. This is the oldest place in the game, it was the foundation of the game when it was made, and they swear nothing in it has changed, your name was written in the book for some reason right? I know Guizan showed you, did you know Guizan is actually trying to become an oracle, to predict the future?"
 
I shook my head
 
"I bet you didn't, but that's why he's really playing this game, because he wants to develop new skills that other players don't really know about, the best way to do that is by getting the legendary sword from us"
 
"From us?" 
 
"It's going to be ours soon" she said. "It's just a matter of time"
 
She was talking so much, and her tongue was moving so constantly that I was straining to hear it. I didn't know what this was about anymore. It seemed like whenever I met her, she just kept talking.
 
"Elsie" I said. "Elsie, stop"
 
It took a while for her to stop talking, then she just looked at me blankly. "What?"
 
I smiled, I could tell that she hadn't changed; although the people around her had, Elsie was still the same. "You still haven't attacked any other players have you?" I said. "You were always complaining about not doing so, but you haven't"
 
"That's none of your business" she said. She bit her lip, "Elsie will when she needs to"
 
"Do you know what everyone's calling me?" Elsie said, her eyes were clearer now, "I bet you have, they hear stories of me being a screen hopper. They I just cling onto the strong players."
 
"But aren't you?" I said, "You left us, and joined the strong players, everyone's always telling me about how strong and powerful you are... 
 
"That's why she left Kei" Richard was devastated but he doesn't show it, he doesn't want to become a hindrance to Elsie's life and ambition. He's doing it for Elsie, maybe Kei should do the same"
Very very weak dialogue!!!
Elsie stared at me for a while, her body didn't move at all, only the slight breathing being emitted from her nostrils and filling the air around us. "Kei doesn't know what Elsie thinks, he always interrupts her life. This guy that Elsie knew called "
 
It had started again, she was referring to us in the third person, like this was a story she was narrating. She stared me down, I don't think she even realized she was doing it.
 
Hamish came over and put his hand on Elsie's arm. "Are you okay? You sound a bit confused"
 
She was crazy, and I was fascinated. Listening to her talking in the third person, or talking about her problems, or just talking; I felt a familiarity grow in me. What that familiarity led to was that I realized I missed her. Everything about her being was drilled into me, and now that she was here a puzzle piece had been fit together. It took me this long, and she had to be standing in front of me and talking, for me to realize the presence she had in my life. 
 
"Are you listening?" Elsie said, she had started talking again. I felt like I was the only person that she argued with, and it was because I was the only one who would listen so comfortably. That might have been something that Elsie didn't know. I nodded somberly, her voice suddenly felt so beautiful and rewarding to listen to. 
 
Hamish was looking eager to leave, he had no idea what was happening between us. I felt like our time was up. "Goodbye Elsie" I said. "I will see you later"
 
Elsie stopped mid sentence, she never replied, she just turned around and left with Hamish in her tow. Hamish looked back a few times at me. He eventually came back.
 
"What were you talking about with Elsie? What was she telling you?"
 
"Just about her life" I said. 
 
"Anything I should know?"
 
Hamish must have felt left out that Elsie had been telling me all about her life, although it was really nothing important, but to Hamish it felt like it was important. That's how missing out made things feel. Hamish even sat down on a chair and invited me to sit.
 
"Tell me something about Elsie" he said, "You guys seem really close, and since I'm dating her now I think I need to learn"
 
What if I didn't want to tell him. "What do you like about Elsie?" I said. Hamish was taken off guard.
 
"She is so smart, I say a lot of embarrassing things, and she always corrects me." I nodded for him to continue, "I'm a bit of a douche, and Elsie always has to correct the embarrassing things I say, and I don't mind it, I like it and laugh about it, it's the first time a girl's ever made me feel like that before." 
 
I was surprised at how sincerely he was speaking. But I felt like he was using his sincerity to replace something else that was missing.
 
"Oh yeah...I remember now" he said, "I was in one of the towns, just wandering around, then I saw her next to a fireplace, reading a book in the afternoon, the light was starting to turn orange. I was curious to see what kind of book she was reading. It was one of the books from the library in the shelf. It was the most boring book in there that no one else touched in the whole game's history. I asked her and she said it was a manual to the insects of the game, she said that it had interesting words, and interesting facts, but the plot dragged on at times" Hamish sighed, "I couldn't imagine why anyone would want to read such a boring book, but her studious attitude hit me, I've never even seen an insect, who cares about them, and she was reading about them...to be honest, that was it"
 
"And then you liked her?"
 
Hamish nodded, "Just like that, it's strange isn't it. I don't know if it's just this world, but it was easy, almost too easy."
 
I admired him for liking someone, even if we were in a fake world, I couldn't find myself having the courage to do the same.
 
"Elsie always speaks directly and can be stern, but she does it in a way that doesn't humiliate. She's very hardworking, and loves combat, her skills develop really fast. At the top levels we level extremely quickly, because we know how to, just by defeating one opponent, sometimes we get 50 levels. It's very powerful but can also be scary. Elsie supports me through it, she is only more tempted by the taste of it and started progressing faster than even me."
 
I understood that it was only a matter of time before she started attacking other players, it was inevitable in this world.
 
"I don't know much about you" Hamish said, "But Elsie seems to trust you, that's why she can argue with you. So I'll tell you something cool. Before we came here, we went to meet a player, one of the first programmers to step into this world, he's called Old Man Jenkins."
 
I told him I heard the name before.
 
"Well Old Man Jenkins is one of the wisest players in the game, if not the wisest. We went to him to ask how we coudl defeat the top ranked player..."
 
"Lahoe" I said.
 
"Exactly" Hamish said, "Lahoe never comes to social events, he's too afraid, so we were wondering how we could find him. Jenkins told us that we needed to combine as a team..." Hamish looked at me, "Anyway, what's important is that Elsie is the key piece, she's going to be the one who will take him down. It's a big role to play, and my team have been supporting us so it's going to happen, it's only a matter of time."
 
"Isn't Lahoe invincible?" I said, "Because he's in possession of the legendary sword" If Elsie really did defat him, he might be the first player that she attacked as well.
 
"That's why we need to be very careful, and cunning. But we're not the only ones who're aiming for the sword. Guizan is as well."
 
"Guizan? No, he's just trying to change the ranks around, to help s escape from this game."
 
"Is that what he's been telling you?" Hamish said, "Well that's not the true Guizan at all"

### Chapter Forty One - The Truth

"When a player gets to the top, they become dangerous and unpredictable" Hamish said, "Precisely because of the rule of the legendary sword, it makes one player act as a high and mighty king, determining everything that is to happen. Right now Lahoe is a special case and isn't really using the sword to its full advantage, but if a player were to, it could only mean trouble for the whole world."
 
"But you want to"
 
"We have our plans" Hamish said, "Me and my team, and Elsie. But Guizan is different, don't trust him. He puts on a front, but behind it is something completely different. When a player gets extreme power, they will change"
 
Hamish changed the topic, "Why do you likes Guizan but not me? he said, "I am the same as Guizan, another player, but a more successful one, but I don't have the same greed as he does.I don't want to think of what would happen if Guizan got possession of the sword."
 
I could sense it, Guizan was the same as Hamish, maybe they both wanted power to be able to do something, like get validity, or something like that. But Guizan told me he wanted a wife. 
 
"Elsie is extremely powerful and can take down Lahoe. Supporting Guizan to get the sword is not a good idea, because once someone gets the power you don't know what they will do with it." Hamish said, "Trust me"
 
What was the most important thing that Guizan was talking about?
 
Hamish stood up with his hands against his thighs. "Maybe I was wrong" he said, "Maybe Elsie doesn't have that much to do with you"
 
In other words, he didn't find me very interesting.
 
I went to look for Casey, she hadn't turned up for a while. I wandered to where the programmers were standing, maybe they would have an idea. Fermol, Una, Jake, and another player were standing together discussing something in hushed tones.
 
Una greeted me, then pinched Fermol's arm. He looked up and saw me, then moved out of the circle.
 
"How are you doing Kei, how are the sparkling dragons?"
 
"We're not really together anymore" I said, "Elsie and Richard left"
 
Fermol grinned, "I always thought it was weird that Elsie was with you guys, she didn't seem to fit in, it's probably better for her like this anyway" He looked at me, "I don't mean it was your fault I just mean..."
 
Una came in, "Maybe it's just because it was after that duel on tabletop mountain, and Elsie found out how strong the other players were, perhaps she felt like she wasn't developing enough?" She must have seen me watching, "I'm sorry, Guizan told me everything about you guys, he really likes you Kei"
 
"Is that because I'm not competing with him for the sword?" I said.
 
"Competing for the sword? No, that's not what he's interested in, is that what you thought?"
 
"That's what Hamish thinks" Una didn't deny it, she thought about it, some other people would have attacked me. That was what I found to make Una unique. "Hmm, maybe it's because Hamish wants to gather postive reinforcement for himself. Or else he could just be paranoid, so paranoid that he has to take Elsie from you as well."
 
"Why would he be paranoid about me?"
 
"I don't know" Una said, "But Guizan seems to see something in you, so maybe Hamish sees it as well. Maybe it's something only high level players can see"
 
"I'm not sure" Fermol said, "But I think Guizan secretly wants to be an oracle"
 
"A What!?" Una said. "Why an oracle?"
 
"It's a separate class set" Fermol said, "Guizan was telling me about it a couple of weeks ago, he was really enthusiastic, and now has stopped talking about it, maybe to hide it"
 
"Or...because he realized that's a really bad decision?" Una said. "Who would do that"
 
"I don't know" I said, "I don't know what the truth is about him, everyone seems to have different ideas, but I hope that he turns out to be the Guizan I know." 
 
"Did you know?" Una said, "Kei, the only reason the Sparkling dragons, or you Richard and Casey ever got in here was because of Guizan."
 
"What do you mean?"
 
"Three days ago when you arrived and I was hostie, I went to ask the officials if we could let you in, and they said no, they didn't want outside players to listen. It's a really closed off system they have here, I don't think it's very good either. But then Guizan heard it, he stood up and told them to let you in, that he highly recommended it, and if anything went wrong, he would personally take responsibility for it."
 
Una point her finger at me, "So you have to make sure that you don't leak any information to the outside"
 
I never realized Guizan had stood up for us, so far every bit of help that had come toward us was because of him.
 
"The point is," Fermol said, "The top players all want to become the best, so they all try to become stronger and stronger so that they can forget about being weak, that's really all this game is about." Fermol was a level 13 player commenting on the philosophy of the game. Una and I looked at each other and laughed a bit. It was kinda funny.
 
Una said, "Guizan ignores the others, he isn't interested in them, he only focuses on you Kei, and nurtures you like you are his personal child. Even I don't feel as close to him"
 
What if Elsie had picked up on this and commented on it, maybe that's why she disliked Guizan. Friendship also meant that somewhere else, ties were broken. There are only so many friends one can have.
 
Una, Fermol and I had bonded talking about Guizan and other players. I felt like we were at the bottom in this hierarchy, and we were the outsiders commenting on the inside. Otherwise, we didn't have much importance. I decided that this place wasn't for me. From the moment we arrived, The sparkling dragons, or Richard, Casey and I, had not really fit in here, the others were all a big group together.
 
"Have you seen Guizan?" I asked Una. "I need to ask him some questions"
 
"About what? Do you also want to climb to the top?"
 
"No" I said, "I want to leave, I always have from the moment I set foot in this place. I am trying to find a way to get back home."
 
"Are you serious?" Una said, "Didn't you hear the lectures? Half of the programmers are saying it's impossible"
 
I shook my head, "I think it's possible, I just need to find a way"
 
"And you think Guizan knows how?" Fermol said. "If he knew, he would already be out of here. Most of the players would be gone"
 
We stood in silence, then Una sighed, "Fine, follow me, I think he's talking to one of the other programmers, you can go ask him yourself."
 
I was starting to feel like leaving this seminar, I felt like I had taken all I could from it, and I wasn't able to give it anything.
 
Una led me into the kitchen, there was food placed everywhere, and the smell fo freshly cut vegetables. Everything was spick and span, reflecting cubic shards of light. As we walked past one of the chefs, he stared at me, I gave him a smile but he didn't respond. Then he looked at Una.
 
When we got through the doorway I heard him call out "Una, can you come here"
 
Una rolled her eyes and gave me an apologetic look "Just give me a minute"
 
Soon I started to hear shouting. Then the chef came out and shouted at me, "You can't just walk through the kitchen" 
 
"I'm sorry" I said, "I didn't realize"
 
He turned to Una, "You have to stop allowing customers through" Una held a defiant look. "I'm the chef so you need to ask me about anything in the kitchen"
 
I could see that Una also had a hard time at this job. This chef probably had a high cooking skill level, Una didn't have one. There was more hierarchy here.
 
"I was just taking Kei to see..."
 
The chef's expression suddenly changed, he looked horrified and covered his mouth, "Kei? As in the king?" He looked at me then eyed me up and down. "You're Kei?"
 
What was this all about? I gave him a nod.
 
"I'm really sorry about this" he showed his hand around the room, "This is not your fault really, and I never should have said anything. I hope you understand"
 
"No problem" I said.
 
"Come" Una grabbed my hand and led me out of the kitchen. Once we were back in the corridor she explained, "That's also to do with Guizan" she said, "All of the high ranked players know about you and that dreaded story because he's told everyone"
 
"Silly" she said, "He respects you"
 
"Everyone knows about that story?" No one had shown me any hint of knowing it before, Elsie probably also knew about it. Maybe that was why everyone was so unreasonably jealous. Maybe that was why people were scared, but also garnered respect.
 
Una walked quietly along, until another doorway led to the entrance. We were in the staff quarters, the walls had red carpet on them until they were cut off by a horizontal decoration of plain wood which ran throughout the corridor.
 
"He should be over there" Una pointed. I saw that she was also eager to meet Guizan, talking about being in a relationship, the two of them were close.
 
I opened the door and immediately heard it before I saw it.
 
Guzian looked to us, he was leaning against the wall, I saw movement in front of him covered by his arms.  "What is it?" she said, then looked to us as well.
 
It was Casey, the two of them had been making out, right in front of the entrance, players were walking right past them the whole time.
 
Guizan slowly let go and moved back. Casey came out of his grip and rustled her hair to put it back in order. "We're just having a bit of fun" he said.
 
"I can see that" Una grinned at me and laughed "Look what they're doing"
 
I didn't see how it was funny, was this normal in her life? That was her boyfriend right?
 
"Oh" Casey looked up, "Kei, you're here as well" There were still kiss marks over her lips and neck, the top button of her blouse was undone.
 
I turned around and walked out.
 
---

### Chapter Forty Two - Departure
 
I wished I hadn't gone to look for Casey, or Guizan, I wished I had never seen that. I walked away from the scene as fast as possible
 
But another part of me was saying that they used to be boyfriend and girlfriend, and Guizan came here for the sole reason of looking for her.
 
"Kei" Casey called out behind me, she was running to catch up. I just sped up my pace, I didn't want to face her, I didn't want to hear what she had to say.
 
"Kei, that's all we did, no more"
 
"You were making out with Guizan" I said. I noticed her eyes, they weren't the normal eyes she had, they looked like they were in pain
 
"He was my boyfriend" Casey said, "We agreed to just do it during the day, and only kissing"
 
"So you did it more than once?"
 
"Just yesterday and today" Casey said, "Honest, I swear. I like you Kei, we're a team remember? We're going to leave here together." She grasped my arm, "I was just saying goodbye to him"
 
"That was saying goodbye?" Then I chuckled, "Why don't we say goodbye as well"
 
Casey looked distressed, "No, Kei, that's not...I don't want to leave you, we need to go together"
 
The way it was turning out, I would be leaving here alone. In the end the sparkling dragons had dissipated the way the water in a pot fizzles up into the air.
 
"I'm leaving" I said, "I don't want to stay here anymore"
 
"Casey sat down on the ground, she forced a smile, "Mom always told me not to play games, I should have listened to her. Who knew that it would come down to this. I don't want to be here anymore. I want to go home."
 
"I don't think that even your Mom would have had this in mind when she told you not to play games" I said.
 
Casey breathed out, "Even when I'm crying, you can still joke around, aren't you hilarious"
 
"Why don't you just go with Guizan" I was starting to feel sorry for her, Guizan and Una were talking in back in the entrance. I just couldn't get it out of my mind that Guizan and Casey had been snogging each other, making sounds and licking each other while in plain sight of the other players walking into the lobby. That was why I hadn't seen the either of them in a while.
I couldn't get the picture of Casey with her leg hitched up and Guizan gripping it out of my mind. I shook my head. 
 
"I don't like Guizan" she said, "I like you, Kei, I've always liked you"
 
"Then why are you snogging him?" 
 
Casey just started crying again. "He used to be my boyfriend, we were just kissing for a bit"
 
I shook my head and walked out. But casey came running after me again. When she touched me I felt dreadful, she was so warm, so close, so caring. Why did she have to go and do that?
 
"Kei" she whispered, "Please, I want to go with you"
 
"The sparkling dragons doesn't exist anymore" I said, "Richard and Elsie both left, it turns out I wasn't able to do anything, so you should leave as well, staying with me won't get you anywhere"
 
Casey let go and fell to the ground. Her knees and palms were on the floor. "If you have to go, then please don't forget about me" she said. Then she looked up, there were tears through her eyes and hair, her nose was running, everything was coming out of her.
 
"I won't forget about you" I said.
 
I turned the corner with thoughts of Casey running through my mind, I had never in my wildest dreams imagined something like that. 
 
"Kei" I recognized the voice.
 
"What do you want Guizan? You here to brag that you won her over?" I wondered if Una had been upset at him, or whether she found the whole thing to be funny. The two hadn't heard the talk because they were too busy making out.
 
I didn't care anyway. I was done here, there was nothing more to be done. Although I had never done anything in the first place.
 
"Sit down" Guizan was beside me, he ordered me to sit. 
 
I did, I don't know why I was listening to him, but his voice was compelling. I also wished that it wasn't true, that he would tell me that it was all a mistake.
 
"I was making out with Casey so I didn't hear the lecture" Guizan said.
 
He was starting out with that? How insensitive was he?
 
"I'm glad you made it though" he said. "This might be the last time we see each other, so if you;re leaving, I think we should say goodbye properly."
 
I looked at him, why was this the last time? What did he mean? Was he going somewhere?
 
"Remember I told you that I was going to try to revert the game by making everyone level 1? Then we would be able to log out?"
 
It seemed like so long ago. "Yeah" I said.
 
"It's not far off now" Guizan said, "It's actually happening, once I get the legendary sword, I will be powerful enough to control the game and do so"
 
"You're just going to control everyone" I said.
 
"No I'm not" Guizan said, "Why would you say that, no, who told you that?"
"Never mind" I shrugged it off. I knew Guizan was powerful, I had witnessed his power at the tabletop mountain duel, he defeated a player who's ranking was higher than his, a fight he should have lost. He had used some super power weapon that no one knew about. He was very powerful. But now I just hoped, I really hoped that he wouldn't be the one in possession of the legendary sword. 
 
I looked up at Guizan, "Good for you" I said. "You're going to free al of us, you're going to be our savior"
 
"You don't sound very happy" he said, "Casey wasn't yours you know, she was just traveling with you, don't get the wrong idea. I'm trying hard to help everyone out, but all you can see is Casey, I've even showed you the history and how important it is but you don't seem to care, you just want to go back. So now I'm doing that for you and you're still not satisfied." He speaking sounded like spitting, "What are you, a woman?"
 
"What are you then? Did I ever ask for your help?" 
 
"Where would you be without my help? Guizan said, "You'd be in the spawning farm as fodder for all of those other players, and you'd be wishing for help"
 
"Go away" I said "I hope I never see you again, I hope your plan works."
 
"Aren't you leaving with Casey?" Guizan sighed. "She's waiting for you"
 
I ignored him and walked out of those front doors. The ones I had seen so long ago. Who cared about Casey.
 
---

### Chapter Forty Three
 
After walking for an hour I couldn't stop thinking about Casey. the two of them were probably making out right now. I kicked a tuft of sand and it scattered in the air, as if my boot had released it from the ground. Ahead of me the sand dunes were never-ending, and behind me I saw the shrunked image of the villa. We went in there with great expectations, now I was by myself, the others had left, driven away by me ultimately.
 
As I kept walking, I started to get tired and pulled out some snacks from my inventory. Right about now, Casey would say something, and Richard would laugh about it. Elsie would tell us to hurry up so we could carry on and level up faster.
 
I missed it.
 
Now I didn't know where I was going, how was I going to leave this world, most likely it wasn't even possible. In the end, the only hope was in Guizan, that he would free us from the chains of this place. that was if he was truthful about it.
 
Even after a few hours the sand dunes didn't subside. I wondered just how many there were. Behind me, were my footsteps that trailed off over hills and hills of dunes. Like a brown ocean frozen in time.
 
In front of me, a player was approaching, he had a headband wrapped around his head and walked like he was used to it. He was using the same path I was, which meant that he would walk past me.
 
I had no idea what level he was, and since I didn't have a team, there was not as much safety. 
 
But it was the same for him. He walked closer and recognized me, his observation skill was lower, so he was probably a lower level than I was. He noticed it as well, but he started running towards me.
 
I wielded my bow and put some arrows in my quiver, just in case. But it didn't scare him off, he kept running closer. 
 
"Stop there" I said.
 
He stopped, then he looked at me. I recognized him, he had long blonde hair. His player name was Sheila. 
 
It was the player Guizan dueled with and defeated at the summit of tabletop mountain. Sheila had been one of the strongest players, now he was a mere level 16.
 
He didn't recognize me though, "Did you come from the Programmer's Seminar?" he said.
 
"Yeah" I said. "I just left it a few hours ago"
 
"Good" Sheila said, "For some reasons it's taken me a while to get here." He squinted, "Who are you? I don't recognize you"
 
"I'm not important player"
 
"Yes you are" Sheila said, "If you're from the Programmer's meeting, then you are"
 
"No, I'm really not" I said.
 
"Do you know Guizan?" he said.
 
From his look, I knew what he had in mind. A cold revenge.
 
"You know him right? And you know who I am" Sheila smiled. "He's going down, whoever you are I want you to know that, wait around at the closest spawning point, you'll meet him again"
 
I found myself supporting Guizan. "He's trying to help all of the players leave this world" I said, "He's doing good" I was surprised at my own response, didn't I dislike him?
 
"That's not a help" Sheila said, "It'd be better if we could eliminate him completely but he's stronger than we expect, he's mastered extremely high level skills. I underestimated him, I never should have..." Sheila paused, "You don't want me to go to the seminar do you? You want me to stay here"
 
"I want to leave this world" I said, "Thats what I want"
 
Sheila came closer to me, "Forget about that world" he said, "This world is so much better. I was a nobody back in that world, I was working all day trying to make enough money just to survive. Then the rich folks would come around and laugh at me. Look at this world, isn't it beautiful? And everyone is born equal, everyone is given the same chances in life"
 
"But this world is missing one thing extremely important" Sheila looked at me. "Death" I said. "That's what's missing"
 
"You're a strange fellow" he said, "Is that why you're leaving early all alone, and walking at that, how about flying"
 
"I'm not high enough level for that"
 
"I know guys like you" Sheila said, "Whenever I meet a guy like you I say they should go talk to Old Man Jenkins"
 
"The chief programmer?"
 
"Yeah, he's got a lot to offer" Sheila said. "If you want to leave the game, you really need to talk to him, he's like the psychologist of this place. He'll straighten you right out."
 
I was curious now, everyone mentioned this player and I had nothing to do, nowhere to go, "Where is he?"
 
"You're interested? Good, go East from here, to a small town. Jenkins designed it himself so he could live there. That was his intention from the start, forward thinker eh? But now we all know where he is, he lives 20 miles East to a small town called Rjukan. It's in the middle of a huge glacially carved U-shaped valley. Because the mountainsides are so steep, the locals installed a big mirror to reflect the sunlight to the very bottom, otherwise they would never see it."
It sounded like a jungle gym.
 
Old Man Jenkins. A name I had kept hearing a lot. A lot of the programmers talked of him with high spirits and great respect, and they recommended me to go meet him.
 
"Okay" I relented. "I'll go"
 
"You're a good guy" Sheila said, "I'll be your friend when you come back with your mind changed" He circled his head with his index finger, "He'll sort you out, he's a bit mental himself"
 
It was decided then, I was heading out to Rjukan. It sounded like a bewildering place but I was looking forward to it.
 
---

### Chapter Forty Four
 
I took the first turnoff to the left as I was instructed. Sheila's map was crumbling in my hands. The sand particles were biting into it. Before my hands were empty, I turned to face ahead. there were sword-like mountains poking into the air. 
 
Ahead was completely different terrain, in the map on my screen it was defined as the entrance to a new section. "Fiordland" The Programmer's meeting was held in the "Ghibli". After an hour, I saw the first trickle of water, another thirty minutes later the surroundings changed drastically. I found myself progressing uphill and there were more and more trees. Before I knew it, I had come into a temperate rainforest.
 
 The sword mountains were beginning to form around me, with each step the earth became more jagged and rocky, and trees grew ever more desperately, and my steps started to wear and tear.
 
I was walking on a path before I knew it. I had waited for one to form. It was made of rocks and leaves that had been put in place by the wind and movement of the earth. There was a small sign that hung with the words 'Rjukan' written down. The sign looked older than the trees around it, as if it had been decorated beforehand to look that way. 
 
I rubbed my hands together, this might be the last time I saw it. I never knew what was going to happen now. My hands were wet, sogging from wiping away the tears that I fought to contain. Now that I had no one around me, and I was walking for days alone, my inner feelings started to surface, but why was it crying?
 
I sat down on the path and let the leaves brush my back, with my hands spread out wide, it almost felt like I was in the real world. 
 
This must have been how all the others felt. They didn't think about the real world anymore. I smiled in a bittersweet moment, I felt closer to them somehow.
 
As I let my legs rest, a player walked past me. I always watched other players, they might be able to destroy me, my level wasn't that high compared to a lot of other players, I knew that now. 
 
But this player seemed to be in a rush, he was wearing a long hood and boots as high as his knees, he dragged a big cart behind him through the mud, he walked fast enough to show that he knew the track, very well. He barely looked up as he went past me.
 
He obviously wasn't phased by other players.
 
I wondered where he was going in such a hurry, no one in this world was really in such a hurry. The back of his cart disappeared around one of the corners I turned earlier.
 
I decided to continue, there were a lot of things about this game that I didn't know.
 
Another sign appeared, now I was walking in the middle of a magnificent rainforest shaded a deep green. The sign was hanging on some browned vines. It said, "Rjukan" once more, in the same faded and uninviting etching.
 
The trees cleared and a few houses appeared, a large ray of sunlight hit the village from the side where a mirror was balanced on the side of a mountain. 
 
A mirror to show the most largest person in the world that they were the most beautiful. A narrow bridge grew over a creek. I crossed it and saw a few people walking past.
 
"Do you know where Old Man Jenkins is?" I said.
 
One man smiled and pointed up the valley. "Up there, he lives in the cirque of the glacier"
 
I said my thanks and progressed further up. The players who lived here didn't give off any hostility, it wasn't the first time I felt this, it was the same feeling of disregard that had permeated the respawn areas.
 
This was a village of retirement. In one of the corners of the map. A small house stood on the edge of the cliff at the very top. It was made of modern panels with an elegant drainage system. There was a mailbox, and I could see a huge panel of windows looking out into the wind on the other side of the house.
 
I wasn't sure why there was a mailbox, but the name was right.
 
"Old Man Jenkin's No Ads Accepted"
 
Who would be posting ads in a place like this, ads for what? Much less calling himself an old man on the entrance.
 
I peeled open the gate and stepped in, a piece of paper hung on the door.
 
Gone out guys, will be back in a few days.
 
            the Old Man
 
So I had missed him. 
 
"If you're looking for Old Man Jenkin's he's gone to the meeting" A voice behind me said. I turned and saw a girl about Casey's age, she was holding a basket of goods, it looked like mushrooms gathered from the forest. "They've asked him every time, now he's finally decided give them a hard time himself."
 
Her name was Laura, she seemed to know Jenkin's well. "What skill are you training?" I said. 
 
"Me? My cooking skill" she said, "Do you want to try some later? I'm making a big hotpot."
 
"I'm okay" I said. "I have to wait for Jenkin's return." I had also gone to the programming meeting, so I should have ran into him.
 
"He was probably fishing on the side" Laura said, "He does that a lot"
 
I told her that the only person I had come across was a man rushing the other way with a cart. Laura's eyes lit up, "That's him" she said, "He had the cart to carry all of the fish he was going to get"
 
So that man I saw for a brief moment had been Old Man Jenkins. 
 
I looked at Laura curiously, "How come you're living all the way out here?"
 
"I like it here, it's away from all the drama in the towns" she said.
 
"Don't you want to go back?"
 
"No" she said, "I don't enjoy all of the small talk they do, it's more calm here, and on the occasion of visitors I cook for them...."
 
"No" I said, "I didn't mean the respawn areas, I meant back to the real world"
 
"Oh" Laura smiled, "Sure I would like to, I never really thought about it much, I didn't think it was possible."
 
It had long been out of her mind, the thought of returning.
 
Laura put her basket of mushrooms down. "It's Kei, right? Do you want to go to the graveyard with me?" I must have looked confused, because she grabbed my hand, "I promise you will like it" she smiled.
 
She led the way, she was more relaxed than Casey was, also more talkative. She reminded me of her, and they were both trying to be cooks.
 
Laura led me around a few slopes to an open hill higher than Rjukan was. The mirror's sunlight didn't hit here. In the distance, Jenkin's house looked small and meager.
 
A small wooden gate separated the respawn area here. It had about fifty graves in it.
 
"Look here" Laura pointed, "That's my one" Sure enough a grey block of stone had Laura's name carved into it. She had been attacked by another player and respawned here.
 
"It feels like a while ago now, and there's Old Man Jenkin's" She led me to another grave that had all sorts of words written on it.
 
"He always tells me that the only things you can carry on to the next world are words" she said, "That's why he writes all of this down on his grave"
 
It was filled with notes and notes of things, I didn't understand half of it. 
 
"Jenkin's was attacked and lost?"
 
"Oh he's attacked all the time" Laura said. "Because he's so famous you see, everyone wants to say that they've destroyed him. Even just a little bit."
 
I nodded. Even here in the middle of nowhere players were still coming out to attack him.
 
"You're rare though" Laura said, "Most of the players respawn in here and walk out to get back to where they were. This is the closest respawn area from quite far away. The path you came through is mostly taken the opposite way." She sat down on one of the graves. "But a few other players also came all the way here to look for Old Man Jenkin's, one of them is really famous now"
 
"Who?" I said.
 
"He died here about three or four times, before he left though, he removed the graves so you might not believe me. He's the first ranked player now, Lahoe" 
 
I looked around, Lahoe also had graves here?
 
"He came all the way to find Jenkins" she said, "I don't know what they talked about, but they were excited a lot. Both of them"
 
"Recently also, the second ranked player came here with a girl"
 
I stiffened, "Hamish and Elsie?"
 
"Yes" Laura smiled, "They came to ask about something, Jenkins told me that they were trying to defeat Lahoe. The guy was cocky about it, but the girl was really polite and a pleasure to be around. I hope they make it to the top, they deserve it more than that other guy who's there now."
I couldn't imagine Hamish and Elsie also standing here. Maybe they had also looked at the graves. I looked over them with a fondness. It was a piece of history, there were all sorts of them with diffferent messages written across. 
 
Then one of them caught my eye. It was growing in the corner, next to the wooden sticks.
 
"Whose is this one?" It had two words written on it. 
 
I'm watching
 
"Ah, her" Laura said, "It belongs to Aloola, the chief programmer. You know her right? The first person to set foot in this world." She crossed her arms, "Jenkins says she had a wicked sense of humor, apart from never listening to them, she made this grave before she disappeared. There is no history in this world, no stories to follow or cultures to understand, we are all the pioneers. Aloola felt that and wanted to change it." She grinned, "At least that's what Jenkins said"
 
Laura walked me back to the exit. "That's why I wanted to show you this" her tone had deepened, "Every now and then, players like you come along and ask me why I live here, why I don't leave for somewhere better, when they say those things, I show them this" she swept her arms around. "There's so much happening here, it seems so alive you know? So I think that maybe it's real too"
 
"Anyway" Laura smiled at me, "Come back, try some of the hotpot I'm making. The old man will turn up eventually, He has such a bad sense of time, he left for the meeting a week late."
 
There were depths to Laura that I didn't see.
 
Laura cooked a delicious meal, it was hotpot with an assortment of vegetables. She poured a bowl of sugar in "There's no diabetes in this world" she said with a smile. After we were both full, she told me about old man Jenkins, he received a flyer saying that if he didn't attend and support the programmer's meeting, it was equivalent to saying "no" to change in the game. Some of the top players could be pretty pushy.
 
"Have you ever been to one of those meetings?"
 
"No" Laura said, "From what I've heard of them from Jenkins, I don't want to go either."
 
"What has he been saying?"
 
"You'll see. Do you want some tea?" She was holding a teapot. 
 
As I drank the tea, I thought of Old Man Jenkins walking across the sand dunes that I had also come across, what was he thinking to himself? What did they want to talk with him about?
 
A while later, Laura had showered, I was surprised by how domesticated her house was. She gave me a place to stay, then pointed out that she was going to sleep early because she had work tomorrow.
 
Work tomorrow? What kind of world was this? It felt just like we were at home.
 
"Go and check Jenkin's house again" she said, he might be there.
 
I left to check on him again, the sun was sinking and making the trees turn a pale yellow. I knocked on his door but there was no answer. Even if he could return fast, there was no way he would return that fast.  Unless there was a special technology to those means.
 
When I got back to Laura's place the lights were off and she was asleep. I sneaked in quietly and sat on the sofa, finding myself fall asleep. There was nothing else to do.
 
Then the next morning Laura accompanied me to go and check once more. She said that he should be back. But on his door was the same note, weathered a bit from last night, but the same nevertheless.
 
As we turned to leave though, we heard talking getting louder. A man came forward and swung open the gate.
 
No doubt it was Old Man Jenkins, I recognized him from earlier, he truly did look old, but he had a charismatic air about him that kept people close.
 
"Were you talking to yourself?" Laura grinned with the basket she was holding tilted against her hip. 
 
"I have these two newcomers, they're going to live here with us"
 
Old Man Jenkins turned around and waved, then with a splutter of footsteps two faces I recognized joined behind Jenkins.
 
"Warren, Israel!" I said.
 
Old Man Jenkins looked at me, "You must be Kei"
 
"Yes" I said. 
 
"Everyone was talking about you there, especially Guizan, he was as secretive as he always is. So I take it you've come to visit me?"
 
"Yes, I wanted to ask about..."
 
"Uhh" He held his hand up, "Let's get these two sorted first, it was good of you to come and visit me while I was away, come back again in a few hours."
 
Laura took me away. 
 
"There's an ancient Chinese story of a prince going to visit a wise teacher's house not once, not twice, but three times before the teacher finally opened his door to welcome him. Then they worked together to make a kingdom." She put her basket down. "Jenkins is just like that, so count yourself lucky to have met him. So respect him like they respected teachers back in the story"

### Chapter Forty Five

As promised, I went to meet Old Man Jenkins a few hours later. He greeted me like I was his best friend, or as if he had known me for a long time. I wasn't sure if he treated everyone that way, but it was a wonderful feeling.

He said he had put the other two to sleep. The way he said it, Warren and Israel seemed so immature and in need of attention.

I wondered if I seemed that way in front of him as well.

"So what have you come all the way here to ask me about?" Jenkins stood at his kitchen chopping up some vegetables. "I'm making curry rice, so stay for dinner, I believe Warren and Israel would love to have some too."

I agreed and jumped straight into what was on my mind. I didn't even realize it until now, but I sounded adamant. Perhaps it was the only thing that I had made a decision on in this world.

"I want to leave this world" I said.

Old Man Jenkins smiled and indicated for me to pass the salt. "If you said that anywhere else, people would be sending you mental help"

A bit later he became serious, "You realize you're not the first one to come to me with that ambition" he chopped up some spring onion and shook a tuft of salt on it.

"I realize that, but you were one of the chief programmer's right? I thought you might have an answer, and everyone was directing me to you" I couldn't tell him that he was my last hope, if he didn't know how then I really didn't know what to do.

Old Man Jenkins gave me some of the spring onion to try, it tasted absolutely amazing. "It's good right?" he said.

I nodded. "So what did you tell the other person who asked you this question?"

"I think you may know a few of them" he said, "Some of them are players who just came wandering in here similar to yourself, others are now famous players. There's no confidentiality laws here, one was Lahoe"

"Lahoe, the top ranked player asked you how to leave?"

People can be surprising how much they are willing to accept, and why they are doing the things they do" Jenkins said. "Another player who asked me came with their friend. I'm sure you know them, Elsie, she was with Hamish. I heard that she's a very strong player now, maybe even surpassing Hamish in strength." He looked to me as I said it, perhaps he wanted a reaction.

"Elsie asked you how to leave the game?" I never would have imagined her to do so, she seemed to be wanting the exact opposite. She and I had the same goals...

"She also wants to leave" Jenkins said, "A lot of players do, but some are too afraid to do so, others have forgotten, and some are lazy, there are all sorts of reasons"

"How about you?" I said.

Jenkins smiled, "I just love it here" he offered me another bud of spring onions. "But it's been so long that I wouldn't mind going either"

"So how do I do it?" I said.

"Truth is" Jenkins said, "I give a different answer to everyone who is asking me. I don't know, that's the truth. Do you think you could start to enjoy living here?"

A deep part of me felt a strong fear and aversion. If this man didn't know the truth, then who did? Maybe it was impossible, maybe I was dreaming, everyone else had already given up, it was just me prowling around and trying to leave.

"Elsie learnt about leaving" Jenkins said, "I told her that I didn't think we could leave, then she started to climb the ranks, maybe to search for something there." Jenkins held no expression as he spoke, "Lahoe didn't know either, he even let himself get attacked and respawn back here a few times because he didn't believe me."

"And I can bet you that the other players all want to leave, but for most of them it's just too painful to think about."

I remembered back at the programmer's meeting, what the other chief programmer, Jake, had been talking about. That Aloola had designed this whole world, it was just something of her liking, we were unimportant in it.

"Walk this way, walk this way" I heard Jenkins guiding Warren and Israel behind him. They both saw me and greeted me warmly.

"We remember you" Israel said, "You were there when the first part of the game system failed"

"How's it going?" Warren said.
"We were just having a discussion" Jenkins put soup bowls in front of us and poured some warm green soup into them.

"Yeah, you were wanting to leave right?" Warren said, "I'm thinking of doing so as well, so maybe we can go together"

"The trouble is" Israel said, "No one knows how to"

Jenkins sat down and crouched over his soup "Well it's been so long, but we still managed to meet. I'm glad"

Warren and Israel went to sleep early, making me promise to take them if I ever found a way out. They said it would be a miracle.

"I'll tell you what" Jenkins said. "There's going to be another programmer's meeting organized, they're calling it the third meeting of the suns. I'll ask them about it there."

I felt the emotions leaving my face, my cheeks and my nose. Was there really no answer? Even for this man?

"They'll be meeting here tomorrow night" he said, "We will come to a conclusion"

"What do you mean you will come to a conclusion, you don't actually care for anything that is going to happen right? You're just sitting here sipping your tea"" 

Jenkins looked over to me. "I do care" he said, "But it's a question that before people were asking me about it, I was asking others." He sighed and put his cup down, the tea started sinking to the bottom. "I was asking others about what we could do, none of the players knew, the players who I thought would know about it were clueless, so I eventually stopped asking the questions. I left it to myself, in here" he nudged his heart. 

"Anyway" he said, "Tomorrow, I was going to take you to see my best friend, you Warren and Israel together, how does that sound."

It sounded like he was treating me like a kid, but there was nothing else I could do, really nothing else at all.

"Okay" I said. "That sounds great"

The next day we set out with Old Man Jenkins walking in the lead. Warren and Israel followed behind me, they didn't talk at all. I don't know why, but outside of their comfort zones, they were quiet, like they didn't know what to do, they were even following me around. Me, who had no idea what was happening.

Warren only turned to look back at us every few minutes, he kept a fast pace, and when he finally slowed it was only to inspect a mushroom he had found growing. 

"It's beautiful isn't it?" he said.

He picked it up and gave it to Warren, who looked delighted to find it. "There you go" he said.

When I caught up to him, he told me why the third meeting of the suns was being organized, it was to discuss the question of authorization. The next player who would inherit the sword. Jenkins said the programmers held great vision in changing the world, it was like an election where they all voted to support one player, or a group of players to obtain the sword and conquer the whole map.

Politics never escaped human fate. No matter how far we had come..

"It's Elsie and Hamish" he said, "They're going to find Lahoe and defeat him"

"Do you think they can?" I said.

"I don't know, but the fight is going to be nearby, so whoever loses will respawn back near where my best friend lives." 

"Was this all planned?" I said.

"Maybe" Jenkins found another mushroom and gave it to Warren. "Anyway, whatever is going to happen will happen tomorrow"

"Okay" I nodded.

### Chapter Forty Six

I started to think about Casey and Richard as we were walking, I don't know what warren and Israel were thinking, they didn't have much presence at all. I had absolutely no idea what was on Old Man Jenkin's mind.

I saw Richard leaving with Heron, I never properly said bye to him, he just kind of left. And Casey neither, it still hurt me to think of her, seeing her with one of my friends...like that. I never said bye to neither of them. It would have been better if we left together and there was a side street, a normal side street at one of the villages, and I would have been there and said farewell to them properly. Casey going off one way, and Richard to the other. For some reason that felt the most natural, leaving.

Before long, Jenkins led us around a few trees and we came into a clearing next to a fast flowing river.

Jenkins called out in a loud voice. "Ooooi, we're here guys!" Warren and Israel ran past me, Warren turned to me as he passed and looked at me briefly. He looked excited and tired.

Jenkins announced that we were to have lunch here. Warren and Israel promptly brought out their sandwiches, as if a switch had been pressed for them to do so.

As we were eating, Jenkins Skimmed a rock in the water, he crouched down and threw it, it jumped a few times before disappearing. "Look" he said, "The water drifts, whether or not the rock skims across it. All around us the water is drifting" He threw a rock on the other side, "It drifts, throw it somewhere else and that part of the water also drifts in the same way. It doesn't matter, it all drifts."

"Your point?" Israel said. She had half the sandwich in her mouth, and was crunching down on it. Warren let one hand loose free from his sandwich and hit Israel with his free hand. He tried to get her to stop speaking to Old Man Jenkins in that way.

Old Man Jenkins just stared into the water. 

"Let me tell you a story I heard" he said.

Warren kneeled down in front of him, Israel did the same after a bit of a pause. 

"There was a man I knew who spent his whole life fishing away. This was long ago, back in the real world."

I was surprised Old Man Jenkins even remembered what happened in the real world.

"So every Friday night, he went out to the shore and spent his weekend on a boat. Everyone always told him to stop, what was surprising was that he had never caught a single fish in all his years of fishing, and had never seen anything in the water, but everywhere else he knows that people catch glorious fish in the ocean. So he continued to fish, believing there are fish. And the last I saw of him, before I came here, it was a Friday, and he said bye to me as he was departing on another of his trips"

"It's just a memory I have" Jenkins said, "Lately I try to remember things, anything about the other world, and treasure it. If it's in the past we have to respect it, because that is our past."

I tried to think of anything, but I couldn't really, it was strange, but I was trying to go back to a life which I didn't know very much about.

"Is this your friend's house?" Warren pointed behind us. Jenkins moved and tilted his head. "Yeah, this is it" There was a wooden verandah behind us, I hadn't noticed it before, but it was there. "He'll come out when he's ready" Jenkins said. "Meanwhile...let me do what I do best, here's another one, this is a bit of a strange one, so hold your socks."

"My friend told me of a game, where you could enter and start a new life. So I listened to him, but he never told me of all the complicated things that could happen in the game. In this game, everyone dodges bad things, but most people are already caught up in it, like oxidised tin, it is everywhere and it has become the norm. It's like a piece of coal laughing at other pieces of coal that the others are blacker than he is." 

"Is that this world?" I said, "Is that what you mean?"

"I don't know man" Jenkins said, "I'm just talking"

"In this world, the sun is always red, then some wise men gathered together to say something. The people in the world, especially the wise men, still had some parts of them that were ancient. A few of the wise men still had tails growing behind them, and thick hairs on their legs and faces. They all drink unfiltered water, then get nervous. The manager says it is the copper that comes from the red sun in the sky. It has a bad effect on everyone"
But then one of these wise men accuses the manager of anxiety. He says 'Anxiety is the symptom' So that's how the last unaffaected, unoxidised person was on the day the game started, I remembered seeing him." Jenkin's looked at us, "That was just another game I played, before this one, our programming team was involved in it for a while before rejecting it as too weird and strange" He laughed, "But compared to this world we're in now, I don't know which one's weirder. But that oen was scary, and I'm grateful this world's not like that."

I didn't realize that Guizan had been in so many games, but I guess that was what you did as a chief programmer in this age of virtual reality. "I've been in so many games" Jenkins said, "That I don't know what reality looks like anymore, it's actually a big problem really, that's why I have to cherish those few memories of the real world that I have."

Someone who had done so much leveling over so many worlds must have felt immense meaninglessness after drifting so many times. I couldn't imagine how he felt.

"Who did you bring this time?" A man came out onto the porch behind us. The house was positioned so that in the distance were the sand dunes that I didn't miss, and behind us was the rainforest.

"This is Warren" Jenkins said, "And this is Israel, both of them are players from the West" Then he turned to me, "This is Kei, he's come here to look around." Then Jenkins stood up and welcomed his friend "Everyone, this is Old Man Mally"

Mally was about half Jenkin's height, he looked like a mushroom next to a mouse. "I'm not an old man yet Jenkins"

Mally led us through the doorway to the porch, it clicked open, the interior of the house was decorated with carpet, the entrance was a staircase that wound down, as we got lower, a bright orange sunlight shone through the roof, and on the other end, in the living room, where there was a clear window, we saw the scenery down the mountain, all over the sand dunes, and far into the distance, the jagged mountains that we had crossed to get here.

"You like it?" Mally said.

"It's spectacular" I said.

"I looked all over for someplace like this, couldn't find one back in the real world, so I came here"
"That's not true"  I said, "There's plenty of places like this, maybe even more beautiful than this, in the real world"

"Yeah" Mally laughed and walked off, "But they have people in them"

He returned with drinks and snacks. Jenkins and Mally talked for a while about the latest happenings, before Jenkins started to talk to all of us again. Then Mally stood up and welcomed a person behind him in. 

"This is Laura" he said, "She came to visit me earlier" It was the same Laura that had welcomed me when I arrived in Rjukan. She was dressed up now, there were eyes to please. She looked at Jenkins, "Oh hey, how's it going, didn't expect to see you here" Then she looked at me with a blank expression. 

"This is Kei, Laura, and Warren, and Israel" Laura came up to greet herself politely, like it was her first time.

She didn't remember me. Was she a different person? Was there another player with the same appearance and name? 

I didn't know anymore. But it was strange, for some reason seeing her reminded me of Casey. I felt like I owed her something, but I didn't know how she felt. Casey that is.

"He's the player you took to my house" Jenkins was lying back in his chair sipping a drink of something, "Remember?"

Laura stared at me, then she clicked. "Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm really forgetful sometimes" She smiled, "Of course I remember you, I showed you to the respawning pool. And you know, Jenkins wentto the Programmer's meeting. He got a note saying that if he didn't attend, it was equivalent to saying "no" to change in the game."

She had told me that before.

"I was going to say" Jenkins said, "When I was walking out of Rjukan the other day, I saw a bunch of players walking in, and I saw you as well, but I didn't know who you were, I wondered who these good for nothing fellows were coming into Rjukan. But now I know you, I'm impressed" I had a similar experience seeing him walk out, it was just the first sight of seeing a stranger.

"Really? What's there to be impressed about?" 

"You're unique Kei, I think no one travels about as much as you do. No one wants to leave this world as much as you do" 

Was that supposed to be a compliment? Did that mean that he didn't want to leave as much?

The mood settled quickly, "You and her are really similar" Jenkins said. The others, Laura, Warren and Israel had turned into a slumber, and Mally was making some drinks quietly.

"Who?" I dreaded the answer.

"You and Elsie" he said. He saw my interest and continued talking, "You know Kei, I only met her once, but I can tell that Elsie is very perceptive and knowledgeable, just like you are."

We were in the right place, time, and situation to talk. And I could tell that he also had just as much to say to me as I did to him. "Some people have the talent, but are not in the right place to nurture it, others don't have the situation to nurture it. But for Elsie, I think this is her world, she's where she should be." Jenkins turned to me, "Can I tell you my theory? My idea?"

I nodded.

"In music, success is based on rhythm, harmony, melody, luck, and an audience. Sometimes you play really well but there is no audience reception, other times you don't play well and the audience will still love you, it is the atmosphere of where you are playing. To do very well and have the audience love you, it all depends on everything converging, luck and skill, effort and charisma."

"Basically" Jenkins said, "It's mostly beyond us, but what is important is to identify what is important and to follow it. That's why is also think that you want to leave."

"Why?"

"It's just the most natural for you. In this world everyone changes, because the environment is so different, so people all do different things. I also read that story" he looked at me, "The one about you"

"You did?"

"It might be talking about you and Elsie" he said, "That's what I think after I see the both of you"

It felt really weird to be placed in this category with Elsie, everyone was suggesting it, but I hardly knew her.

"Guizan's a curious fellow, he's always reading things that are out of his reach"


Jenkins said when Guizan talked about the rankings and his ambitions, he said that it was there and acknowledges it's existence. That is all he says. Jenkins said he grew up that his answer changed. (To Jenkins everyone is a kid)
"What kind of an answer is that?" Casey said. She only said it because Elsie wasn't here anymore. "He may as well have said that  

They wander off to nowhere in particular, before they realize it, Old Man Jenkin's best friend is there. (Later he will be there to comment on Elsie and Kei. “They're just like we were” says the old man. (So which of them was the one who gave up?)


"If you read it, then who is the split one what is their name? Who is the whole one?" I said. "Why does it have my name in it?"

Old Man Jenkins sighed. "I don't know, it's just a story"

And he smiles, "We're in a game, remember?"
  
It was difficult because Jenkins only spoke in stories. Everything he said was connected to something else. But I could see why people wanted me to talk to him, his wisdom had no bounds, and he had influenced those around him, I remembered Guizan telling Richard that it was just a game. I smiled.

"So what did you tell the couple who came to you? Hamish and Elsie."

They came and knocked on my door in the morning, that had travelled all night" he said, "It was right before the programmer's meeting"

I listened carefully

"They asked me about leaving this world, and they told me the theory of how if all players were to revert to level 1, then they could all escape"

I remembered telling Elsie about that, and us both being enthusiastic about it, we were going to become the strongest players to try and make it a reality.

"I told them that I thought it was a good idea" he said, "But it wasn't possible, it only lived in the world of the idealistic. Once levels are banished, this world will no longer exist, it only exists as a hierarchy slowly arching upwards towards the legendary sword, that was the way it was designed. To go against that design is...hopeful."

Elsie and I both had the same goal, but I had chickened out, now she was the only one continuing it. She wanted to be the strongest player, so she could equalize everyone and help them leave?

"How about the book?" I said, "What did she say of that?"

"You mean that story? Elsie doesn't like it"

"Which part of it?" I was surprised by how eager I was.

"The part where your name was written down" he said, "Your name written down in the legendary scripture"

"How did she react to it?"

"How did she react to it?" Jenkins sighed again and put his glass down "I think she was upset, because no matter how much she climbed, you would always be there. you see, that's why I think it's strange, you two seem too caught up in each other's hair, entangled, intertwined. It seems like too much is in common between you two."

"But what did she say?" I wanted to know if she wanted to topple the top. Defeat Lahoe.

"She didn't say anything" Jenkins said.

"But was she really surprised? How did she feel"

"She might have been disappointed that it was you" he said. "That of all players it was you, maybe Aloola chose you, I don't know, you would have to ask her"

"Did she say something about..." I coudln't finish the sentence, if it was true, it was too much.

"What do you mean?" Jenkins said. "You mean about being whole with you?"

"Maybe"

"You want to ask her how it felt to be together with her, and then split up? If she felt pain like you did? That's a little sadistic."

I felt like a disgusting person, scaring even Old Man Jenkins off with my thoughts.

Jenkins picked up his glass again. "But I can't say I don't understand it"

Mally came over, "With you two so deep in discussion, you've made even me interested"

"We're jsut talking about Elsie and Hamish visiting me, and what I told them, then about that story"

"Ah, that story" Mally sat down in front of me, "You want to know about that story? Here's what I think. It was all written by Aloola, there was another story in one of the other books I found near that one. It was about a girl who felt extremely hollow. Everyday she walked around the town, and the lake feeling hollow inside, like no matter how far she dug, it was empty. In order to obliterate the vacuum inside her, she stole everything she saw. After a while she became full, but she had so many things inside of her that were worthless and didn't relate at all. She was also unable to become pregnant because her body was so full already." Jenkins stopped, "And that's where the story ended. I personally think that this is what is special about Aloola. By making this world, she might have been trying to split herself apart, or empty herself of the things inside her."

What kind of mental lunatic had made this world? But at the same time, I understood that you had  to be hollow to create a world like this one. You also had to be highly dissatisfied with the world you lived in. It was like she was buying everything in this game to be a part of herself. The way Jenkins said it sounded ridiculous, it was a huge step further than what Jake told us at the programmer's meeting, it was vanity at its strongest.

Yet for some equally strange reason, I believed him.

"But you and Elsie are special" Jenkins said, "I could tell it when I met her, and I can tell it now as I talk to you like this. You are both destined for something." He continued, "I think Elsie is going to become a very powerful fighter, and you Kei, you are able to inspire other to leave this world, allow us to remember what we have been missing.

I was disappointed that my specialness was something so useless. but what Jenkins said was true, I did feel like somehow I was the only one interested in leaving, or going somewhere else. Everyone else didn't mind standing still here.

Laura woke up and nuzzled her cheek in the cushion. Warren and Israel were collapsed over each other in the corner, with toys all around them.

"Guizan always said this" I said, "He must have gotten his curiosity from you, but what is the most important thing in this game?"

"What is it? You say"

I nodded

"If you know, then you won't want to leave here". Old man Jenkins said, "You can't know of it, you can only know it" Jenkins smiled, "I'm glad you're curious, but in truth no one knows, people all over this world are asking themselves the same question. But it's different for everyone. This world is big enough for differences too."

I felt really open talking to Jenkins, my inner thoughts just poured out. "When our group first separated, I was terrified of the thought that the others would also want to leave. I was terrified I would end up alone. Then,"

"And isn't that what happened?"

"Not really" I said.

Jenkins stood up and said we should go for a walk, we walked along the rainforest again then came out next to a long beach. The waves were crashing onto the orange sand, but there wasn't anyone around us. Not a footstep in the sand.

"When Aloola made this world, she wanted a past" he said. "Because a world without a past and history is just a picture" He pointed to the footsteps we made behind us, "Now there are footsteps"

"Don't disregard the past, if it's in the past, then it's sacred. Maybe that's what Aloola was thinking when she made those stories. That's why she is trying to create something tangible, and where nothing can be thrown away." 

He sat down on a trunk that had drifted up the beach. He picked up a stick and threw it into the wind. He took a handful of sand and crushed it under his foot.

"Aloola, she came to me after she believed that another half of her had gone somewhere else. She was attracted to this game in a strange way. Love hate, insanity, it was all in there. It's hard to be a woman, especially when so much is expected of you."

"I don't know who she thought her other half was, maybe it was Lahoe, otherwise it could be anyone else. But before she left, she told me, back in the real world when she entered this world for the first time, She was the first person to ever step into this world she created you see, It was something completely different? She said it was something that should never be seen by humans. Do you know what she saw, Kei?"

"No" I said. 

"She says she saw a pitch black darkness." Jenkins looked at me with eyes covered in fear, "An emptiness so complete that you could stand in it. Without other people. Without movement. Without any sound. She said it was the scariest thing she ever saw. Can you imagine that?"

"So that's why she brought all of us into this?"

"But can you imagine how scary that must have been? When I first entered the world, I was second behind Aloola, but she had already redesigned the UI, she made it beautiful and homely, she renovated it like it was her dearest home. When I took my first baby steps into this world, I was completely amazed, amazed and shocked. It was beyond anything I had ever seen, and it was what I was always striving towards. I instantly fell in love with it." 

I found the words hard to say,"So Aloola brought us all here, we all have to live in this world she gave us...just because, she was lonely?" If that was true then it was too cruel. Too selfish.

"In the ancient days, this game was designed so that players could only level for others, I level for you, you level for me. There was no personal leveling. Kei, this game did not start when you joined, or when the beta testers joined, or even when us Programmer's joined. It was long before that, nobody knows how long, but there are records of its existence dating back to before the human bronze age of civilization. There are things in this game that were not yet invented in the time of the human race. We don't know how this came about and how both could co-exist, but it was true. We don't know when the first piece of code was invented. I think that Aloola had been making all sorts of histories and backstories to this world. To make it seem more real. To make it seem less random. But then when she actually entered her dream world, she saw only a deep pitiless darkness, and that instilled in her a fear so smooth and primal, so raw that nothing could eliminate it." Jenkins looked down at the ground, "As one of the leading programmers I'm ashamed to admit this, but in the end all of our suffering and all of our life has been caused by a human fault."

"What are you guys talking about?" Laura said. She was still murmuring in her sleep. It would be pretty weird if she heard this conversation. Especially when she didn't know where it was coming from.

"Do you want to go home Laura?" Jenkins said. 

Laura turned her head on the cushion she was lying on to me, then to Jenkins, "How can we go back? is it even possible? I thought i wasn't"

"No" Jenkins shook his head, "If it was, I would have taken that ship."

After talking to Old Man Jenkins, I knew he was brimming with information and raw untampered knowledge. He was like a pot full of calm pure distilled water. I met people who were like boiling pots of water with a surplus overflowing into steam over the edges. There were also people who were like cold cold water with a frozen layer on top  stuck for so long that it had a layer of dust collected to it, sometimes with the remnants of sticky sesame oil.

"I will go and teach you this" he said, "Now you go and teach the rest of the world" Old Man Jenkins said. "Something that is created out of so much fear and anxiety, there is something that is too great about it for normal people like me." He was talking about this world, his thoughts were always about this world.

"That's the last thing I told Lahoe" Jenkins said, "Before he set off to obtain the legendary lime green sword. And now, in his way, he is teaching the world. With great power comes a great service."

"Now let's go a bit further" Jenkins said. "I'll show you one of the beaches around here" We had been walking for almost an hour now, we went out nearing a cliff towering over the ocean and then came back into the shoreline next to the beaches.

Once the rocks under our feet had turned to sand and started to sink in with every step, I noticed two light footsteps in front of us. Jenkins pointed up ahead, there was a small grass hill on the beach, and an elegant wooden bench sat in the middle. On the bench was an old man facing the ocean and watching it silently. Next to the bench leaned an antique walking stick, and his pants were rolled up to stop them from getting wet when a slightly larger wave came in.

"That's Mally" Jenkins said, "My best friend"

Mally looked completely different, he was dressed the same, but he looked more knowledgeable. "Do you know how he survives in this world?" Jenkins said. 

"He sells weak players to the strong ones" Jenkins said.

"What?" It happened everywhere, but I didn't think someone actually did that...

"He was the one who designed the system where the strong feed on the weak, the respawning areas became populated after he did so. You could say that he is to blame for the hierarchy that we see in this game."

Wasn't that really really horrible? Because of him, none of the low level players had a chance and they were stuck in the abyss of the respawn areas.

"I know what you're thinking" Jenkins said. "But in his own way, he is just living an honest life , this is what he believes is most valuable"

"Valuable?" I couldn't believe what he was saying, "Because of him we can't fulfill our dream of trying to make every player level 1, because of him everyone is attacking each other." I was disgusted to think that I had been in his home drinking his tea, sitting on his couch, and even laughing.

"He was one of the first ones to recognize that this world is a pursuit of greed, everyone player is competing for the lime green sword, a player's true character only appears after he has fallen from a great height and respawned in a weak and filthy place. No one knows this better than the lower level players. But he saw it and used it to his advantage."

"So what if I go and attack him now?" I said, "Will I destroy the hierarchy that has been set in place?"

"It's too late now" Jenkins laughed, "It's all happened already, nothing will change now."

We both stared silently at him. I got the feeling that Jenkins was upset who his friend was, that's why he had told me about him. But at the same time he may have felt powerless or useless to change him.

"Do you see it?" Old Man Jenkins said, "The difference between him and me? It's just a small difference, not anything big enough to sever our relationship."

"What is it?" I said. "You admire him?"

"He has given up on this world, on this game" Jenkins said. "He was one of the very first of us to give up"

"And you haven't?" I looked at Jenkins. He looked back and slowly shook his head.

My gaze wandered back to Mally, he was a helpless old man staring at the great waves in the sea. The wind blew what was left of his hair like little seedlings grasping onto every inch of life, and beside him was a small and elegant walking stick. It was hard to believe that this neatly dressed man was the one moving this world, the leader of all of the suffering. A shadow supporting everything that we stood against."

He was Jenkins' best friend.

"He always comes out here to watch the sea" Jenkins said, "I guess he's wondering what's on the other side. No one really knows"

"Home" I said.

Jenkins looked at me, he broke into a smile and turned around, "Come on, let's go back, the meeting is starting tonight"

We picked up Warren and Israel, Laura decided to come with us as well. The five of us went back to Jenkin's house. When we got there Laura was tired, but she said she would help set up the room to have the meeting. 

"Because it might be my last time to be able to do so" she said. "Because we're leaving right?"

"I thought you liked this world?" I said.

"I do, but this world has shown me that there must be a God out there." Laura put one hand to her chest. "I really think so"

"This world taught you that? Not the real world?"

"This world and everything around us" Laura picked up a chair and stacked it on the pile I was holding. "It was all created by a human" she said, "With human knowledge and human thoughts and feelings"

I think I understood now what she was going to say next.

"That's why it can only go so far" she gave me a brilliant smile, "I'm bored of here" She picked up another chair and positioned it to make a small semicircle. 

"That's why the real world has to be made by a God" Laura said. "It's far more beautiful than this one" She flushed her eyelashes and picked up another chair. I was taken aback by it, her performance.

When we were done, the first programmers started to arrive. Old Man Jenkins didn't bother greeting them, he sat in the corner and scratched his head. Instead, Laura stood with beautiful flowers and handed out small program notes that she had prepared and written by hand.

I recognized a few of the faces, I waved to Fermol, he waved back. Then Una came in with a nice smile.  there was no Guizan behind her. And there was no Hamish and Elsie.

"All of the warring tribes have departed" Una said with a laugh. She meant that those who would fight had already fought. After the last meeting some of the suns were attacked and defeated, and they can't make it to this meeting in time, because they only respawned and are level one.

"Yeah"

"Are you okay?" Una leaned in to me, "You're looking a bit grim"

"Grim? No, I'm just nervous"

"You finally met Old Man Jenkins" Una said, "You're on a good path in this world. He told me that you were planning to leave this world. Do you have a plan?" She watched my expression, then sighed, "So that's why you're nervous. It's okay, there's plenty to do here."

"Una" I said, "If I find a way out, or if you guys help to find a way out; would you leave or would you want to stay?"

"I don't know, don't ask me" Una laughed nervously. "I guess I would leave" she fiddled with her nails, "Is that the answer you were looking for?"

"That's why I'm nervous" I said. "Because I incredibly really want to leave"

Laura called for the meeting to start, then she glared at me and walked over. "Sorry Kei, I'm going to have to kick you out now, this is the third meeting of the suns and you're not one of the suns, so sorry."

How I didn't, miss my hierarchy.

Then she turned to Una. "Come on, you too"

"Me?" Una said, "I came all the way here"

"You're an assistant, not a sun" Laura pointed to her sheet, "It says so clearly on here, so...I'm sorry as well"

Una shrugged and stepped out. When we got outside and breathed in the fresh air she laughed. "I didn't want to be in there anyway with those old farts"

We sat outside Jenkin's gate, it was still early in the afternoon, I remembered the experience of doing this a few days ago. Laura came out a few times to check on us, she brought us snacks and briefed us on what was being talked about inside. But after a while she also got too busy and stopped coming.

"You came here to hear about Guizan didn't you" I said.

"Yeah, I did" Una said. "Anything wrong with that"
"No"

"Well we're obviously less important than them" Una said, "That's why we're here, and they're in there"

"Don't mind it" I said, "It doesn't matter"

"You know what" Una said, "Kei, do you want to know how I see the world?"

"How?"

"This lets me see if things matter or not, if I'm not sure, then I ask myself a simple question to see how important something is"

"Okay" I said, "Go ahead"

"Well, this might seem like a while ago, but do you remember listening to music in the real world?"

"I haven't heard music in a while" I said, "But sure"

"Do you know an artist called Lana Del Rey?"

I remembered her, it wasn't something I was expecting to discuss in this world, but I did remember some of her music."

"Well I think" Una said, raising her fingers, "There are only two types of people in the world, those who like Lana and those who don't."

She pointed at me, "You like Lana del Rey and so does Guizan, so you two are okay." She nodded. "But I'm betting that all of those people in there, they don't like her."

"How do you know I like Lana Del Rey?"

"Because I know you" Una said, "People who like her all know each other, that's why. There's no way we wouldn't she said some interesting things like, wanting to bring her man to heaven. We've come a long way" Una said, "I don't know if Lana is still popular in our world or not, heck I haven't even heard one of her songs in what feels like years, but even here, I can still tell who does and doesn't like Lana. Peoples' shadows stick with them as soon as a strong light shines, even in this world, it's the same. They stick with a different gooeyness, but it's all still gooey and nasty" Una raised her chin. "Do you understand?"

"I think so" I said, "Maybe"

"It doesn't matter" she said, "I know you and I are on the same boat. And Elsie, she was also a lover of Lana."

"Really?"

"Yes, really"

When Laura first came out she explained, "They're talking about Elsie and Hamish, and Lahoe, and Guizan, and some others" she said. "Power play stuff"

Then next time she said, "It's about who should inherit the sword, who is the most likely to listen to them"

Then when she came back she apologized, "Sorry, this looks like it's going to take a while you guys. I don't know when they're going to discuss the possibilities of leaving." Laura turned back to the doors

"No problem" I said. 

Laura stopped midstep, her hand was on the door handle, but she let go and hurried back to me. She tried to speak quietly, but the emotions were escaping her.

"No, it is a problem" she said, "These people would rather discuss what is happening in the game, and how to gain more power in the game, more digital possessions, more strength and bragging rights, in the end it's not worth anything. It's so they can all be more powerful and less afraid of being at the bottom, less afraid of being left alone."
Then she took my hand in hers, "They should be talking about options of leaving, how to leave, and what is likely. Even if it's impossible..." Laura said. "It has to be done. We have to go home."

I nodded. Her willpower was contagious.

Laura saw my understanding and let go of my hand. She went back into the meeting room as swiftly as she had arrived.

Una looked at her leave, then at me. "Wow, she's forceful"

As I sat there, I just kept thinking, what if, what if, what if it wasn't possible to leave? What if no one knew a way? Was that why Aloola was still stuck here? What if I could never go home to see my parents and friends again. I felt so sad, recently I could hardly remember some of my friends' names. 

I wondered if they could still remember mine.

What did they think I was doing everyday, I tried to think of it but had no idea, did they picture me having fun everyday while they worked? Did they see me in misery? They probably couldn't imagine what the earth it was. Did they even imagine it?

I couldn't stand the thought of not seeing them ever again, that's why I always told myself that I was going to go home, no matter what. Staying here meant forever, with no change. Then, I would do the same and sit and watch as the ocean crashed into the shore over and over again, over and over. There was no end.

I heard voices in the distance. It wasn't from the meeting room, they were coming from up ahead. It was a lot of voices, I followed the voices like a man follows his fiancee. 

They led up a path I was familiar with, it was where Laura had led me, a small zig zag up, towards the graveyard. Una complained that her legs were sore.

This time, the graveyard was populated with players.

All of them were level one.

Then in the midst of them...a face I recognized.

"Hamish" Una said. "What are you doing here?" I heard a respect in her voice I hadn't heard before. then she said,

"Why are you level one?"

---

### Chapter Forty Seven

Hamish stood in front of us, he was still the same figure, but he looked different. 

"You're fat" Una said.

He wasn't wearing any armor, he wasn't carrying any weapons, he wasn't concealing a smirk. He was just....

"Plain" Una said. "You look so plain and rough, what happened to you"

Hamish didn't answer, he looked depressed, nothing like how he looked with the others.

"Where's Elsie?" I thought they were supposed to be together.

"Elsie? She surpassed me a long time ago" Hamish said. "I didn't realize she was so strong, She's still fighting him, now" He looked down at his hands, "I'm a joke, a complete joke."

"Who?"

Una pulled me away, "Hamish just lost to Lahoe, they were trying to get the sword, remember?" She talked really clearly, suddenly the fog in my head cleared, the top players were all fighting right now.

"Sadly" Una said, "Elsie is probably going to end up here as well, she won't be able to take on Lahoe alone. He's just too strong." 

"It wasn't Lahoe who defeated me" Hamish said. 

"What?" Una was shocked, "Then who?"

"It was Guizan wasn't it" I already knew it would be him.

They both looked at me, "Is it? Hamish?" Una said.

"He came out of nowhere, we didn't expect him, then after seeing him I thought I could take him, so we did a one on one. But he had that secret skill, a glowing light, and it just destroyed me." Hamish bit his lip, "I trained so hard, I was the second strongest player in this world!" Then just like a storm hit, Hamish started to cry out loud, like a baby.

Una went over and embraced him, she rocked his huge torso like a cot and nodded to me. "He'll be fine" she said. After a while she came back and said that I should stay here, she was going to Jenkin's place to announce what happened to the programmers.

After she waved bye I was left alone with Hamish and the rest of the players.

Hamish sulked for a while, then he leaned back down. I sat beside him, more out of obligation than friendship, I didn't know what to say to him. I had never experienced it before. But I remembered what Mally said. That a player's true character surfaced only after they had fallen from a great height. Is this what he meant? This despair and loss of self that Hamish was feeling, was this what Mally was looking at?

"Elsie is extremely talented" Hamish said. "they're fighting right now, if it's Elsie, then she might be able to win"

Whoever it was, the loser would end up here, in this respawn spot. Reborn to start up brand new and fresh.

"Kei" Hamish said, "Sorry to bother you with this"

"It's okay" I said, it wasn't like there was much else for me to do.

"You know" Hamish said,  "I'm a joke, what I've been doing, it's all a joke. I'm one big funny jester that's been entertaining everyone around me. That's what I've been feeling a lot recently." Then he looked at me, "You're not going to encourage me?"

I knew that if Una was here, she might say something like 'You're the top player, you're not a joke' or some other words of encouragement, but I didn't have any. 

Because it was true.

"I feel like I'm just an entertainer, everyone is bored so they watch me as I do something ridiculous, then in the end it was all for just a few laughs." He held up his fingers,  "I used to be a jester this big" It was an inch big, "But then I kept growing and now I am this big" He held his arms out wide. "Pretty big eh? Just becomign the biggest jester one step at a time."

"I admire you" I said, "At least you worked hard on something, and leveled so much, i only wish I could go so far."

Hamish ignored me and carried on, "But you know" Now he smiled, "I'm not the biggest jester here, that's reserved for Lahoe, he's the biggest fool of the lot." He sneered, "And he doesn't know it yet"

"Why are you a jester?" I said.

Hamish crossed his legs and leaned his hands on them. "You know Kei, I laboured hard for everything, and then in the end it all came crashing and falling down, now look what I have, nothing" He opened his inventory and showed me, it was empty, and he only had the standard clothes. "Everything's gone" he said, "Everything I was proud of, sad about, worried to lose, it's all gone."

"Well then I can understand" I said, "I too, everyone who has been able to leave me has already left"

Hamish looked at me silently, "You're worse than I am" 

He raised his hand. We did a small fist pump. I grinned when he grinned. It was always nice to relive memories of the other world. I was left alone by everyone, and only had a jester left, to sit with me in this ageless time. Otherwise I would be alone.

After Hamish fell quiet I stood up and walked to where the other players were sitting. They were all level one players, players who had given up on the game.
"Are you one of them farmers?" said a guy about my age. He was wearing a white singlet, his 'players conquered' stat was '-11'

"I'm not" I said. "I'm just a normal player"

"That's what they all say" another guy called Jade said. "If you want to attack us to get a diamond then do so, I can't be bothered anymore. I've respawned here five times already."

"You off for another one?" another player said to Jade. Then they both cracked up laughing. "That was funny, especially because he was trying to become a high level player. He was back with us in fifteen minutes."

The guys broke out into their own jokes, this was how they killed time, there wasn't much else to do. They didn't have any ambition, or desire to change. 

What did they think of leaving?

"Did you hear about those players who thought they were so strong?" 

"What about them?"

"They were all level 10, but had never seen anyone stronger than themselves, they came back to the respawn area and saw the weaklings as food. But then they attacked while they were still within the city gates." He was struggling to talk without laughing.

"So they all were defeated?"

"Slayed like pigs!"

These guys all had jokes, most of them had probably never happened, 'did you hear about that guy' jokes. If there was any players living most similarly to the other world, it would probably be these guys.

"No one really knows what's inside the gates and outside, it's not labeled. If it's here then it's inside, but if it's there it's outside."

"No, you see" A deeper voice said, "It depends on the mood of the guard, and how far he feels like walking on that day."

Even I had to laugh at that one.

"My friend tried to take advantage of that" Jade said, "He sat just inside the gates, trying to bait others to attack him, he managed to get a few diamonds off unsuspecting high level players. But then," Jade started laughing, "He saw another player sitting down, then he went forward to attack him, thinking it was an easy opportunity, he told me, he was like "Oh, this is going to be an easy level."

"But then it turned out he was also inside the city gates"

There was a hoard of laughter as soon as the punchline came through.

Jade carried his stories well, and everyone listened to them carefully when he spoke. "But that's not all" he said, "The next time, this guy saw a weak player, the weakest player, he had never reached level 2. So of course, being a kindhearted guy, he went up to him and said he woudl help him. Then he taught him his own strategy of baiting inside the gates."(weak swimmer Comes back as coach the next year)






The average level outside the gates kept increasing every week, I never knew.

"There's a guy at the store, they're buying items, then the shopkeeper draws a little sword on the item and says it's a "rare legendary item" then the guy actually believed it and bought it, he thought he had struck gold. Then they hear later that he actually wears it during a battle, he quickly swaps into it halfway through a team battle thinking it's much stronger, then the teammates burst out laughing because it looks like he's wearing chest nappies."

This one received some laughter, but I missed the next one when a player came up to talk to me.

"Hey, do you want to work together?" he said. "We can get diamonds together, then split them half half."

"From where?" This player was really tall and was wearing a long grey brown coat. He was slightly lower level than I was. But I felt that he had been defeated a few times and was more experienced.

"From these noobs of course" he said. "They reek of diamonds"

I looked at him for a while, "What? You interested or not?" he spat out something.

"No, sorry" I said.

"Why not?" he said.

"I don't want to attack other players" I was still saying the same things as so long ago.

"You think you're some kind of saint of something?" He looked disgusted, "If we don't do it, someone else is going to do it anyway, these players know that they're just fodder for other players. It's better to do it now, then we can develop ourselves and help them later on, that way it's better for everyone. I even see it like we're doing them a service; taking all of the hard work for them."

"If I met you earlier, then maybe, but now I'm not interested in those things anymore" I said.

"Sure, suit yourself, it's not my loss" He walked off to talk to some other high ranked player. When I watched him, I recognized myself, at least what I used to be like when I started playing this game, I was only interested in leveling and gaining experience. But now, it all looked foolish. Just as Hamish had said. If I had met him during those days, I would probably be good friends with him, but now, it was just saddening.

I went back to listening to the conversation happening. They were still telling jokes. The vultures who were watchng them stood on the outside, waiting for an opportunity to pounce.

"One of my friends drew a '3' on his friend's screen while he was asleep, then his friend woke up and doesn't realize it, the 3 was drawn perfectly right on where the level is, you know the place. So he thought he was level 3 for a week, and told everyone about it. Then he went and attacked a level 2 monster. He lost and respawned back as level 1. He was always level 1 lol, long story."

This was welcomed, "I've already heard that one, it's cycling around the other spots as well" said someone. "I'll tell you a better one, this comes from the place I was at three deaths before this one. It was right next to the dragons nests. There was a loud sound, it was the howl of a dragon monster, but one of the guys jokes that it's his friend's fart. His friend's fart after eating eggs actually sounds like the dragon monster. Then one time they are fighting the dragon monster, and his friend is charging towards it, then farts. Then the dragon monster paused and looked around, thinking another dragon monster was nearby. Even the dragon monster was fooled by this guy's fart. My friends were laughing too hard to attack it, they came back with their stomachs hurting."

Everyone was laughing, 

"Is that real?" a younger guy said.

"I cross my heart and swear to it, I saw it happen" the man said. "There's also another one..." Everyone quieted down to listen. "The dragon nests are a really strange place, I mean stranger than anything else I've seen. The dragons are supposed to be green right? But one time this chick and I were walking and we see a dragon, it is bright red and has pink spots. I mean it's a hazard, people will look at it and think what is up, how come this dragon has managed to become this way, in this world. What special circumstance has caused this? So anyway, after we thought about it, we decided to have it for dinner" 

"What did it taste like?"

"Like pork" 

"Really?" even I was surprised, there was no pork in this world, I hadn't tasted it in years.

The conversation moved onto fail stories, the same man continued talking, he had stories about everything. He was talking about a hunting party he was with, they were supposed 

Everyone asks the leader whether he organized it, he follows along and says he pressed the button to bring out the good weather.
Press mobile phone instead of remote. "Why isn't this working? Because it's not the remote, it's the mobile phone"


Becomes disgusted with how they are just sitting around and drinking when there are more important things they could be doing.


We hear a voice on the radio announcing the cricket score until late at night,
"66-2"
"66-4-4-4!"
"What is that?"
"It's Robert, announcing the cricket score"
"How does he know"
"God"

Eventually Una came back. Hamish was still sitting quietly by himself. He reminded me of how Warren was acting, maybe that was why Mally pointed out the big difference. Because he only saw the fallen players.

Una looked around "Elsie's not here yet?" I shook my head. 

"Guizan?"

I shook my head.

"Okay, well then let's go back" Una pulled me and Hamish up and walked us back to Jenkin's house. "I don't want to go alone, come with me" she said, "Laura's such a pain"

"Laura?"

"Yeah" Una spoke nonchalantly, "She's boring and no fun, I tried to talk to her but she goes on talking and it's so boring." She looked at Hamish, "You wouldn't know would you?"

Hamish sighed and shook his head as well. "I don't want to comment" Hamish and Una walked off, I had to run to catch up.

By the time we got back, the sun was setting, a strong orange haze zapped through the air, everything was coated in it. Hamish's hands, his eyebrows, and his jawline were all tinted a strange orange. When Una looked back at me, the area at the tip of her nostrils looked the same color. I wasn't sure if it was this world, or if I had always seen things this way, but it struck me for the first time today.

"She's not here" Una smiled "Just our luck"

"Why don't you like her?" I said. 

Una looked around before replying, "She's fine, she's just a bit quiet, and never has much to say. A bit boring and no fun." Una came closer, "But you know, I still talk to her normally and treat her normally, it's just that if I didn't have to talk to her, and I had the choice, then I wouldn't that's all."

The Laura I knew always had a lot to say, she even reminded me of Casey at times. 

"You know, she likes Hamish too" Una said. "She might like him more than Elsie does."

I smiled, that wasn't possible. Elsie didn't even like Hamish.

Una knocked on the door quietly, Laura immediately came out. Una said something to her quietly, then Laura looked over to us curiously. Una motioned for Hamish to come in, and held her hand out when I followed him. They both went inside, then Laura closed the door behind them. I guess they had something that they needed Hamish to hear inside.

I sat in the same position again, now the light had almost completely disappeared and the stars were out. Except, there was nothing there, they were just dots in the sky today.

I wondered if Jenkin's remembered to discuss my wanting to leave, I didn't know anymore. I hoped to leave, but I couldn't imagine seeing everyone for the last time. They had been here as long as I had, if we left, we would be going together.

The door opened, I briefly heard talking which disappeared. The door must have closed again, then I heard Fermol beside me.

"I had to come out" he said, "A breather"

"Sure" I nodded, though I doubted he could see me.

"It's always the same" he said, "They always talk about the same things in there, then all agree on the same thing at the end, it just keeps going around and around, I have never really seen anything happen, they're just a bunch of talkers."

"What are you discussing?" I said.
"Just more about who's going to control the sword" Fermol sighed, "It's all we ever talk about, I feel ashamed to be the programmer who designed this world"

Then he smiled, though I doubted I could really see him, "If they just listen to me, the bunch of idiots, then we could get somewhere. I have all these things I know we can do"

"I'm sure everyone feels that way" I said.

"Yeah, but mine are really true" he said.

I stood up, "Did you hear about it, that I was thinking about leaving?"

Fermol nodded, "Yeah, the Old Man mentioned it, they were going to discuss it, but they wanted to discuss the most urgent matters first, the inheritance of the legendary sword, and a bunch of other politics, I think your matter has been pushed to the end."

"Is it not very important?" I said, "I mean my...matter" Saying matter sounded weird, but it was what Fermol and everyone else called it.

"It's not that it's not important" Fermol said, "In some ways it's the most important. But nobody thinks it's possible" he said, "And if it's not possible, then it's not really worth discussing." He crossed his arms, "Tell me about it, if we coudl leave, then count me in, I've jsut about had enough of this, I've died so many times and respawned so many times that I'm sick of it."

I was becoming glad that Fermol had chosen this time to leave the meeting. This breather was turning out to be great company. 

"I could die for a smoke" he said. "But of course, there's none of that here"

"Me too" I said.

"You know" Fermol said, "I've got some friends who told me depressing things, unbelievable." He shook his head. "It's too cruel, even for us humans" He breathed out, as if a rich plume of smoke was escaping his lungs. "Some players, I won't mention any names, but players that you and I both know, I've heard that some of them cry themselves to sleep, they hurt themselves every night, some even attack themselves and force themselves to respawn each night."

Fermol shook his head, "It shouldn't happen, it's no good. They call it one night stands, it's a big joke, that they only survive one night before they make themselves respawn. People will joke about anything if they feel they have to, or if they feel like no one else is listening."

"But why?" I couldn't picture anyone I knew doing such things, it was horrible and desperate. 

"Just because they're sick of it" he said. "That's how much they want to leave. What is an absolute fear in one place is a paradise in another."

I suddenly felt really afraid, I didn't feel afraid but my body did, it shivered, and hairs were standing up. Probably even down to my pubic hair.

"But anyway, what I'm saying is, I hope you are able to leave" Fermol nodded to himself and walked back in.

So what did he tell me all of that for?

I sat still. What I began to realize was that I was powerless. Up to now, others like Elsie and Richard had been with me, and Casey. But now that they weren't here, I didn't know what to do. What should I do? All of the things I knew, and my level now, it was all because of the help I got from those people around me. I couldn't do anything by myself. I realized why I was so hasty to form a team, the Sparkling Dragons, it didn't come about from nothing, but from an intended purpose.

And I could only hope that the others felt the same. That they still had the Sparkling Dragons somewhere in them.

So why did we have to attack each other? Was it because the game told us to? Or was it just something that happened. Just like the sun rose and fell, and the waves swallowed and gobbled and gobbled and swallowed. 

"I'm sorry" I looked up to see Laura looking down at me. She held a blanket in her hands. "It's taking a lot longer than I expected, so I thought you might want this?" She shrugged and held out the blanket. I  thanked her and wrapped it around me. It wasn't warm, but the thought was. 

Laura watched me, I could tell she wanted to say something. "What is it?"

"You know, you shouldn't sit like that, this meeting is a really respectful place, if it looks bad, then others won't really respect it"

"Oh, ok, so what should I do?" I said.

"Sit like this", she demonstrated it, "You know, I used to work as a waiter, and the manager would always tell me to do this, and now I'm here, and I'm working as kind of a secretary, but they are all fine with it."

"What do you mean?" I said, "Why wouldn't they be fine with it"

"Well, because I used to think that I had to do something really properly, and then people would treat me well"

I looked into the sunset, the very last of it was still visible, Laura kept talking beside me. The sun hit the tip of the mountain, but the rest of ti was shrouded in darkness, every night it faded away like this, and every morning it came to life in the opposite order. The tip of the mountain was given the light for the longest.

"I know I can be dull" Laura said.

I suddenly felt really bad, I had completely missed what she was talking about.

"What?"

"No, sorry, I was just looking at the scenery" 

Laura moved her gaze up to the mountain I was looking, by now only the tip was still bright. She looked back to me. "I know Una doesn't really like me, that's why she ignored me today, she didn't even greet me."

"That's not true" I said, "Well maybe just a bit..."

"I try my best, when someone says they need something I go to help them, that's why I'm the secretary, so I can help everyone, then maybe they will appreciate me better." I realized that she also had a lot of her own insecurities. Things that were hidden deep inside her, when the gems were harnessed, so were a lot of other common stones.

"You're a great help" I said, "You shouldn't feel that way" But as Laura said this, then I started to wonder, I knew I shouldn't but I wondered if others also felt this way about me. Maybe to them I was just a boring picture hanging on the wall, they gave it a glance or two before moving on.

"You can say that" Laura said, "You're a great person Kei, I can say that from the short time I've gotten to know you. But it's okay, I don't mind it"

Although she obviously did...

Laura smiled, "Jenkins told me something; that if something good happens, then everyone is happy, but if something bad happens, then they are sad."

"So what do you mean?" I said.

"Jenkins said it, and it made me think, Happiness and sadness are not worth that much" Laura grinned, "You're the same as Una and Hamish, you didn't understand it."

I was surprised that she grouped me up with the others, especially when i felt that they were closer and I felt left out. Maybe it was just a normal feeling people had, to be left out.

"Jenkins is really wise isn't he" I said.

Laura sighed, "Actually, Jenkins is more lost than anyone else in this world, that's why he'll learn anything and memorize anything he's given. He's also made more mistakes than anyone. He once said that some people believe that, when people were very old, they completely forgot what they were doing and then they tried to spend the rest of their lives to remember their old memories and go back to it."

"I try so hard to be happy, but it doesn't really work, and the other way doesn't work either...anyway" Laura said. "I'm saying all of this Kei, not to bother you or anything okay? I just want to let you know that I'm honest, and a good person. And if you are going to leave, please make sure to take me okay? I mean that I will do good in the other world"

"Okay" I said, "But I'm not sure if I can go myself"

"Don't say that" Laura said, "It's a promise, okay?"

I nodded reluctantly. "It depends on this meeting"

"They're not going to agree to it" Laura said, "The programmers want us to stay, they will only leave for themselves, they don't want others to leave."

"We'll see"


Laura said she had to go back in to take minutes. I said I'd be waiting right here. After she left, I felt an enthusiasm, that I had to leave, it was something so strongly instilled in us. I sat there and listened to the muffled voices inside, wondering when they would finish and come out to tell me the results.

Then there was humming. It was Una, she had come out again.

"I tried my best Kei" she said, "But it was so boring, so I came out here to be with you"

"Great" I said.

"You were talking with Laura right? What did she say, poor you"

"We were just talking about leaving this world"

"I knew she would say that, it sounds just like her" Una remarked at her own comment. Una sat next to me and began to hum a tune.

"It just came to me suddenly" she said, "I'm humming it so I don't forget it"

"A song I knew said,
"In the time of the assassins, they say it doesn't take a miracle to raise someone from the dead." I never knew what it meant, but now I do.

"Another one is, "It's too late to sit in the sun, lately I've just begun"

"Sorry, am I bothering you?" she said. "I can stop if you want, you just started being weird"

"No" I said, "I'm just touched, that's all"

"Okay..." Una rolled her eyes, "That was weird air. It was like Elsie for a second." 

"Elsie?"

"Yeah she's all weird sometimes."

"How about Casey?" I said.

"Casey? Oh that girl you traveled with, I don't really know her so I can't say."

"How about Richard then?"

"He was always around you" Una said, "They're your team not mine, don't ask me"

 Una pointed at me "You're the same as them" she said. "Actually, all of your team act the same, I don't know how to say it but I feel that you do"

She smiled, "I wish I had a team like that, even if you are far apart, or are close, or are angry or happy with each other, I wish I could be somewhere like that."

"Alright" Una suddenly stood up, "I'm going to go back in now" She looked back, "Sorry to make you wait out here, but I promise to make them discuss it"

"No problem, thanks Una" I said. Now my feet were just itching to leave, I was itching to see my parents again, to get back home and have my feet on real soil. Although the real and this soil were indistinguishable. They were distinguishable.

I sat alone for a lot longer. I even started to feel hungry, but the discussion was still going on. Chairs started to move, and feet clapped the ground, then voices got louder. Talking emerged as the doors opened. Then the first people came to open the gate.

"What are you doing here?" someone said. "Were you outside this whole time?"

Una's shadow emerged, "Sorry Kei, I'll invite you in to talk to the chairs" She came forward and showed me in. "They said they wanted to talk to you personally"

That was never a good sign.

It was only two players sitting there, on the right was Jenkin's, he looked cheerful as usual. The other programmer was Jake. He was the man with the negative view.

"Are you Kei?" he said. Jake looked behind me, Laura and Una were sitting.

"Don't mind us" Una said.

Jake sighed, he moved some papers on his desk around. "Kei, I hear you want to leave this world?"

I nodded, "that is correct sir"

"I don't know if anyone has told you this already" he said, "But it's impossible, we haven't found a way, if there were a way I would love to hear it, my legs are getting tired, I'm an old man, but here I don't feel old at all." Jake stared at me, waiting for an answer.

"I don't have any Sir" I said, "Try to revert every player's level back to level one. Guizan said he would try to do it."

"Guizan has changed" Jake said, "He used to want that, now no one knows what he's trying to do, he's fighting Elsie and Lahoe right now, the three of them are having a duel. Surprisingly, Lahoe can't take the two of them together. We don't know what's going to happen"

"Besides, do you think that's possible? Even for Guizan?" Jake brushed his knuckles. "You want to make every player equal, no player is stronger than the other, no discrimination or differences will exist, and things will be much clearer between players."

"Exactly" I said, "And then we will be able to leave. If every player wishes for it, then why won't it work."

"Let me ask you a question" Jake said, "If you were the strongest player, would you want to leave, knowing that you have all the power in the world? Over so many other players, you could command anything of them instantly."

I shook my head "I don't know"

"And besides, this world was designed for differences, the sword is testimony to that. To try and make everything equal is to go against nature."

Did he mean that this world was natural? The way it was?
Jake watched me, he wasn't condescending, he wasn't upset, he wasn't threatened; he was just tired. Like so many others who had seen too much, he grew tired and weary. It felt like he wanted to leave, or at least had once wanted to.

"But I'm not discouraging you" Jake said, "I welcome true felt players like you who want to change the world" he said, "To leave is the same as changing it. But I want you not to feel too much hope in what you're trying to achieve. There have been many others who have come to us with that proposition." he said, "And guess where they are now. Most of them are lying in those re-spawn pits all over the map."

He paused. "But if you really insist..." He looked at Old Man Jenkins, Old Man Jenkins nodded in agreement. Jake looked at me sternly. "There is one way we know of, but you might not like it"

I suddenly felt blood rushing to my body, there was a way? "What is it?"

"One player can log out at a time" he said. "The player who possesses the legendary sword has the option to log out. But they are the only ones with that privilege"

"They do? Then how come they haven't done so." I didn't like how he said privilege, as if it was something exclusive that only they deserved.

"They haven't done so" Jake said, "Because they don't want to, that's what's so ironic about this game. One you are at the top, you stay there."

"If I may" Old Man Jenkins came in, "Lahoe was the first player to come to me about leaving this game, he was obsessed with the idea of leaving. But when he got there, to the top, I don't think he has the strength to leave. Once you possess the power, it requires too much power to relinquish."

"You see" Jake raised his eyebrows, "It's not all small talk when we talk about the inheritance of the sword. If we can make a chain of players, then they will log out one by one, we just have to gain possession of it."

I was surprised, so in the end all of the clues were leading to becoming the strongest player, and to gain control of the legendary sword. But to do so, I would have to attack Lahoe. Attack another player...

Jake stood up and stacked his paperwork. "I'm not strong on this, I don't believe you can do it" he looked at Jenkins, and then back at me. "But please, surprise me. If you're able to leave this world, everyone will be watching." He smiled, "I hope to not see you again"

I agreed

Una pulled my arm, "Let's go Kei" she said. She was smiling, "Come on, Let's go, let's go, let's go" once we were outside she told me her plan. 

"When you're able to leave, tell me" she said. "I'm coming with you"

"Okay" I said. "Is that all?"

Laura saw us laughing and walked past us. Una probably gave her a bad face or something. "So what's happening next?" Una said. She suddenly became enthusiastic about the idea since I talked to Jake about it. "You're going to become the strongest player!" she said, "That's so cool Kei"

"But I won't be up there for long"

"It's still handsome and reliable" she sat down on a step and indicated for me to do the same. Then she immediately stood up and said "Never mind, let's go for a walk"

She pulled me with her up towards the graveyard. We started the winding path up. Before I noticed it we had left Jenkin's place behind and were alone. It was quiet all around us. Una had stopped talking, and was walking in front of me quietly. I could only see her figure, her legs pushing off the ground and carrying her up. She looked kind of cute, and I started to get nervous. Something I felt when I was around Casey.

Did I like her?

"Una, where are we going?" I said.

She didn't answer and kept walking up the hill. I stopped asking and followed her.

Una stopped in her tracks and faced me with a smile. She pulled out her inventory and put some armor on herself. It was an action that she had prepared for a long time.

"Okay" she said. "This was long overdue" She tilted her head and touched her hair.

"Huh?" I said,

"Remember back at the second meeting of the suns?" she said. 

"Are you talking about..." I didn't want to talk about Guizan and Casey, I wanted to pretend that it never happened. "I don't really mind it" I thought that was the truth.

"What kind of boyfriend are you?" Una sighed, "Well even if you don't mind, I do. Guizan was my boyfriend too you know. Even though I knew he liked Casey the whole time..." She stopped speaking, I guess she saw how hurt I felt.

"Never mind" Una looked away. "I was saying, you should kiss me now" She put her finger on her bottom lip. "Here, I won't look" Then, "Do it quickly, before I change my mind"

I stood there, on the corner of a slope, leading up to somewhere. Una had her eyes closed, with the wind lapping against her hair, I looked at her lips, then at her clenched shut eyes, then the few strands of hair that were tucked in behind her ear, then at the small freckles that sat on her cheek.

I just stood there silently, unable to move. I literally couldn't move, because I was a picture, nothing more. A picture stood still in time.

Una gradually opened her eyes, her left eyelid came open slightly earlier than her right. "Do you want to kiss me or not?" Una blushed, "I was waiting for you, now you make me look ridiculous"

"I can't" I said, I couldn't tell her that I was frozen, like the software that I was made up of had malfunctioned. Malfunctioned so badly that I couldn't do anything.

"You saw them kissing right? I was there with you" Una said, "I thought this would make it even, for you and for me." She came closer, "Besides, I like you. Do you know what they did after you left? They were..."

"I'm going" I cut her off and continued up the slope, "I have to go"

I heard Una complaining, "You're such a jerk, you know that? You can't leave a girl like this in the open at night"

Before I knew it, I was alone again. I went to the graveyard. I wanted to be with the other players who kept respawning, for some reason they made me comfortable.

They were still talking quietly amongst themselves, but there were no more jokes, it was too late for that. I noticed a few new players here, as well as the regular old ones.

I heard a gentle sobbing. One of the older players stood up and threw a harsh comment at the sobbing player to be quiet. "I'm tryin ta sleep"

The sobbing stopped for a few minutes, then it came back again, like a gentle lullaby. I finally decided to go and check out what was wrong. 

"Nothing much" the player said.

"He's a loser" The older player said, "We're all losers here, but he's the biggest"

This player couldn't stop crying, he was wearing the basic clothes but his hair was clean and tidy. "My inventory is empty" he said. "I'm a jester, a big joke."

"What do you mean?" I said.

"Do you know who I am?" he said.

"No"

"Exactly" he said, "I'm a nobody"

"We all are" I said. "Who knows anyone else here? We're all just left alone"

He looked up at me, the back of his hand under his eye. "How can you say that, that's so bad" he started deep breathing. He was really skinny and had dirt all over his arms. His legs were bare, and his toes had thick clumps of dirt stuck with worms wriggling between them. 

"I entertained the world for a while" he said. "But I was just a jester, making people laugh. But that was before, now I'm nothing" he raised a bony finger to point at a flag. "I'm just like that rag now, worth the same as a piece of cloth. That cloth is probably laughing at me."

Then it hit me, I looked up this player's name. 

Lahoe - Level 1.

"You're Lahoe?" Una said. I turned to see her behind me, looking at Lahoe in shock.

The player looked up, "Have you come to laugh at me?"

Una was shocked, then she grinned, "You were defeated! Haha, I knew it" Then she looked at me, then the embarrassment returned. "I mean...never mind"

"That girl was too strong" he said. "They both teamed up against me, now they're fighting each other."

"Elsie and Guizan are fighting" Una grinned, "This is going to be interesting. So who has the sword?"

"I'm a nobody now, I used to be in possession of unimaginable power"

"Elsie's going to win this fight" I just knew she was going to win, there was no doubt about it. 

Una tried to grab Lahoe's hand "Let's go" she said, but he let go. 

"You coming or not?" she looked at me then shrugged and walked off. I followed Una, we were headed back to report what had taken place. That Lahoe had been defeated. But I had the feeling that it wasn't as important anymore.

Una stopped still after a few steps. She put her finger to her lips and mouthed 'shhh' She pointed behind us, and under the slight moonlight, I saw first Lahoe's leg, then his whole body emerged. He stopped when he saw us stop.

"He's a loser" Una said, "That's what they all do, they just follow you. He's like a pale thin skinny puppy that's lost it's mother. He's been thirsty for a long time, Warren as well, they're all the same" Una carried on, "It's not cruel you know, I'm just stating facts, it's not good to look at"

I looked back to see Lahoe following us, quietly. He didn't look like he had lost much, he must have been made to feel bored and lonely with the power that he had.

When we got back, all of the players had gone, a small light stayed on in the house. Jenkins opened the door and welcomed us in. "Una, you can stay here tonight, a few of the other players have already gone to sleep so don't feel like you are intruding." Una bowed and smiled. Then Jenkins peered over our shoulders, he squinted to see who it was, once he realized, he waved him over.

"Lahoe, you're welcome to join us as well"

It took a while before Lahoe came over, he walked slowly, looking at his steps and not speaking.

Jenkins looked at us, "So it means the fight is between Guizan and Elsie. I never thought it would come to this."

"I learnt quite a lot about Lahoe when he first visited me." Old Man Jenkins said, "He went to University at fourteen and graduated a year later. He was smart enough for a masters. That's probably why he had enough power to destroy everyone." Lahoe smiled when he heard his name, but it didn't look like he understood what we were saying.

Una shrugged, "Then why is he in this game? If you're smart, you don't play games, isn't that how that world worked?"

"Honestly, when Lahoe first came to me, he didn't believe in the programmers, he just wanted answers. So I had to prove it to him, Warren was here as well, so I proved it to both of them" He nodded at Lahoe, "Didn't I? Do you remember?"

"Warren knew where we were going." Jenkins said, "Can you guess where I took them?"

Una put a finger to her lips, "To prove that you were in the game?"

I couldn't think of anywhere. "You brought them here to this world?" That was kind of what Aloola had done with everyone.

"No, but good try" Jenkins said, "I took them to see the credits of this game. If I was one of the programmers, then my name would be in them"

Warren was really smart, I don't know how he was still unable to graduate from Uni.

"There are credits in this game?" I said.

"They're at a place you go after you finish the game, it was actually designed by me" Jenkin's said, It's one of the few things I designed, most of this was made by Aloola" He picked up the wooden pot with our soup in it. "This wood, this shape, every last detail of it was designed by her, I don't know how many hours it would take, just to make this pot. I was astonished when I first saw this world" Jenkin's said, "She's an absolute genius. One of the few who ever existed"

Jenkins explained the credits, "I knew that it would be the last thing a lot of players saw, so in a sense it was the punchline, the climax of the whole game. It was the last of this world that they saw. I made the words sparkle, and I will tell you, my name is in there."

Jenkins pointed at me, "So when, or if you see the words, I want you to see my name, my real name, as it's written."

I nodded. "That's only if we get out. No one might ever see the credits ever, Jenkins, your work may have gone to waste."

"Don't say that" Jenkins said. "That makes me feel sad"

Richard shrugged, "If you're smart you don't play games"

"Maybe he didn't make it into the school" I said. 

"He was too short" Una said.

We all looked at each other and laughed. Jenkins stared at us in confusion.

Lahoe groaned. "I was able to log out" he said. "That was my big mistake, a huge mistake, my biggest mistake was that I didn't press that button. I didn't have to be here anymore."

"Did the button work?" Una said.

"He doesn't know" I said, "He never pressed it"

"I know that" Una said.

"Listen to him" Jenkins said, "He's going to talk now, finally"

Lahoe was full of things that we wanted to know about, answers to so many questions we would have loved to know, and answers to so many things we wouldn't have liked to know. He was the only one in the world who knew. We only knew from what we saw at the respawn areas, and of what everyone talked about, much of it was hidden.

"Where's Hamish?" Lahoe said, "Have you seen him?"

I didn't know where he went. This was the strongest player looking for another strong player. Probably there were things that only they could understand.

"Do you want to see him?" Una said, 

"No" Lahoe shook his head. "I wanted to apologize to him, it's about that girl with the blue band."

"The girl with the blue band on her leg?" Una said, "She's called Elsie"

"Well, she was the one who finished off Hamish" Lahoe said, "I knew they were friends, but she came and supported me later on, I never asked for it though"

I couldn't imagine it, Elsie striking the last blow on the second strongest player. Did that mean that she was even stronger than Hamish? Just how far did her limits extend? Hamish was supposed to take down Lahoe, but Elsie had ruined all plans.

She kept moving higher and higher up the ranks, to get with the strongest man. And once she got there, she would throw them away to get even stronger.

"When Hamish approached me, I sensed that he was stronger" Lahoe said, "I didn't notice it immediately, but when I did, it was already too late" Lahoe shivered, "He had a badness supporting him, standing right beside him."

Was that Elsie? Who else could he mean... 

"Then, the girl with the blue leg band moved and stood beside me. I didn't want her to be there, but she didn't budge, and defeated Hamish. Decimated him right in front of me."

Lahoe started sobbing, small open mouths, "I never wanted to admit it, but Hamish was my friend, he was the closest friend I had." Jenkins moved away and fetched a bowl of soup for Lahoe to have.

"Here, have this and relax" Jenkins said, "You're not over there anymore" 

"I know I was notorious" Lahoe said,  "Many people didn't like me. But even more admired me. I had created many enemies, just because of what I possessed, and they called me the 'golden' player, and said everyone else revolved around me." Lahoe swallowed some soup, "But I never asked for it, I never did any of that, I just wanted to become stronger to be able to leave this world."

"But it all changed when I became the strongest" Lahoe said, "Then suddenly I was leagues above everyone, hunters everywhere came to hunt me, some even pretended to be friends. Everyone wanted to destroy me, so that they could tell others about it. But when I got the sword, I was too strong, nobody could touch me. With one swing of the sword, I destroyed fifty players and rose by fifty ranks. If I worked hard, I could rise over two hundred ranks in a day."

I had never even thought of this before. He was too strong. Too strong that he was bored.

"So why didn't you leave?" Una said, "You were able to right?"

"Because" Lahoe said, "If I leave, I would never hold the sword again, and I would never have anyone approach me. Whether it was to kill me or not, I would never see people again. They hated me because I was amazingly skilled."

"Then you left didn't you?" Una said. "I heard about that"



"After I came in possession of the sword, I isolated myself. I would rather be depressed than lose the sword." Lahoe said, "Having the sword was better than any pain I would feel in not having it. Besides, I couldn't live with myself knowing that I had given up the sword. But because of it, I had no friends anymore, no one to talk about the weather with, about kids, and jobs."

It reminded me of something I saw a week ago. When I heard the beautiful sounds of the piano emanating from thin air. I thought the person playing the piano was my friend, but it was actually my enemy. I think it was my enemy.

"Do you realize my power?" Lahoe said, "Even Hamish, he trembled in fear whenever he saw me, whenever I summoned him to see me. He was the only one, the closest one to being able to defeat me, yet he trembled like a little dog whenever he saw me. It's a strange feeling, I felt extremely powerful, but also, really lonely. The only one who could beat me was myself." Lahoe said. "I forgot long ago, that this world was just a game. It's a real world."

"When I became the number one player, I was surprised to find myself becoming so famous, everyone was trying to be me, they asked for advice, on how to get stronger, but in the end they would be facing me. I was frozen in fear, so I stopped training and drops ranks. They started saying that the sword was worth about 50 ranks. But then I started to slash enemies and rise 500 ranks at once. Whole armies of players." Lahoe said, "Can you imagine that? Whole armies have grouped up to face me, their total rank far surpassing mine, but in the end I just swing a sword and they are all wiped out. It's an incredibly powerful feeling, exciting even, but also depressing, that you have become so inhumane and so far from human. But then when Elsie started to get stronger, I started to sense a new fear, by now I had so many fears growing inside of me that it was hard to identify them. I started attacking other players again, just to grow in rank, I saw Elsie's rank grow day by day, especially after she joined Hamish. Then I needed to grow in ranks as well, attack as many players as I could, to stay at the top for a bit longer." 

"But then I also retreated into somewhere away" Lahoe said, "I became afraid that someone would take the sword away from me, so I ran away so I would never see anyone. I know there's someone else now, that the fear has passed onto"

"It's Elsie isn't it?" I said.

"She has inherited it, a fear of being on top, only the strongest in the world see it" Lahoe said. "But there's more than that, an even scarier thing that you can only see if you are at the very top"

"It's also bad luck, if this game had been about anything else..." 

"I understand" I said "It will be different"

"No" Lahoe disagreed, "No matter what this game was about, he would still be the best and at the top, because that is all he knows, he is fake, and so is everyone else who is at the top." 

"That's not true, you're skilled" I said, "Very talented"

Lahoe laughed. "I got defeated by someone as ignorant as them. I trained hard and thought I could get out of here, but in reality I was just digging deeper and deeper into the clutches of this game."

"There is no death here, it's worse than death, death would be paradise revolved. We have escaped the clutches of death. And now nothign is after us, no threats are nearby, nothing will ever harm us again.
Ever" 

Lahoe smiled, "But that's not the scariest thing" he said, "The scariest thing was that I got to the top and immediately felt lost, I didn't know where to go. But people kept chasing me from the back, so I had to keep climbing up into the darkness. I didn't dare look forward, because if I did, I would only see a pitch black darkness, and behind me others were following up and up, higher and higher. The looked forward and saw me."

"Don't say any more" Una said. "It's getting weird"

"Do you know that story, by Akutagawa Ryuunosuke?" Lahoe said, "I used to be a big Literature fan"

"You mean back in the real world?" I said.

"Yeah, the people in the underworld are trying to climb a weak silk thread out into the normal world. I find myself thinking about that story a lot recently, when they saw the thread leading out, everyone tried to get on and climb up, but it snapped because of the weight, then they fell to the floor with their hope of leaving crushed in their hands."
 
"So why didn't you leave?" I said.

"Because I only see this now" Lahoe said, "How could I leave?", it was a genuine question, but beneath the surface it was echoing with the desperate screams of a thousand people. I was part of a crew of five extremely dedicated members, we all worked hard together to get the sword, but I haven't spoken to 
them in a long time, ever since I became the strongest. Why did I have to fall"

"Don't you see it?" Una said, "You're so much better off now, with us here" 

Lahoe shook his head and started to weep, "I wish I could go back, I really really want to go back"

"He's an idiot" Una looked at me and Old man Jenkins"

"I first became afraid" Lahoe said, "Really afraid. It was after I learnt a few new moves that made me even more invincible. It was a new style of fighting that I thought was original. But then when some other players saw me using it, they said it was the fighting style of the girl with the blue band around her leg. They said that she fought like that, and she always had." 

"Then I became afraid, that she would surpass me, and I would become a nothing. I really disliked her."

Una rubbed her forehead, "I'm sick of listening to him, can we just be quiet and go to sleep? All he says is that he's scared of this, scared of that, I don't really care, no one wants to listen to that negativity."

"Then what is it that you want?" I said.

"I just want to leave this world" Una said.

I gripped my fists. For once, a decision crossed my mind, long enough that I could recognize it as something firm, but short enough to make me say it with virility. "I'm going to try and leave" 

Jenkins moved one eyelid, "What did you say?"

"I'm going to leave" I said. "And if anyone wants to leave as well, they should follow me"

"Really?" Una said, "That doesn't sound like you Kei, you sound so confident."

"I'm sure of this" I said. "It's time to leave now"

I know everyone heard me, because the room fell silent. 

"I'm coming with you" Una said. "I mean I would like to, if you don't mind, although I don't know what you are going to do"

"I don't know either" I said, "I need to ask everyone first."

### Chapter Forty Eight

_Sorry guys, that was a long one, but it was a necessary length....hehehehehe, Thanks for sticking through, if you're still here, then I bet you'll love what's next!!!! Cheerios!!! It's nearing the end of the story, and I'm starting to miss it already...strange how a mere story can do that._

I asked Jenkins if he also wanted to come. But he said he had gotten too used to this world, and at his age it would be too big a difference for change. So the next day I left by myself. Una said she wanted to see who would emerge the victor, Guizan or Elsie. I didn't get her fixation on it. But she promised me that she would join me when I left.

"I think Guizan will come along too" Una said, "I'll wait here for him, he might respawn here. I think he's done enough of his fighting games it's time to leave. If he hears it's you, he might be interested." 

"What if Elsie loses"

"I'll pretend I didn't hear that" Una smiled and we laughed together.

Old Man Jenkins came to the entrance to say farewell, Lahoe and Warren stood beside him. They smiled when he smiled and frowned when he frowned.

"I hope you all the best" he said, "If it's you, I'm sure something will happen, though I don't know if you will be able to leave, I might see you again." He stood still and looked at me, his mouth moved slightly, as if he wanted to say something. But for some reason he didn't.

I waved goodbye and set off. 

"Kei" Jenkins rounded in front of me. He took a breath before speaking, "I know you came to me for answers" he said, "I'm sorry if I couldn't give them to you. But the truth is, I've found that I've turned into someone who tells stories, not someone who might be what you are looking for"

"No, thank you" I said. "You really helped me, and I can only hope to meet someone as broad as you"

Jenkins breathed out. "Well, I won't hold you back, go on, leave"

After a few steps I didn't look back anymore.

Una called out, "Kei, the duel between the two is getting really big, a lot of bystanders are getting caught up in it and have respawned, they've told me all sorts of things about it, but its looking really close. This world is going to change" I heard her laugh in the way she always did. Then Warren and Lahoe's laughter echoed off hers.

I didn't look back anymore because I had decided not to.

"Thanks" I said.

I stepped onto the path to leave Rjukan. But after a few steps a dress came running, she had a basket in her hands, her hair was flailing all around.

"Kei, you didn't tell me you were leaving so early" Laura said. "Here's some freshly picked fruit, it will keep you going."

"Thank you Laura" I said.

"Please enjoy the berries" Laura stood still, "Make sure you remember about me"
 
"It's okay" I said. "I won't forget to contact you"

"How will I know?"

"You will know" I put one of the fruits into my mouth. "It's delicious Laura, thanks" I didn't scout Laura's expression, but I knew she was happy.

After an hour of walking I was nearing the base of the valley, the sand dunes were returning in the horizon. The green wind let the river soil bloom. The sign written 'Rjukan' was still hanging on it's hinge, looking as dilapidated as it always did, always would.

I'm sure that there are more things in life than some other things.

After another hour, I was at the crossroad, it was the first turn off that led out of Rjukan. It was a first turn off the main track.

The first sign of other players was well into the afternoon. A small tavern stood against the backdrop of the mountains. There were voices cheering from within. I thought the tavern was owned by a computer generated character, but the prices of the drinks said otherwise.

"We don't drink at those places" A guy came up to me. "Filthy programs, real players are the real atmosphere" he swung through some doors, on the other side was a brownish room. It was like a cowboy bar in one of the movies, when I walked in all of the heads turned. All of them were guys, or women who looked like guys.

One of the guys frowned, "Oh we've seen enough blokes, bring in the chicks."

The heads swiveled around to their drinks after I fit into the scenery. I ordered some water. The barman's name was 'Barry' he was level 20. But I assumed his cooking skills were much higher.

"Where are you off to?" he swiped the glass of water to me. "We don't get many travelers around here"

"I'm looking for my friends" I said.

"Are you from some kind of team?"

I drank the glass. "We're called the Sparkling Dragons. We used to be called so"

"A girl came by" Barry said. "She said she was heading South, but if someone called Kei came along, I should tell them that she's there." He grinned, "There I said it, I don't know if it means anything to you, but we haven't seen any girls around here in a while, none that are pretty like her, so count yourself lucky that you've got someone like her thinking of you"

"Thank you" I said. "I'll go there now" I went to step out, then realized I forgot to pay. But when I took my wallet out Barry raised his hand. "It's free of charge" he said. "Everything in here is free of charge, it doesn't cost anything to serve drinks."

It was something you could only say about this world. "Good luck" I walked through the swing door.

In another hour, I was far from any civilization, the landscape changed again, it was ltitered with shrubs of grass, barely reaching ankle height, the soil was becoming soft, and probably fertile. In front of some houses a sign hung, it said 'Lake Paradise'

There was a small lake in the middle. A man was sitting on a bench and gazing at it. He looked liek he could have been sitting there for years before I finally found him. It was a scene not dissimilar to watching Malley as he gazed down the deserted beach. I wondered how the man had got here, what route he had taken to come to this small place.

"Sorry, excuse me" I said.

The men craned his neck then stood up and smiled. "It's great to have visitors, you're most welcome here"

He spoke like it was his home, but it was just some place that he had found and decided to live in. None of it belonged to him. "Where have you come from"

"From Rjukan" I said. 

His eyebrows rose, "How is it there? I was thinking of retiring there one day."

"Do you know if a girl is here?" I didn't have time to hear him talk about retirement, when he hadn't even worked.

"You're looking for Casey aren't you" he crossed his arms. 

"How did you know?" 

"She's a wonderful person, I had a feeling a handsome young man would come to get her sometime soon." He picked up a twig off the ground. "Come, follow me, I'll take you to her"

He talked as we walked, "She's working at a small restaurant, completely owned by players, and all of us locals go there to eat every Friday. It's a splendid place, she's a lovely girl. You're very lucky."

I nodded. It sounded like Casey, for her to be cooking, she must be very good at it. We walked along the lake for a while, then a white palace appeared, it had tabels outside, and a small staircase leading to the second storey.

"That's the barnacle" the man said, "That's the best place to eat in this world" He pointed to it with his twig, and kept talking about how amazing it was. I couldn't help wondering whether he had leveled any of his own skills, or if he just went around talking about this restaurant to all visitors.

"Let me take you in, don't just walk off" he said. He grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the entrance. The bell rang as the door swung open. A warm smell of spices and fresh soup sprinted towards us. A few waitresses looked up to see who was coming.

I pulled my hand loose from his and stepped back. He turned his head, "What's wrong? We're here"

"Thank you" I said, "I want to go in when I'm ready to"

He shrugged, "Sure" The door closed behind him with the same ring of the bell. I breathed deeply, and made sure I was ready. In the end I walked back around the lake, for some reason I was feeling nervous when I was here. So close to Casey.

I made my way back, it was already midday, the store was quiet. I swung the door open carefully, the sound of the bell ringing felt too loud. 

Every one of my steps felt like a drummers banging. There were a few players sitting here and there, the man was nowhere to be seen.

I sat at a table and looked over the menu. I couldn't read the prices, and the names were just gibberish. My fingers were trembling, it felt really uncomfortable.

"Can I help you?" A girl stood in front of me with a note. 

I gave her my order, she thanked me politely and gave me a smile. "Where have you come from? Did you come all the way to try our food?"

"I've come from Rjukan(Something a bit more convincing)" I said. "And I came to find my friend"

The girl's eyes widened, "Really?" She left with my order then came back. "Is your friend pretty?"

"Yes" I said, "Very much so"

I sat still and looked out to the scenery. It was beautiful, too beautiful for someone like me to be sitting here. Now that I had come all the way here I really wanted to see Casey, I wanted to meet all of the friends I had made once more. But being so close made me nervous. What if things didn't go well? What if Casey had changed? Now I was afraid to ask.

"Here's your water" I looked up to see Casey.

She was holding a jug of water and poured it carefully, but her gaze was on me. I couldn't help staring , she was wearing a waiter uniform, light brown with a small apron on the front. And her hair was done up in a way I had never seen before.

We held gazes for a while.

"Kei, you really came"

"Is that a bad thing?" I suddenly saw her kissing Guizan right in front of me, both of them against the wall. I wiped the image to the back of my mind, but it kept pressing through.

"No, it's wonderful" she said. "How did you know I was here, did it take a long time?"

"I don't know how" I said, "It feels like a big coincidence, and if I left now to wander off again, I might never find you." 

The talk died away, her eyes looked back at me. She seemed so different to the Casey I knew, she was more mature and womanly.

"That lake" Casey said, "Across it, on the far side, is where we spawned into this game." Casey said. 

"Really?" I tilted my head to look out. I couldn't make out the far shore, but if that was where we started, it wasn't that far away.

"What have you been doing Kei?" she looked away, "After that meeting you disappeared"

"I went for a long walk" I said. 

"Did you enjoy it?" She corrected herself, "The long walk I mean"

I looked up to her. "I decided that I want to leave this world" I didn't know what she was going to say to that. Did she care?

The mood changed, Casey was still holding some plates and glasses. 

"Do you want to sit?" I pulled out a chair.

"I thought you were never going to ask" She sat down and wiped her hands on her apron. 

"It suits you here" I said, "You seem to be able to do what you really enjoy"

"It's really good, there's so many amazing chefs, and sometimes after work is over, they teach me how to cook new recipes, there are some limitations, some ingredients here that you can't buy anywhere else, but overall it's similar to the real world."

The conversation died out again. I didn't know what to say, everything I wanted to say sounded stupid, she was so much better than I was.

"Kei, you know, my friend Gloria, the other waitress just now, she told me that my boyfriend was here."

"Your boyfriend?" 

Casey blushed, "I don't know why they all think that, but they said that I talk about you all the time." She looked at me, "Sorry, I'll tell them to stop saying that, it's embarrassing for you and for me."

"I'm fine with it" I said. "I don't mind being your boyfriend Casey."

She blushed and laughed nervously. "Hahaha, you're funny, you don't know all the bad things about me." She picked up an empty plate and stood up. "Sorry, now I have to go" she said, "But can we talk later tonight?"

I told her I had nowhere else to go. After she left, the other girl, Gloria brought my food. She didn't mention anything about Casey but smiled when she saw me. "You know we are having a small party today, with fireworks. It's just something we decided on. If you would like to come, I'm sure Casey would love to have you there"

She served out the warm meal. 

"Thank you" I said, "Then I'll come"

Now that I was here though, things seemed different, Casey's life had changed a lot, maybe too much for us to get along. In the first place I only knew her by chance.

"Don't worry" Gloria said, "She really likes you." 

"How do you know?" I said. 

"I'm a woman, it's something I can tell" She put her hand on my shoulder, "But you can't tell her I said that okay?"

I nodded.

"Oh, you're so cute" she said, "I would kiss you if I wasn't such a good friend" She waved bye.

When Casey returned she wasn't wearing an apron, but jeans. It was closing time for the store, and she was shutting all of the windows and pulling down the blinds. "Come out back" she said, "We have a small party"

The staff were out back, huddled around a table, Gloria immediately handed me a firework. "We're all writing a wish on here" she said. "Than later we pull them open, and they burst into the air" she glared at one of the guys, "Don't you dare write the same message again, I've heard enough about them"

He raised his hands, "Whoa, I didn't write that last time"

"Yes it was" Gloria said. "Only you would do that" She pulled open a seat next to Casey and made me sit down. Everyone was busy writing their messages down on paper, then they stuffed them into the fireworks, apparently it would be written in the sky.

"What should I write Kei?" she said, "I don't know, can you help me?"

"I don't know either" I said, "Do we have to write something?"

"Yes" Casey pulled my sleeve, "We absolutely have to, it's really important" Then she scribbled something down on her note and folded it in half.

"What did you write?" I said.

"Nothing" Casey folded it again and put it on the table. She couldn't hold back a smile. 

"Is it good or bad?" I said.

"I can't tell you that, you'll find out tonight"

"Come on, please, I can't wait that long"

She giggles, "No, well it's... ...No I really can't tell you. Stop asking me!"

"Okay, it's good thing about me isn't it?"

"I didn't say that, it might not be about you"

"Then it's a bad thing about me"

"Cut it out you two" Gloria said "You're already taking Casey away from us, at least stop making me feel bad about myself for a while." She walked out of the room in a hurry.

"Is it good or bad?" 

"I can't tell you that"

"Come on, please, I can't wait that long"

She giggles, "No, well it's... ...No I really can't tell you. Stop asking me!"

"Okay, it's good news isn't it?"

"I didn't say that"

"Cut it out you two" The other waitress says "Taking Casey away from me is one thing, but at least stop making me feel bad about myself for a while."

Gloria came and squished herself in between us. "There, now talk"

We both sat at the table and stared at each other, I saw every movement of her hair, her eyelashes, and her fingers as they moved over the piece of paper as she wrote. And then Gloria moved into view.

"What are you looking at?" she said. "Just talk normally"

I sighed, I would do that then. "Casey" I said. "I'm thinking of leaving"

"Good" she said, "I'll come"

"Do you know what I'm talking about?" I said, "About where I want to leave to?"

Casey looked up at me, "You're going back to the real world right? I want to follow you back. I don't know if you have a way, or if it's just one of your wild guesses, but I'm thinking that there can't be any harm in me trying right?"

Gloria says "Where?"

"The real world" I said

"Oh, there" She crossed her arms, "You guys are talking too big, we're living here right now, with all of this around us. I don't understand"

"Shall we go and see the fireworks display? Casey stood up. Gloria followed her out. I walked behind them. Casey and Gloria were deep in conversation the whole time we were walking there. Then suddenly the backs of them were lit up by a ray of light. A moment later a sound exploded in the air and thousands of balls of light spread out. I looked in the sky to see a message 

I Love Amber

There was laughter coming from somewhere, I looked in front to see the girls, Casey had her hand on her mouth and laughing, Gloria was saying something and she held her stomach in laughter. Amber was someone they knew, and someone confessing to her was a surprise.

More and more fireworks hit the air, it started to smell of cinnamon. I followed Casey and Gloria, the girls looked back every now and then to see I was following, then continued on. They brought me to a small clearing with grass that came up to our ankles. The other staff members were sitting around and talking. A pile of the fireworks were laid in the middle.

They moved to open up some space and Casey sat down. Gloria pulled me down to sit behind her. "Kei" she said, "You know, Casey's actually really happy to have you here"
"Really?" I couldn't see it, she looked normal.

"She really wanted you to come and see this festival" she said, "She wrote her letter before anyone else. Knowing exactly what she wanted to say"

Casey glanced at me talking to Gloria, then she turned back to her friends.

"Her message is important" Gloria said, "Her and I tell each other everything, but I don't know what is in there" she said. 

Everyone gathered in the middle to release the next one. It was mine, I recognized it because of the wrapper it was in. They lit it up and scattered back, a moment later it shot off into the air. I saw Casey's cheeks and forehead shine up from the sparks, then it was dark again. Up above us I saw my familiar words light up.

"I get to see my friend again bu"

"What was that?" One of the guys said. "What's bu?"

"That was Kei's" another guy said, "I believe his message was cut off" He turned to me "What did it say?"

"Just about meeting a friend" I said. 

He grinned and sat down next to me. "You're lucky, I haven't seen my girlfriend in a while"

The next message was sent up, and then the next. Until finally Casey's was chosen, there were only a few more left. 

"Who's is this one?" One of the guys held it up. "Come on, admit it while you still can"

Casey raised her hand, she was embarrassed.

I felt a shiver run up my back, now I really wanted to know what was written in it as well. the burst of light coursed up the sky and flickered at the top, then it shook and burst into a thousand particles.

I need to have sex 

It flung through the sky with no shame.

Casey's mouth dropped open, all the guys pointed to her and laughed. 

"That's not mine!" she said, "I didn't write that, I promise"

"I didn't think Casey was so easy" one of the guys said, "I now see Casey basked in a new light"

Casey covered her face, "That wasn't me, it wasn't I would never..."

"It was Gloria's" The fingers pointed at Gloria. She stood tall and grinned, "So what? What are you going to do about it, Casey put hers in the wrong wrapping." But the festival stopped there, Gloria had attracted too much attention and laughter, besides, everyone was getting tired. Everyone started talking and laughing. 

Casey covered her face, "I made a big mistake" she said.

"It looks like we'll do the rest tomorrow" Gloria said, she went off to talk with the guys.
Casey was watching me from the other side. I walked over to her and sat down. Amidst the talking and shouting, we sat there silently, like two little lambs waiting for the chopping board.

I looked to my right, the guys were playing around with some weapons, Gloria was in the middle of them. Then I looked to my right, Casey looked at me from the corner of her eye, then tucked her knees under her arms and twirled a strand of hair that hadn't been tucked in.

I couldn't help looking, I felt invisible forces just somehow making me want to wrap my arms around her and hug her tight. So tight that nothing else around us mattered, nothing would ever get in and hurt her.

I stood at my limits, "I like you Casey" I didn't know if I was saying it because love was blossoming in the air everywhere around us, or because I felt that if I didn't mention it I might lose Casey, or because I hadn't seen Casey in such a long time, but I said it. 

I don't know how she reacted, if she was stunned, or if she laughed, or if she was annoyed; I didn't dare look.

"What?" she looked up from the ground, "Did you say something?"

"Nothing" I bit my lip and looked away.

"Okay." She smiled. "Do you want to say it again?"

She moved closer, wriggling her knees and legs towards me. "I'm listening"

I couldn't' say it anymore, not here, not in this world. It seemed that if I said it in this world, that I wanted to leave, then it would make it seem less important, it would be rude to Casey.

"Do you want to leave?" I said, "With me?" 

Casey breathed in sharply, "How about Richard and Elsie?"

"I don't know" I said, "They have gone their separate ways, I'm not sure if they still want to come"

"I'm going to go get them, we're going to get them" Casey said

"And then what?" I said, "I always talk about leaving and become unhappy when we're not able to, but actually Casey, I'm just a loser with delusions. No one knows how to leave, everyone says it's impossible, I don't know what to do."

I must have looked miserable, because Casey looked at me with eyes covered in sympathy and attention.

"You're not a loser" Casey said, "You can't be" She stroked my cheek with the back of a bony finger. Then she leaned her head where her finger had been 

"Because I still want to follow you"

We sat like that for a while, casey with her head on my cheek, and her warm body so close to mine. I wanted to put my arms around her, to tell her that we'd be out of here, we'd be going home soon. Having her there made me feel incredibly strong.

"I don't know" My voice was slow, but steady, "But I'm sure that if all of us get together we'll be able to 
do something"

"Kei" Casey said. 

"Hmm?"

"Do you remember how we met?"

"Yes I do" I said.

"Well do you remember the first thing I said to you?"

I thought about it then shook my head. "No, I don't know" It was too long ago. "Why do you ask? Do you remember what you said?"

"I do" she said, "It's what I wrote in my message"

"What is it?" I said. "You have to tell me now"

She smiled, "No, sorry, you have to remember it"

We fell silent again, but sitting there with Casey's head on my shoulder was the best.

"Do you think Elsie and Richard will want to come?" I said.

"Of course" Casey said, "They're a part of the Sparkling Dragons, they will come"

"But...I think maybe I was a bad influence for everyone. I think that after everyone left me, they seem to be much happier off."

Casey laughs and says she didn't know that guys thought so much about stuff too. She thought she was the only one. Then she gave me a serious answer, "Kei, I'm wanting to come back, I don't know why, and what for, but you make me want to follow you, just like an ancient king, you make me want to go back to you. Elsie and Richard are the same, we want to go back with you Kei" 

The other guys walked in, the main chef looked at the both of us with a frown on his face. "Sorry" Casey said, "I will get straight to work"

Behind him, the others all filed in. "You don't have to" he said, "Follow me, both of you" They walked out, the main chef stayed behind with Gloria, "There's a special table for you" he said to me.

Casey stood up. "Let's go" she said, "It's too small here." 

The chefs led me through the kitchen, there was a small curtain flipped across in and a jewel table was gazing up quietly. It was the only table that was set up with beautiful flowers decorating it. A petite fork and a big knife, a petite spoon and a big fork sat on the table like small dolls waiting to be played with.

"This is a table for two" he said. Gloria stood beside him and nodded her head with her arms crossed, agreeing with everything he said. "You get to taste some of Casey's food tonight, then you can see how much she has improved." There were cheers behind him, 

"Everyone's rooting for you two" Gloria whispered not-so-quietly. 
"It's a popular retirement area for people around here" The main chef said, then Gloria glared at him with eyes telling him not to say that. 

"Tonight is your night" Gloria said, "I've told Casey the same, so don't worry about anything, just enjoy yourselves" The two of them left and dropped the curtain behind them. I could hear them saying bye to Casey outside. With nothing to look at, my gaze wandered to the lightbulb hanging above me, the edges of it were tinted red, from the reflection off the curtain around me.

After a while the kitchen started up, and I sat alone. Finally Casey came back with a bottle of water in hand, she peeled the curtain open with the back of one hand "Would you like some water?" she said. 

"Sure, thanks"

"Here you go" she put it on the table, "You pour it yourself"

Talking about hospitality...Casey turned back "I, Casey, am not going to cook you the most delicious meal of your life" she said. "So you need to relax, sit down, you don't have to help me, I have to do it by myself for you"

"Okay"

She started speaking as she cooked, and smells started to stream through the air, like fresh perfume on a winters day.

"Are you listening?" she said.

"Yes, yes" I went over to see what she was cooking.

"You can't look" she brought out her hands and covered my eyes, "You can't" Her hands had spaghetti sauce on them, and they made my face feel like a Bolognaise. She covered my cheeks that it smeared down my eyes like Mascara. At least I knew what she was cooking.

I decided it was best to go back to the table. "Casey" I said. "When I got here, it was as if everyone knew me"

"Really?" Casey said, "I wonder why" A strong sound of something frying cracked through, then a new smell followed it moments later.

"You must have been talking about me to everyone" I said, "Quite a bit"

Casey laughed, I heard something in the kitchen drop, then get picked up. "Go on" she said, "Don't stop, I'm listening."

"When I got here, it was just a really nice atmosphere, the way everyone treated me, I felt like it wasn't my first time here."

"You know what?" Casey said, she was now steaming up something big, the air was becoming foggy and heavy. "The guys told me to come here and cook something for you tonight, I told them I didn't want to, but they said I should. So, you should thank them for tonight too. I shouldn't be telling you this, but when you came in, they all said that you were in love with me" Casey stopped cooking and turned to face me. "What do you think?" She stared, "Kei, why are you smiling? Are you interrupting me!!!!?"

It wasn't like I was trying to smile, I just couldn't help it. If I did like Casey, if I was in love with her, others would know. I didn't have to say anything, Casey understood. She also started smiling and beaming. "You're so immature" she said, "You know that? Stop smiling"

"I can't" I said. 

She couldn't either. She cooked the food, turning over the meat, and removing empty strands of hair from her vision with a big smile covering her lips.

"Everyone here is so kind" I said. Other people were seeing things in us that I had never seen. There was no reply from Casey, but I could hear all sorts of commotion from the kitchen.

"Did you say something?" Casey called out. "I'll be done in a second."

Half an hour later, the kitchen stove stopped and Casey peeled open the curtain with a huge dish in her hand. "Sorry, I looked out the kitchen and saw the guys decorating it, he was standing on a ladder above me, long after everyone else has gone home he's still decorating it for you"

"It's for me" I said, "I think it's for you, they reserved it for us"

Casey sat down and wiped her lips with a handkerchief. "You know you're really lucky to be able to taste my food?"

"I know" I said.

She served out her food, it was some kind of exotic spaghetti with a flowery smell. Then we said a prayer, and started eating.

"If someone is out there listening to us" Casey said, "Then I hope that we will be blessed with this meal. It doesn't have to happen, I'm just saying that I won't mind it if it did." Then she looked at me, and pulled my hands closed like hers were. Palms against palm. "And I hope that Kei and I will be able to leave this world, we have had our share of troubles as well, it would be an unbelievable help if we are able to leave this world."

She closed her eyes in meditation, then when her eyes opened, they were looking straight at me.

"So, Kei" she said. "How is this going to work?"

In between slurps of spaghetti, I managed to explain to Casey that I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea how the plan was going to play out, and I had no idea of what to do, and I had no idea.

Casey nodded, "That's all very well" she said, "But you realize that I'm following you right? And so are all these other people you've told me of, they're following you, so you have the responsibility. So it doesn't matter if you paint the world around us, but make sure we are happy with it."

I sank to look at the spaghetti, all of its textures and shapes.

"How's the food?" Casey said.

"Good"

"Good"

"To be honest" I said, "I have a plan in the back of my mind, I don't know if it will work, it probably won't work, and if it doesn't then we will lose all of our hard earned levels, but it's something I thoguht of"

"Great" Casey said, "Then let's do that, it's better than nothing"

I looked at Casey, "But you realize you might lose all of your cooking skills? For a whim of mine"

"But I might not right?" Casey said. "There's a possibility of leaving isn't there?" She slurped up an exceptionally long noodle. "Then I will do it"

"But don't you want to hear what it is?" I said. 

"I don't mind" Casey said, "It's probably better not to know anyway" I nodded, it was better not to know.

"I trust you Kei" she said. "Just like I did when I joined the Sparkling Dragons, now it is the same"

"But the Sparkling Dragons failed" I said, "Look at where everyone is now, I didn't do a good job"

"I don't think so" Casey said. "When Elsie left us, I don't know if she did it because she wanted to get with Hamish because she liked him, or because she felt left out travelling with the three of us, of maybe because she had different ambitions, and was too strong for us. I don't know, but in the end, she is still one of us"

But Casey pointed a finger at me, a polite finger of intimacy. "This time Kei, you are different, you have people who are relying on you, for something only you can do" She put her hand on mine. "Everything we've done up till now is play in comparison to this"

"I understand" I understood.

"You know Kei" Casey said. "You did an awesome job, that's what others told me after you left the Programmer's meeting, they asked me where you went. Where's Kei, where's Kei, some people said the best possible things about you. I think I was really lucky to have met you so early in the game."

"You know, this plan I thought of, the risk is really high, and it probably won't work" I said. "But do you still want to do it?'

Casey nodded, "Oon" 

Casey walked away to bring me some more food, her cooking had become amazing, I ate it and sat and looked at the scenery. I watched how it didn't change at all, it was constant, in this world nothing changed.

Casey came to check on how I was doing before heading back to the kitchen, "Is it alright, are you enjoying yourself?" she said.

"Don't worry" I said, "I love it here" I didn't want to worry Casey, she was expecting me here for a long time, she probably also wished me to enjoy myself. But I was afraid that she didnt' want to leave, she only wanted to follow me. It was probably better for her to stay here.

When she finally came and sat down, she brought three dishes with her, "I can't eat that much" I said.

"We have all the time in the world" she said. She leaned forward, "Go on, eat, you don't need to be polite"
"What did you cook?" I pulled the menu.

"It's not in there" she said, but she flipped it open. "But you know, I can cook this, and this, and this, and this" Her finger ran down the paper. She made me blindfold her eyes with my hand. Make sure I can't see anything" she said.

"I don't know" I said, "You're the one who is looking, not me"

Then she started ordering dishes, some of them were written on the menu, "I want one plate of seafood chowder, with generous butter on the side" she said. "Here's my wallet, take what you need" 

In this place where there was no one else around us, she bought the things she wanted, with no one to see them, and no one to price them. 

"How much is this one?" she said.

"It's really cheap" I said, "What a surprise, and with this quality as well, what a bargain." Casey giggled, which made it worth it.

"There's no one else here" Casey said, "In this store, so I'm just going to buy it now?"

"Go ahead" I said.

"You're supposed to stop me Kei" she said, "I can't buy it if the store owner doesn't allow it"

"He allowed it, I just asked him"

"Are you sure? Okay, then I'll buy it at this cashier, it was in the corner and was difficult to find, but now I'm buying it. Kei, what's his expression, the cashier man, what's he doing?"

"He's bored, staring into space" I said.

"This shop is so big" Casey said, "But there's no one here, and the cashier is placed in the corner, there's even an escalator running that goes up to another floor."

"Is there anyone there?"

"There's a kid and his mother there, but now they're gone" she said, "It's just us now, but now we;re leaving as well"

"Then there's no one?"

"There's the cashier man" she said, "Don't forget him"

"Right" I said. "But you know what? He has a strange feeling, after selling it to you really cheap, for a huge discount, he feels like nothing has changed, no one has lost anything, and no one has benefitted. The rest of the items are still there, left in their place."

"Right" Casey said. "Kei...you didn't have to say that, now I feel all weird"

We ate in silence for a bit, then both looked up to speak. 

"You go first" I said.

"No, you go first" she said.

"Okay then" I said. "Casey, do you think it was my fault that our group disintegrated?"

Casey rolled her eyes, "This again, how many times do I..."

"Sorry never mind" I said, "I didn't ask it"

"You better not ask me again" Casey growled like a bear. "You think too much about it. I thought girls were crazy, but you're worse"

"Is that a in a good way?" I said.

"It's worse" she said, "How can that be in a good way?"

Casey grabbed my hand with both of hers. I dropped the spoon in the soup. "Kei, I know my apology isn't worth anything, but I want to say this" She said, "I want to apologize for all that Elsie did to you, she wasn't very nice to you, maybe if she had never joined, all of us might have been better off. I know it's bad, but sometimes I wish that we never met her back then."

"Don't say that" I didn't want to hear it, Elsie was just...different. "Back then, we didn't know anything, and Elsie helped us get through that."

Casey's eyes widened, "Kei, you're so kind, can you find something good about everyone? Even me?"

"Elsie was just a little upset" I said.

"She was always singing" Casey said, "When she was walking ahead of us, she was singing quietly to herself, so quietly that I thought it was the wind and the insects."

"Really?"

"If she's so sad, then how does she even manage to sing? A truly sad person can't have the ability to talk" she said.

"Who said she couldn't sing?" I said. "No one said so"

Casey leaned over, "Yes, but..."

"I know now that she didn't mean it that way" I said. 

"If she said it, then there is no other way to mean it" she said, "I think, and that's why I wanted to apologize."

"Then thank you" I said. 

"Good" Casey said, "If someone gives you something, you should take it gracefully."

I finished the soup, Casey picked it up and took it to the kitchen. She had started to yawn since a while ago. 

We said goodnight. 

The next morning I took a long look at the restaurant, and turned to leave.
"Where do you think you're going?" Casey sat in front of me with her arms crossed. "I'm coming with you, did you forget?"

I looked at the ground, "Why" I said. Talking with Casey for so long last night made me feel so foolish now. I didn't deserve any of this. She was giving me too much credit. "Why are you following me?" I said.

Casey stared me, then pointed a finger, "Because when you walk for a long time, you forget to look around, I want you to look around, and see me every time."

"You thought about that for a while right?" I said.

"Yeah" She scratched her hair, "It didn't really come out right, but the point is..."

"Hurry up" I started walking, "Or you'll be left behind"

"Where are we going?" Casey said, "You're so nice"

"We're going to make the Sparkling Dragons" I said.

Casey grinned. 

"That's a good idea"

I stood at one of the respawn areas, here as well, a group of players were gathered. They were talking about what was happening.

"We're going to leave this world" Casey announced. "Anyone's welcome to join us" 

The guys burst out laughing, "How long have you been in this game? You should know by now"

"I've been here just as long as you have" she said, "And I'm telling you that we might be able to leave"

"Might!" the guys said, "She speaks so strongly based on a possibility"

"Well do you want to come?" Casey said, "When we leave, you're going to be the ones who feel bad for not joining in."

"I'm too old to believe in silly things" One guy said, another guy beside pushed him away, "Are you talking about going back to that world?" he said, "You mean the same world that we were thinking about right? That place where people always ignored each other and walked past senselessly? You mean that place where I had to sell my body to a company all day, and listen to the words of someone who had sold more of their body than I had, and get home too exhausted to take a shower and clean my dross off, or read bedtime stories to my kids? You mean that world?"

Casey looked at me, uncertainly. "I mean, the beautiful place where all of us belong, it's where what we do is meaningful and we can be of service."

The man grinned, he raised his hand over Casey and reached down to pluck a strand of her golden hair. "Go ahead, go back to that place" He sniffed her hair and exhaled deeply, eyes blinking like a broken traffic light. "We'd rather rid ourselves of your kind" he said, "The less the better"

Casey stood staring at him. She was frozen in shock, she didn't retract her hair.

"George, stop scaring her" Another guy came over and took the man called George back. "Sorry about him, he does that all the time, it's embarrassing for us too."

"It would be so much better if we could send all of the criminals that we saw into this place." That's what Casey told me later. We were sitting on a bench, Casey was out of place, and then she said those words. 

"Do you want to go back?" I said, "Do you want to go back to living with Gloria?" 

Casey shook her head, "I would love to Kei, but I can't because I made a promise to stick with you here, I can't back out now"

"I don't mind it" I said, "I want you to do whatever you feel makes you comfortable"

Casey looked at me. "I want to stay with you"

"Good" I said. "Because I'm going to do something a bit different now, don't get scared."

"What is it?" she said, "Why are you giving me your sword?"

"Attack me" I said. 

"Why?" Casey said. "This isn't funny"

"I need to do this to make everyone come" I said, "To communicate"

Casey dropped the sword, "You know I can't, that's unfair" she said. "You can't throw away your levels for that"

"I do" I said, "Come on, attack me"

"We worked so hard for those levels" she said, "I couldn't do it, throw away all of my levels."

"Only one of us needs to do it" I said, "So please"

"Kei" she said, "I can't Kei, I love you, I love you too much to, you're the only person who listens to me, who nods to all the stupid things I have to say, you're the only one who walk all the way across this world to pick me up. No one else would do that." There were salty drops coming down the corner of her eyes, and sticking to the tips of her hair, and waving to the big bad sun above us.

"What if I attack you" she said, "And you don't respawn? What if you never come back because of me?"

I walked over to her, she stuttered and looked away "I could never do that to you?"

I stood right in front of her, she became still, "You're too close, it makes me uncomfortable"

I was so close to her, I could see all of her blemishes, traces of acne from when she was a teenager, small holes in her ears from where other earrings used to be. Strands of white hair on her forehead, food stuck in the corners of her lips. Icky oil in the pores of her skin. The pink area of her eye had retorts of dirt that hadn't been washed out. Her eyelashes fell, looking down.

"I know I'm not pretty" she said.

I took her body and hugged her. I felt her anxiety and bravery, and so much more that I couldn't explain. She stood still against me, we stayed like that for a long time.

When I respawned, there was a small message note in front of me. I wrote my message carefully, it had to be understood by everyone. After it was submitted, I respawned out into the open. The blue sky arrived and the mountains grew. Then I saw a girl standing in front of me, she was looking around, unable to see me. Then she glanced at me again, she breathe heavily in relief.

When I found my voice I said, "What do you look so happy about?"

"Nothing" Casey said. 

"Did it work?" I said.

"You did very well" Casey said. "Good job"

"Are you commending me?" I said. "That might be a first from you"

"I'm just saying the truth" she said, "I read what you wrote there, and thought it was good, that's all"

"Well we'll see" I said. In the end, the message wasn't written for either of us, but for a lot of other peoples' eyes.

Casey sorted the items in her inventory around. I didn't, because I didn't have anything to sort. 

"How does it feel to be level 1?" she said.

"Bad" I said, "But I'm glad you're here with me"

Casey sighed, "You're too direct sometimes, a girl can't handle it" She looked over her shoulder, "Shall we get going?"

All the other level players saw one player leave with a girl who was much higher level than any of them. They all wished to be that player.

"Good luck!" one of them called out, "You said you were leaving right? I wish you best, I hope we never see you again"

"Never see you again"

"Hope to never see you again" they all started chanting behind us. I don't know why, maybe there was something in the way we were walking, maybe it was because Casey and I looked so happy. But all of the players saw hope in us.

Then one voice cracked through the rest.

"Kei" it said. I stopped in my steps to hear it clearly. For a while all I could hear was the chanting behind us, then it came, "Kei, Kei, wait" 

I had heard it before, Casey turned around to see who it was, then her eyes widened and her chin scribbled up. She ran over to me. When I turned around I saw Guizan, standing amongst all of the level one players, they were all chanting, and he was looking back at me, with a frown. He looked miserable. Above his head it rang clearly

Guizan -Level One.

I didn't know what to make of it. Guizan was always the stronger one that I looked up to, he was the one who had given me the dream to keep going when no one else had. He was the one I had been trying to impress. 

But now he stood behind me, barely visible amongst the large crowd. He didn't step forward, and some part of me didn't want him to come closer. He was embarrassed.

"What's he doing here?" Casey said, 

"He lost" I knew there was only one opponent that he could have lost to. Their wars had gotten stronger and stronger, now there was only one possible person who could have defeated him.

"Elsie" Guizan mouthed the words, but I knew what he was saying, even before he started speaking.

Elsie had become incredibly powerful.

Casey opened up the high score tab, the top ranked player was now not Lahoe, not Hamish, not Guizan, but Elsie. She had the mark of the green sword next to her name.

Casey walked past me. "We need to take care of him" she said. "Come"

She grabbed Guizan's hand and pulled him from the crowd, he groaned the whole way. He had fallen from a great height, and now he stood in front of us, worth nothing more than the slime on the side of the road.

"What happened" Casey pulled out some water, "Have some of this"

Guizan was spaced out, then he looked up at us and grinned, "She's a monster" he said. "A complete ruthless monster. I looked away for a second, because there were bystanders, civilians. Then when I looked back, there was a sword in me, and her eyebrows, they never moved at all. 

"Before" he said, "I saw her defeat Lahoe, and I made sure not to have the same fate face me. But I remember it really clearly, right before she defeated Lahoe, moments before he saw the light, he saw her. She held the sword against him and was talking to him, and he was nodding, agreeing to what she said. But I don't know what she said to him, what they were talking about." 

Guizan twiddled his fingers, "I didn't know, until she did the same with me, she held the sword against my belly button, and leaned forward and talked to me, and do you know what she was talking about?" Guizan looked up at me, "She was talking about you Kei. In those moments of glory, right before she became the strongest player in this world, she was thinking about you. Complaining to me about you. I couldn't' do anything, just nod and hope she didn't drop the sword."

"No she wasn't" Casey said, "She can't have, because I was"

"Elsie and me" I said, "We both want the same thing, but we can't stay together, she can't defeat me, and I can't defeat her. We want to achieve the same thing. It's a very strange thing"

"There's a difference" Guizan said, "Casey will fight her way to the other world, and you will run away"

"I'm not running" I said,

"I saw your message" Guizan said, "Everyone did, there's respawn areas all around us these days."

"What did Elsie think of it?" Casey said.

"I don't know, because she slashed it up too fast"

I grinned, that sounded like Elsie. 

"I worked so hard" Guizan said, "I climbed to the top, trying all sorts of strategies, making myself stronger everyday. But in the end, I was defeated by a fresh player like her. It's not fair. The weapons I developed, skills I hid from everyone couldn't do anything against her, it's like she was some a force, on a whole different level."

"You sound fine" Casey said.

Guizan looked around, "You know what they call these places now?" he said. "They call it a brothel. It changed form 'farmyard' to 'brothel' because all the players are going out to sell themselves cheaply. The high ranked players are the biggest whores, they will do anything to get more diamonds." Guizan laughed, "It's not what I said, I heard other players talking about it earlier. I heard that there was a player who had a hundred diamonds, then he kept wanting more and more, just to buy the most expensive item in the store, so that no one else could buy it. He defeated countless enemies, when other around him begegd to use his diamonds to buy essential items, he refused. Then one day an extremely strong player came along, and like he was clearing up snot on the street, he swung hsi sword and this player was defeated, the hundreds of diamonds were lost."

Guizan smiled, "I think that was me, I walked past a town once, and I got bad looks from the players there, so I went around clearing them up. One player dropped over a thousand diamonds. I took it as a Christmas present."

"But now you can't do that right?" Casey said, "Isn't it good to see things from down here now?"

"I've decided I'm going to replay this game" Guizan said. "If only you can help me defeat Elsie, then I will have no enemies in this world, it makes me feel bad to admit it, but she's the only one that I can't touch at all."

"You still want to restart?' Casey said, "Even after losing like that"

Guizan stood up, "You will never know" He dusted off his pants and looked at me, "I wish you luck Kei, both of you, on your way out of here. I'll come and see you before you leave." Then he walked off. The level one on his head was bobbing up and down like a beacon.

I looked at Casey, then at Guizan. Casey looked at me, "Don't worry" she said, "I've made my mistake, he's not my boyfriend here." She held my hand, "I'm sorry for hurting you Kei, I don't know what got over me, he was just so possessive and powerful that I couldn't break away."

"It's okay" I said. And it really was.

Casey and I made our way across the plains, going back towards Rjukan. When we reached the turnoff, Casey pointed which way to go.

"I hope everyone gathers" she said.

"Everyone will" I said.

"Do you think Guizan doesn't believe in us?" Casey said. "He doesn't believe that we will be able to leave"

"He does" I said, "He just doesn't know any better, all he knows is to level and become the strongest in this world, he will replay it for as long as it exists."

"It wasn't what I expected" Casey said, "I thought he would be the first to leave with us"

"Yeah" I said.

We got to the meeting point early, Casey found a spot she liked and told me to come and sit with her. "I'm done walking" she said, "Let's rest"

We talked about everything, about food, about skills, and about the weather. But we didn't mention the other world, it was so close, but I think we were both afraid that if we started talking about it and got our hopes up, then there would no option if....it didn't work.

"We're a legendary team" Casey said, "They say the team that got the legendary lime green sword is truly legendary, but I think we are, we've managed so much. You've forsaken your levels, to try and leave, and I've retorted my job."
 
"But you know what that means?" I said, "It means that we've given up our hopes of trying to unite this world. Trying to make every player back to level one." 

"It's not your fault" Casey said, "And if it worked, it wouldn't be because of you either, the programmers don't understand it. the top ranked players don't either, but it's something that needs to happen with everyone, you can't do just decide to do it one day and expect it to happen"

"Elsie is the strongest player now" Casey said, "Do you think she can do it?"

Elsie couldn't touch the hair on a cats butt.

"See?" Casey said, "No one has that kind of power, it's distributed equally through everyone. Not even Elsie."

"So this is the best choice?" I said.

Casey nodded, "This is the best choice"

I looked around us, up to the sky. If we were going to leave, it was coming up now. This was our chance.

But I had no idea what we were doing. Casey was smiling back at me, her hair was dangling in front of her face. I raised my hand to see her eyes properly.

"You're so cute" she said.

"Oh yeah?"

"You were just thinking that you had no idea how to leave weren't you?"

"I was" I said, "But you know what, I was also feeling nostalgic that everything is changing again."

"It's been changing since we got here" Casey said.
"But these changes happen so suddenly, no one really knows when, but before you know it, you are somewhere else with different people around you, and different people"

Casey started laughing, "Ah, you're so funny Kei, always so serious"

"What I'm saying is..."

"I know, I know" Casey said, "You want to stop these changes right? You want to slow them down." She was balanced on the bench, leaning back with her legs balancing forward.

"Right" I said. But hearing myself say this felt weird, because wasn't this world supposed to be the one that was unchanging and constant? When had this changed?

"Well, keep your thoughts" Casey pointed out, "Someone's coming"

Sure enough someone was...

Forty Nine:

So,....was that a long chapter, or a looooong chapter? Anyway thanks for getting to the end guys, the story is finally finally wrapping up. Basically, if my professor was reading it, it goes like..., everyone has strong ties, some are broken off, others are strengthened, but amidst this, the party prepares to change. Anyway, more is going to happen, and thank you once more for sticking with Kei and Casey, and the boys this far!!!!

The figure approaching was Una. She was wearing a different costume, not the programmer's uniforms that she was usually dressed in. She had petite pumps that glided over the sand, and a long robe that dangled behind her, caught in the wind.

"Is that Una?"

"Yeah" I said, had she come here because she wanted to leave? Did she read my message?

She had a smug smile on her that only grew as she came closer. When we were within hearing distance, she put her hands on her hips. "How are you going to leave?" she said.

"What?" she didn't even say hello.

She shut her eyes and frowned, then opened them, looking away. "How are you planning to leave?"

I walked over to her to hear her better. "Yes, we're leaving"

"I'm asking how" she said. "Can you tell me that?" The wind was howling around her, he rhands were still sitting on her hips, and her hair was horizontal in front of her, getting into her eyes and mouth.

I looked over at Casey, she came forward to my aid. "We don't know" she said.

"What about you Kei?" Una said, "What's your plan, in sending a message like that you must have a plan right?"

I shook my head. 

"Kei doesn't have a plan" Casey said.

Una looked past Casey at me, she rolled her eyes and turned around.
"Where are you going?" she said.

"Away" Una said. Now her clothing was dancing towards us, like a Haka on display of courage, to keep all of us outsiders away.

"Go" Casey pushed me, "You have to explain to her"

"But she's right" I said, "I don't have any plan, we don't have any plan"

Casey grunted, then she became upset really quickly, "Do you know how much trouble I've come to following you, I've left all of my friends behind, do you know how much trust Una had in coming here to find you? She's not the only one who read your message, you better man up and do something about it. A woman hates a man who makes promises he can't keep. You have to go and tell her why"

"Go" she said, "You have much more going for you than you think. That's why I'm here, and I'm not such a fool. Besides, she acts like that, but she wants you to stop her." 

I ran over to Una, fearing the distance that shrank between us. When I finally got touch of her, she didn't turn around.

"Una" I said, "Una stop"

"Why should I?" she said. "There's nothing for me with you"

"You don't understand, we're going to do something" I said, "We're going to try our best"

She turned around, and I was surprised by what I saw, there were tears covering her eyes, all the corners were filled up, and the overflow went down the side of her face.

"You're going to try your best with her?" she said.

Was this about Casey? "Casey's helping me, we're in this together" I looked back, Casey was sitting with her arms in her lap, watching us. 

"Guizan didn't follow you did he" Una said, "He didn't believe you could do it either"

"Then why did you come all this way?" I said. "If you're just going to leave"

"I came to look for Guizan" she said, "But clearly I came to the wrong place"

"But you wanted to leave" I said, "That's what you told me"

I saw the scene back at Rjukan, Una wanted me to kiss her but I didn't. I looked back at Casey, she was still sitting still, then she saw me and waved with one hand, the other still in her lap.

"I don't know how" I said, "But I will try my best, we will try our best, everyone who gathers together has a plan on leaving, you just have to believe it"

"Why are you stopping me?" Una said, "You don't need me right? You've got hundreds of other players to choose from, why do you want me?"

"Well..."

"It doesn't have to be me right?" Una said, "I knew it, then I won't bother."
She walked off into the gusting sand. I ran after her and turned her around, by now Casey was too far back to see clearly.

"I don't want you to be left behind" She was standing right in front of me, I could see her shivering in the cold, but she put up a face when she saw me. If she could just let go of her pride, then she might follow.

"I'm not yours to leave behind" she said, "You have someone else for that" She watched me, "I'm going to find Guizan" Then she crossed her arms, "Maybe not, he probably won't want to see me"

She walked off again, into deeper sand and deeper wind. 

"Then where are you going?" I called out.

She looked back for a fraction.

"Somewhere else"

Casey told me that Una was going to leave, no matter what we told her.

"Then why did you make me chase after her?" girls were weird.

"Because" Casey put a finger to her lips, "She would have wanted it" 

"For me to chase after her?"

Casey pouted, "And also, because it might make you realize how important you are to me"

I blushed. "I guess so"

Back at Rjukan I felt like something had developed between Una and me. But on seeing her this time, it felt like a distance had grown, I don't knwo where it came from, but the distances were pushed by some invisible force, closer and away, closer and away. And Una leaving so suddenly made me feel smaller than a rock swept in the giant sandstorm, landing in peoples' eyes. What if the other players who read my message and came over were like Una? What if they were also disappointed when they saw my lack of direction? 

Even Casey was working hard for me, but I didn't know if I could promise them anything.

"If you're sure of something, then it's not as worth doing" Casey said. "Because you don't know how it turns out, it makes it worth more" She grinned, "Kei, I'm sorry to not let you have any privacy"

We sat for a few days without anyone arriving, then on the next morning, a player walked up to us. He was huge, the biggest player I had ever seen. Around him were about ten other players, they had formed a team.

"I'm the current rank two player" he said, "I was rank three, but I was promoted" He grinned, and his huge armor creaked, every muscle in his body was connected. 

the name flashed, 

iio8 - Level 560

I had heard of him only in passing.  He was one of the strongest fighters, he was a guy on the side who was always sleeping. 

"I have extremely low confidence" he said, "Very very low"

"Have you come to attack us?" I said.

He laughed and heaved, then the others started laughing as well.

"Attack you guys? Do you see my level? I won't get anything from it, I came here to thank you"

"To thank me?"

"As I said, I have a very low confidence, cripplingly low. I was always asleep, because I could never beat the strongest player, Lahoe, so I decided to sleep to ease my pain. But then one day my teammates wake me up, and they're all excited, so I stood up, and they shook, because I made the ground tremble because I was so strong. Lahoe was defeated, so now I can finally have my turn at the top, and I won't let anyone get near, I'm going to be a ruthless tyrant."

"Okay..." Casey said. "So why are you here?"

One of the players around him spake, "The ruthless tyrant was sleeping through all of the wars, when he woke up, it had halfway started, so he decided to sleep a little longer"

iio8 rubbed his head, "And when I decided to sleep a little longer, I accidentally slept all day. Then when I woke up, I lived through all the wars and heard Lahoe was defeated, there's no better news than that." He gave us a thumbs up, and swung his sword in the air, "I haven't slept since, I'm too excited, I'm working everyday to get to the top. I'm too busy"

The player around him spake, "He was too busy to say bye to others, you should be honored that he is taking the time to speak to you"

"It has nothing to do with us what happens up there" I said.

"I heard that Elsie is coming here" he said. "Is that true? If she is coming, then it has everything to do with us."

"That's a lot" the other player said.

"I hope she does" I said. "I'm waiting for her here as well"

"Good" he said, "We shall sit here and wait for her with you"

For the next few days it was a lot more rowdy as iio8 and his team, eponymously called 'iio8' as well, trained around us. Whenever I looked at iio8, he winked at me and then yelled to his team for more training.

We sat and waited. iio8 Told us stories of what he saw,

"Elsie and Guizan and Lahoe duelled for three days and three nights. Finally, this new player, Elsie, came out as the winner. But she's green around the ears, I was sitting at the top for a long time, she doesn't know as much as I do."

"But you were asleep" Casey said. "How do you know this?"
"I wasn't dreaming" he said, 

"Thinking while sleeping" the player said. "Thinking of being at the top and looking down on everyone. That's the spirit of a true master."

We were watching iio8 train when one of iio8's men ran toward him and announced that someone was approaching from the left.

iio8 gripped his fists in glory, "Finally, Elsie has come to meet her fate"

I was already smiling when I turned to see them.

But it wasn't Elsie.

Fermol waved at me from far away, he was walking towards us with Jake. Jake was walking with his hands crossed and he barely nodded when he saw me.

"I'm so glad you're here" he said, "I was worried that we lost you" Fermol greeted Casey witht eh same enthusiasm, "Oh, Casey, I'm glad that you and Kei have finally got back together, you were really good for each other"

Casey beamed, "So did you read Kei's message?"

"It was written on the gravestone" Fermol said, "But without Jake's help, I never would have seen it. He pointed to it and said we should go."

"I didn't say that" Jake said, "I said it might be interesting...that's all" He looked away.

Jake wanted to leave more than anyone, I could sense it, that was why he had so much trouble giving me encouragement.

"So what are we doing?" Fermol said, "When are we leaving? How are you doing it?"

"It's not possible" Jake said. 

"Oh stop it, you're the one who insisted on us coming, now you're acting all shy around Kei"

"I'm not" Jake said.

Casey separated them and explained what we were doing.  "We're waiting for more people" she itched her ear, "In a healthy way of course"

Jake and Fermol spent the their time watching iio8 train, but Jake had all sorts of criticisms to say about them. "Hips too low, legs not moving fast enough, he'll never defeat anyone like that."

"He's the second strongest player" I said

"In the real world" Jake said, "He would be a carpenter, maybe an electrician. I can see it in the way he moves his legs and the intricate movements of his fingers. "

"How about you?" I said, "What were you? Apart from being a programmer what were you"

"I was a father" Jake said. He chuckled, "But I doubt I would still be a father if I went back, my kids have probably too old to care about a father now. I left them when they were small."
The wind bit into his teeth and he sucked his lip. "Anyway" he said, "I want to see my kids, that's why I joined you, and if there was any possibility of me seeing them again, then I'm taking it"

A few days later Casey and I were crouched down sipping some of her soup when laughing echoed down the horizon. We all gathered together to see more familiar faces.

"Suze?" Casey said. She walked to us with jazz hands and a huge smile, hiding behind her was Spaz.

"I'm so glad you're actually here, I thought we were going to be too late or something" she said. "But from the looks of it, you're just getting started." She showed us some of her new ideas on navigation, then asked where Richard was. 

"Him and Elsie aren't here yet" Casey said.

"Hmm, so you're waiting for them?"

"If they turn up, then we will know what to do" I said.

She retracted a long fingernail, then pointed it at me. "That was really brave of you" she said, "That's why Spaz and I came, the rest of the Super Earls are still fighting monsters somewhere, they didn't bother saying bye, because they didn't think it would work"

Suze talked the whole time, and asked me questions, but she never once asked me what my plan was. Maybe she already knew that I didn't know what I was doing, or maybe she had decided that she would follow along no matter what. Either way, it was a great feeling to see her face again. I could see that Casey was also enjoying it. She laughed a lot more, and went on walks with Suze.

Spaz was quiet, he never really talked much, but just enough to let us know that he was there. Without the Super Earls around him, he probably felt out of place. Suze tried her best to make him feel comfortable.

Every night now, the six of us, Fermol, Jake, Suze, Spaz, Casey and me gathered around a fire and we talked. We talked about anything that happened, Jake told us more stories of when he was designing the game, and sometimes about his children. Suze bragged about some new items she bought in the game, Casey cooked us food every night. In this world it was much easier to survive with nothing.

Then one day, as we were talking, I was lying back facing the sky, watching the clouds rise and fall, ebb and flow. I came upon an idea, something that seemed too good to be true. Something that would rip straight through this world, tear the curtain apart. When I realized what it meant, I started to tremble, and pulled my hair. My muscles felt too strong, my legs kicked the air into shreds.

"What are you doing again" Casey said, "You're weird"

 "I know now" I said, "I know how we can leave"

"Okay, okay" Casey said, "Tell us tomorrow, it's late already"

I fell quiet obediently.

The next day, I gathered everyone around to tell them what we were doing. But as I was talking, a metal clanking sound started to grow. We looked around, then Jake pointed under the medium sized sand dune that we had been staring at for days and days. Underneath were too figures. One was limping with a metal leg, it was Heron. And beside him, walking slowly with his pockets in his hands, looking timid, and knowledgeable, walking like a piece of paper on a windy day, was Richard.

"Richard" Casey said, "He's here" she grabbed my hand, "Richard's here!"

"Geez" Suze said, "You weren't that excited when we turned up, she held Spaz close and rubbed ehr chin against his clothes, "Were they?"

"It's Richard!" Spaz said. He grinned and went towards them.

Suze sat on the ground, "Everyone's so excited, ahhhhhh, I'm bored"

Heron walked up to us and told us how they had developed so much further into the engineering skill. And he was teaching Richard everything. Richard looked really happy, he greeted everyone warmly and said good things about them. Then finally he turned to Casey and me.

"Casey" he said, "You're absolutely amazing, I'm so glad I'm back here, I'm so glad that we're doing this together, I missed you guys." He hugged Casey, then turned to me. 

"Kei" he said, "What can I say, I came all the way here for you" 

I smiled "In the end, we're the sparkling dragons"

"But where' Elsie?" he said.

"She's the strongest player in the world" I said.

"Is she?" Richard looked impressed, "I don't know what she's doing but I hope she doesn't forget about us, just because we're old to her."

"Anyway, there's quite a big crowd, did they all see your message?" Richard put his hands on his hips and surveyed the crowd. Then he looked to me, "They're all here because of you" he said

"Casey helped me with all of this" I said.

"Yes, but mainly, they're here for you" he said, "I'm talking from experience, no matter where I went, there were small players who said they thought of leaving, but the next day they all came back to work, or went to the places they usually did. You're different, and everyone here has sensed it" he said.

I felt embarrassed, he was giving me too much credit.

"So what's the rest of the plan?" The others were demanding to know, Fermol jumped in and asked me to explain the rest of it. Everyone suddenly fell quiet and looked to me in expectation.

"Kei, you have to answer us now." Suze said, "How are we going to get out of here?"

I felt a huge lump in my throat, I was afraid that when I told them, they would all be disappointed and leave, desert me. Casey looked at me expectantly, she was so caring that I felt bad. 

"You have to tell us now" Fermol said, "Please"

"Do you remember way before?" I said. "I think there's a way to get out if we all work together."

"Is this about getting the sword and making everyone's levels equal?" Jake said, "Because I told you that it was impossible"

I shook my head, "It's not about that, it's about us flying out."

"Based on what? How do you know we can get out like that? Where are we going to fly from?"

"Remember when we entered this game?" I said. "How did we enter?"

"How did we enter?" Casey said,

"I remember" Richard said, "It was through the sky, falling down through the clouds, until we landed on the ground."

"Exactly" I said. "That's how"

"And?" Jake said.

"That's it" I said. 

"That's all?" Casey got it,  "And you want to risk all of our levels and skills for one of your whims?"

"Isn't that enough? What are skills and levels worth anymore? The lower level players are enjoying themselves much more than the higher level players"

"Sounds great" Richard stepped forward, "Anyone have any different ideas? Otherwise I say we support Kei"
 
"See, I told you Kei would know what to do" Casey gripped her fists and started to dance around.

Jake put a finger to his lips. "Hmm, maybe" He started analzying it. "Maybe there's a loophole in the system that we didn't realize, and hopefully Aloola also didn't realize it when she made the game.

"But you're missing the most important thing, how are we going to fly out?" Spaz said. "This is stupid, hundreds of players have thought of flying out, why are we all gathered for this? No one knows how to fly out, that's why we're stuck here."

Spaz looked around for an answer, then Richard stepped forward. 

"Im know a way" he said, "Under Heron's help, I've been immersing myself in the engineering skill, and it's probably more vast than any other skill. And we have been finding ways of soaring through the air, although there are no planes, by combining different things available in this world, it might be possible for us to make something like that"

Spaz looked to Richard, he didn't say anything more. Instead he looked up to the big sky above him, "How far up?" he said.

"At least as far up as we fell down" Jake said, "That is the border of this world, maybe, if we are lucky, Aloola didn't think of this loophole, although most game designers would make it an irretrievable system, so that you can go one way but not the other.

"It has to work" I said.

That night the talk was a lot more quiet, with Richard and Heron gathered with us, everyone talked less. But the prospects of leaving this world seemed more realistic now, we had a plan in front of us, it wasn't just all talk. And now that we had a plan, I also started to see allies in all sorts of places. Richard knew all about the world and the items in it, Casey had become unbelievably good at cooking, and Jake had programming knowledge. Everyone in our group brought something that they could contribute. Even Spaz, who had been quiet until now, was joyful and nice to be around.

"That's your talent" Casey said, "Kei, people all over the map who are willing to support us and help us grow. All because of your vision, and your sincerity. Others who I meet talk about us, the sparkling dragons. When they tell others their ambition of leaving, the others who were usually rude are also really supportive of us." Casey looked into the sky, "It's such a beautiful place to be right now, I'm so glad that Richard came, it makes us feel a little more complete doesn't it?"

"Don't worry, you're the force to call everyone together when the time comes."

Everyone went to bed, but Richard stayed up with me and Casey. His arms were bare, and he looked extremely well trained in the engineering skills. I didn't want to look up his level, I didn't want to judge him on that. 

"We're only missing Elsie now" Richard said. "I haven't seen her since that meeting"

"We broke up there" Casey said. 

"Yeah, it wasn't my cup of tea, and I don't think it was a very good place for us. But in the end, we're here now, back together." He put his arm on my shoulder, "You know what the last thing I said to the guys I knew was? Right before coming here?" 

"What was it?"

"I said I had to go, because I had a ride to catch, a ride with some special mates" 

"That's so sweet" Casey said, "It's like in one of the movies"

"I wonder what kind of movies people watch now" Richard said.

I couldn't think about it, I was too busy crying.

"Kei stop it" Richard said. "It makes me feel silly"

"Let him be" Casey said, "He's just a little stressed that's all"

"Did you think of that?" Richard said. "That plan"

"Its the first time I ever thought of anything." I said. I munched on my tears, and Casey rubbed my back. It felt so nostalgic to be like this again, even though we hadn't been apart for very long. But things were going to change again, nothing every really stayed still, I thought it did for a while, but it kept changing.

"I wasn't too confident about whether it would work or not" I said, "But when you guys came, I felt like anything was possible"

"It's called teamwork" Richard said, "You're a little late to realize it, but it's better late than never"

Casey smiled "Yup"

"We all weren't confident sometime" Richard said, "Although it feels like long ago, I told you guys, I tried to take my own life, because I was no good at games. I don't know much, I use a lot of self deprecating humour because I am low on confidence, ever since the number of people in the world increased, there is less confidence to go around the world.

Casey and I didn't laugh. Even if it was in the past, it was too brutal.

"No?" Richard moved his legs around, "Elsie would have laughed. "Then again, she probably wouldn't, she would only start laughing when the ambulance came to pick him up. She's morbid like that"

I didn't laugh, and Casey didn't laugh either. It felt good to know that Casey was on the same boat as me.

"Can I ask you a question?" Casey said, "This is me asking with a girl's curiosity. Richard, why do you like Elsie?"

Richard blushed, I couldn't see it, but I could hear him fidgeting and I could feel him thinking up something to say.

“Although I only met her in this game, yet I felt like I knew her really well.” Is Richard's answer to why he likes her.

I was surprised, because it's the same reason I would give if I were to be asked. Maybe she was someone that everyone felt like they knew well. 

"She's very reliable" Casey said, "I know that she will get something done if she says she will do it.

"Well, Richard" I said, "You need to do something to get her to notice you"

"I didn't miss this" Richard said, 

"What? Me?"

"This attitude of yours, like you're watching down on all of us from somewhere, I don't miss it"

"What?" where did this come from? 

Richard smiled, "Don't act like that, like you don't know what's happening, you always make Casey side with you, even when she doesn't want to." His tongue was moving like a snake out of water

I felt like tickling him to stop talking, maybe that would be enough..

"It's just a joke" he grinned, "It's the type of joke everyone says in the other world so you should get used to it, you won't last five minutes over there if you blow up at every small thing."

I still didn't think it was funny.

"But you got so upset at it" he said, "So maybe it's something you've thought about. Now Elsie's so powerful, she makes you look weaker right?"

"Kei doesn't think like that' Casey said.

"Yeah" Richard said, "I'm just trying to get you used to the other world. It's not such a nice place, reality is like that, it bites you in the balls."

Richard took out some things, "Instead of talking about that world, let me show you some really cool things that we can do now" He combined a piece of wood and some water to make paper.

"Is that paper?" Casey said, "I haven't seen paper in such a long time"

"That's not all" he said, "Heron and I have found how to make metals as well. The science in this world is so vast that anyone can fiddle with it." 

"Really?" Casey said, "So do they have planes?"

"Like I said" Richard said, "There are no planes as such, but it's really fascinating and there's all sorts of other things to make"

As I watched them talk, I saw how they had both developed so much. After Elsie left, the group disintegrated, but Richard went and became an excellent engineer, Casey's cooking melted away the mountainns, I wondered if we could work together and gather all of our contacts so that we could fly off  the highest mountain and into the sky.

Now I knew the answer to my question, it wasn't because of me that the group had dissipated, I wasn't important enough for that, everyone was doing so much more here than I was.

"I'm really glad to be here"

"I know" Casey said, "I can tell, you were beaming, and I was like 'oh, it's not day time yet!' "

"I was talking to Heron" Richard said, "He's a character, I told him I wanted to get out of this world, and one of my friends invited me for a trip. I told him that I hated all of this, nothing is reliable, I could lose all of my levels in an instant, if a powerful player decides to stop backing me, or other stronger players take them down. But then Heron said that there is nothing wrong here, and it's better than the real world." Richard grunted, "I was shocked that he said said this, when did he change so much?"

I opened my mouth, I had to tell him that I thought exactly the same thing, why didn't anyone want to go back? How were they so easily content?" 

Richard sighed, "I guess I'm a Sparkling Dragon after all."

"It's not something you can get rid of so easily" Casey said, "I'm proud of that"

The next player to arrive was one I vaguely remembered. Richard nudged me in the shoulder. "He looks different but you should recognize him."

Casey laughed, "Kei doesn't remember anything, he's always lost"

"I remember him" I said, "We spent three days waiting for them"

Sheila was walking towards us, his hair was still long, but now it looked filthy, and his gear was the basic. His level was the same as mine, level one.

"Hi" he raised his hand, "Surprised to see you all here" He grinned awkwardly. 

He came all the way here to see us, so there was nothing to be surprised about. He had come here for my message.

"I didn't think Sheila, the fifth strongest player would be here" Richard said.

"Huh?" Sheila blinked lazily, "What are you talking about?"

"You read the message" Casey said. "That's why you came right?"

"Oh yeah, I heard you guys were going to leave, I thought I'd come and check it out."

"No problem" Casey patted the ground next to her, "Come and take a seat"

Sheila slung his hair back and sat down. He looked around a few times, "When are we leaving?" he said.

"When we're ready" Casey said, "Sheila, were you stuck in the respawn areas?"

Sheila laughed, "Seriously, I'm Sheila, one of the strongest players here, I'm stronger than all of you, why would I be stuck"

"Your clothing" Casey pointed up and down his torso, "These rips, they're not amateur rips, they're made by extremely low level players."

Sheila sighed, "I may have been there for a while, but I'm not like them, so don't treat me like one of them."

I was glad to have Richard back, I missed hearing all of the stories, but I didn't miss Sheila. He had changed so much after losing his levels, losing the duel. 

"We won't treat you like one of them" Casey said, "We're all the same here, besides Kei is level one too"

I grinned and gave him a wave. He snorted and looked away. He obviously thought he was too good for us. 

A while later he crouched on all fours on the ground and started chanting something.

Richard explained, he said that Sheila was praying. It was a new form of incantation in this world, the low level players were frequently found to be praying to a Greater Being.

"Is it God?" Was God listening to us here? So far away from the real world, did He know we were here? Did it matter to Him?

"They pray to Aloola" Richard said.

"Aloola? Really?" I couldn't believe it "She's been raised to the status of a god in this world. That's how much people depend on her." Everyone had wishes, that never changed.

Casey laughed, and so did Richard, they both looked at each other about something they found funny.

"It's you" Casey said, "You never said 'people', you always called everyone 'players', but just now you said 'people', and we found that funny, you never would have said it before."

Sheila was still praying beside us, muttering quietly under his breath. Casey shook her head, "It's blasphemous to the real God"

"I feel like I have become a stronger person" I said, "I'm less afraid of things"
Casey nodded, "I don't really understand, but you definitely have changed Kei"

"You just nod to everything Casey" Richard said, "We've all changed, I realized that when I met you guys, I saw how I've also changed."

"How?" Casey said.

"I know we're in a game" Richard said, "Maybe that's really important, because now I know that something that is more true is out there, more true than all of this around us. And as long as I know that, I have to leave. No matter what I have right now. It's like a button was pressed, and now I have to get out."

We saw six figures in the distance. Casey counted them out carefully. "Can you guess who they are?" she said. Richard knew because of his navigation skills, but he hadn't met some of them before and couldn't describe them.

"It's Jenkins" I said, he was at the front, with a walking stick. Behind him was Warren, and Israel. Two more figures were behind them, but they were fuzzy to my eyes.

Jenkins smiled when I came closer, "I knew I'd see you again, but not like this"

I was really happy to see him. He gave me a big hug, "You look more alive" he pointed to Richard and Casey, "I wonder if it's these guys" 

"He can't get by without us" Richard said.

Casey shook her head, "We have to pull him all the way"

Jenkins burst out laughing, "That sounds like Kei!" He sat down beside us. "I knew you wanted to leave but I never thought you'd do it like this, it's so fashionable."

Warren and Israel stood behind Jenkins quietly. Then Laura caught up, she had been walking with Lahoe at the back. She looked at me quietly and made a small bow of the head.

"Who's that?" Casey said.

"She's a girl I met at Jenkin's place" I said.

Casey grinned and waved, "Hi, come on over"

Laura turned around and walked away. When Casey looked at me in confusion I could only shrug, "That's just how she is"

"Anyway" Jenkins said, "I guess everyone's been asking you, but what's your plan? There's quite a few people gathered here, I wonder what you're going to do"

Richard pointed up, "Up there" he said, "We're flying"

Jenkin's eyebrows popped up, "Up there? Like a plane?"

"Not a plane" Richard grinned, but we've found a way, and it's ready now.

It had been ready for the past few days. We all worked together on it, contributing something to it that we knew, Richard finally declared that it was flightworthy a few days ago, and since then we had been sitting on edge, wanting to fly out.

"We're just waiting for one person" Casey said.

"She's not coming" Jenkin's said. "She's the strongest player in this whoel world, she'sgot the lime green sword to take her out." Jenkins waved behind him, "I brought these guys here, they said they wanted to leave this world" 

Laura stepped forward and looked at me, "Is it okay if I come along?" she said. "Only if there's space"

"Laura" I said, "Remember, I told you if you wanted to leave you should come with us?"

"Yes" she said, "But I thought you might change your mind"

"Laura is it?" Richard said, "Kei's irresponsible, but when it comes to others, he is suddenly the most responsible person I know so don't worry about that."

Laura's eyes lit up like Christmas lights. Warren and Israel followed her towards us and also sat down next to Jenkins.

"But you're not coming?" I asked Jenkins.

"I'm too old to leave" Jenkin's said, "This is my home now"

"Okay"

"Actually" Jenkin's said, "I'm ashamed to admit this, but I'm actually afraid to leave, what if it fails and I lose all my levels, what if my children have forgotten about me? It's these lowly thoughts that occupy my mind when I think of leaving, so I've decided not to leave."

"I wanted to drink coffee with you at a cafe, looking out on the city" I said, "Then you can tell me more stories of things that happen to you."

"You make me sound more interesting than I am" Jenkin's mouth tilted, "Actually most people think that I'm just an old man who talks more than a woman"

"No way" I said, "You're not a woman"

iio8 interrupted us. "Is Elsie here?" he said, "Did she come with this group?"

"No" Casey said, "I'm sorry"

iio8's eyes widened, and he stared. "What are you doing here?"

We all looked to where he was looking, it was to the far side of the ground, beside Laura, Lahoe sat curled up like a friendly kitten. Laura was petting him gently, running her hand down his coat.

"What is he doing here?" iio8 glared at us. 

"He's leaving with us" I said.

"Lahoe" iio8 said, "What are you doing here?"
Lahoe looked up slowly, then looked back down, he didn't even know that he was being addressed. But iio8 fell silent, he was afraid that he might be attacked. 

"He won't attack right?" he said.

Lahoe was too obsessed with his own thoughts to know that something was happening. but to iio8, even with Lahoe's ranks and levels stripped bare, he was the same presence.

"Lahoe's my pet" Laura said. "He purrs really cutely"

He backed down. "He still looks deadly" iio8 said, "I can't fight Elsie if he's watching me."

A few minutes later iio8 gathered his men and left. They went somewhere else to train. Even after all this time, facing a tame Lahoe, iio8 felt powerless and humiliated.

"Good riddance" Suze said, "He was starting to get so annoying" Casey performed the formalities of introducing Suze and Spaz to Jenkins, and then night fell. We all sat around the fire once more. Jenkins told us more stories, and Casey cooked us an amazing meal. 

When Jenkin's and I had some peace, I asked him, "Do you think Aloola knows about us?"  

"She probably does" he said. "But she probably doesn't care"

"Why"

"Because she thinks you won't be able to leave"

"But does she know what we are trying to do?"

"I don't know" Jenkin's said, "But some players see her as a god, as beyond a human entity. Doesn't that mean that she also will care less about us?"

"Not necessarily" I said.

"Yeah" Old Man Jenkins grinned, "Yeah, never mind"

Suze came over, "I know who we're waiting for now" she said, "We're waiting for the girl with the blue rubber band on her leg right?"

I was stuck for words, but Casey answered for me, "Yes, we are. But we know her as Elsie."

"Oh I'm sorry, I just noticed it because it wasn't from this world, when she turned to leave, it was really evident."

Casey rubbed my back, "I never saw it either, but everyone was telling me that Elsie was the girl with the blue rubber band on her leg, it's what everyone saw."

The next day, Guizan arrived. He was standing in front of me with a grin. "I heard you talked to Una" he said.

"Did I say something wrong?" I picked up my armor to put it on.

"I told her she should with you" he said. "Then she got mad at me and said that I shouldn't think that even for a moment, do you know why she would say that?"

"I think she doesn't like Casey" I said.

"She doesn't like a lot of things" he said, "But I try to give her more of the things she does like, that's what I promised myself to do when I first got together with her."

"Do you really like her?" I said.

"Not really" he said, "But she needs me, so I've got to be there for her."

"Are you coming with us?" I said.

He looked around, "I'm getting out of here before others start wake up and see me, but I jsut wanetd to say goodbye, and good luck. It's not easy to get out, but you have to go, because I bragged to everyone how there was going to someone coming to pick my friends up. So I would say bye to them properly" Guizan looked at me with a kindness in his eyes, "Una isn't going to follow you Kei, I'm chasing her. You know how some players just follow others around? Well that's what I am to Una, I'm her think skinny helpless puppy. But she respects me as well, it's kind of complicated." He reached out, "What I wanted to tell you is that I'm glad I met you, you've been a good friend." He reached out to hold my hand with his other arm as well.

"I've got so much I need to do" he said, "So busy, maybe next time, I'll see you then"

Guzian was talking as if it was certain we would leave. But it wasn't certain, actually it was incredibly risky, it hadn't been done before, and we were experimenting with everything, hoping that it would work, who knew if the sky would be a border we could leave out of? We could just fall back down and end up here again.

Yet Guizan was standing before me, he was level eleven, and probably the most likely to challenge Elsie. Was that what he wanted to do?

Guizan let go of my hand. "I'm just another boring person" he said, "I won't fit in over there" He smiled and walked backwards away from me, then he suddenly turned and ran, like a bullet in a windstorm, like a warm woolen coat half soaked in a pile of water.

I realized that I had to wipe my eyes, they were wet, it was so early in the morning, but it didn't matter what time of day it was. Words were still powerful.

That day was the day all of us worked together and brought out the final product, everyone had contributed to some part of it. Richard designed the main frame with metal, then Heron found balloons to make it float. The balloons

### Chapter Forty Nine

We're almost there guys, just around a corner. Now I promise that this one won't be as long as the previous ones, everything is in place now, once the last puzzle piece lands, then it's BUSINESS for our players, soon to become people!!!!!!!HEHEHEHE Thanks for reading as usual!!!! There's a change in the tone, my mood also changed, so forgive me for that, but hehehehehehehe!!!!! Let's get into it! Kei and crew are FINALLY going to leave!!!!

That day was the day all of us worked together and brought out the final product, everyone had contributed to some part of it. Richard designed the main frame with metal, then Heron found balloons to make it float. The balloons were made from the rubber of the bow and arrows. The engine was made of all sorts of metals by Heron, and Casey grouped them all together with a glue she made from cooking equipment. Suze made the navigation system that would tell us how high we were, and Spaz made it point in the right direction. Finally, I put fireworks in the bottom, which would help us launch to the top. The fireworks were leftovers from what Casey and I got from her restaurant.

 "It looks good" Richard said, he was standing with his hands on his hips, admiring the creation. 

"Will it fly?" Casey said.

Jenkins also admired it, "Wow, you guys did a huge job, it looks like a huge pile of junk but I bet it can fly."

"It will fly" Richard said, "The only problem is if it will get high enough"

"High enough for what?" I said.

"We need to reach the border where we were, we can't run out of fuel halfway through, but if we put on too much fuel, then it will cost too much to fly up."

"Basically, it has to be really precise" Heron said, "That's what makes this fun"

"Fun?" Casey said, "This is going to decide if we can get back or not"

"Here's something special" Heron brought in something familiar, "Casey brought fireworks in, and we designed something to make it go a bit higher, if it gets past the height and leaves this world, then it should disappear right?

I nodded, "It should, but what if it doesn't?"

Heron asked Richard to gather everyone around, "We're going to do this experiment" he said. He demonstrated what should happen, Fermol was impressed, "This might actually work"

"If it doesn't disappear" Heron said, "It might mean that inanimate objects can't leave this world, or else it could mean that there is no loophole up there"

He took a little note and wrote his name on it. "Write something you want passed on to the next world, if it goes through then we can assume that someone is going to read it"

This was moving so fast but I wrote my name and signed it. After we had all written something, Heron filled it in with "Dear Whomever receives this letter, we are people who became stuck in this game in year/month/day if you receive this letter, please write something down on it and send it back. 
Thank you.

We all stood in a circle around the firework, I stared up into the blue sky wondering how long it stretched, wondering how small each pixel was, wondering how long I would need to wait. Then the firework came into view, it soared up higher and higher until I couldn't see it anymore, Fermol pointed to it as it went up, "It's there can you guys see it?" By the end we all agreed that Fermol was just staring at a black pixel in the sky.

Then there was no response.

"Doesn't the rocket come falling down if it didn't go anywhere?" Suze said.

"Maybe" Heron said, "It's my first time doing this, I don't know either"

"It might have exploded, at an altitude" Richard said.
"Maybe" Heron said.

Fermol began tidying up the equipment, and a few of us set up the fire. Had the rocket worked? Did it mean anything had gone through? Or had it just disappeared?

Jake was the first to point it out "Look up there" he said. "It's like snow"

It took me a while to find it, but it was a piece of paper fluttering down slowly, blown about by the wind. 

"Is that the whole rocket?" Heron said, "Maybe it fell back down"

"It's just the paper" Jake said, "It's just the paper!" 

Against the backdrop of the deep blue sky, with lighter blue on the sides, the parchment drifted down like a feather, twisting and turning. 

"It's so beautiful" Casey said. 

"It's not a time to be admiring it's beauty" Richard said, "Is it the same message?"

We all scrambled to grab it, like a bridesmaid grabbing for the bouquet. Like a batter grabbing the homer. We dived on it like a group of hardened rugby players at a scrum. 

Jenkins emerged as the winner. he handed it over to Heron through the gap in hands.

Heron opened it and became pale.

"Is that good pale or bad pale?" Suze said, "Show me!" She tried to snatch it, but Casey was faster, 'i'm reading it first"

Heron fell to the ground, with short exhales of relief.

"What is it?" Fermol said, "What does it say" 

Casey's knees hit the ground like a Geisha serving tea.

"It's an answer" he said, "From someone"

"From who"

"We don't know them"

It took a while for us to register that there were people we didn't know. 

"Someone outside"

Suze read the letter to us.

HQ representative, Brick Gaming. 

"Thats a reply" Fermol said, "It even says our names on it"

"Not mine" Jake said.

Heron burst into tears, "I can't believe it, we're actually going to leave, someone answered us, they saw us. I thought it was just a hope until now, but it's real."

Casey re-read the letter over and over, until she couldn't read it because her eyes had clouded up. "Mum wrote to me" she said, "I hope she gets this reply"

I stared at the blue sky in gratitude, my eyes were kinder and the distance felt shorter.

Now all we had to do was get up there.

That night it was quiet around the fire. A sipping anticipation had crept into us. What if this didn't work, for me what was scary wasn't losing levels, I had lost everything. What was truly scary was that others might be disappointed in me for taking them this far and yielding no results.

And also not being able to leave.

I looked up into the sky, and I whispered to someone, "If you're listening, can you please let us get out of here, we've been here for such a long time, and I miss my family, and they miss me as well. It's too cruel to keep us in this place for this long, unable to do anything substantial."

That made me feel better. Now I knew why the other players did this. I guess it was prayer.

Suze was the first to speak up and break the silence. "Spaz and I have known the Sparkling Dragons for a while" she said, "But yet we only met them for a few days, and in coming here I've met so many more of you guys just a few days ago. But I feel like we really understand each other, and everyone helps each other out, we made an amazing machine together. That's not something done by a collection of strangers." Then she said, "Some players are just sick, and cannot cooperate with them, but you guys are fine"  

I sighed, did that mean that some others we met weren't good enough for her?

"What kind of players are those?" Spaz said. "How come I don't know about that?"

"You don't have to know about everything?" Suze said, "I have some privacy too you know. I know what you guys think when you see girls, you're thinking, 'Oh Suze, she's probably slept with a lot of guys already.' But you know what you guys? Not a single girl in this world has become pregnant"

"So is that a good thing?" I said.

Suze leaned back and put her hand on her cheek, "Umm...I'm not sure, it's good, but it also makes this world very artificial. The most beautiful thing in our lives is absent here"

"So what are you trying to say?" Spaz said, 

"Not a single girl has celebrated their birthday either."
"Do you want us to celebrate yours?" I said, "We can go around in a circle and sing everyone happy birthday"

"No, don't do that" Suze smiled, "No way. What I wanted you to realize is that I'm indecisive. It wasn't my decision to come here, it was Spaz's he pulled me along. But not celebrating my birthday, not being able to do really great things in this world, yet staying here forever, it let me see that our lives are short, and that our real world, the one we're supposed to be in, is transient, very short. And if I blink too many times, or drink too many sodas, crack too many jokes, then I might miss the opportunity to go back, because it will be gone. The world as we know it will have passed." She sighed, "I've always been indecisive, I thought it was because I placed too much importance on my life, but it might just be because I'm ignorant"

"Sorry" she said, "I just changed the mood with my ranting"

Heron spoke next, "Well since it looks like we're confessing, I feel really lucky to be able to contribute to something in this group, I love to learn about the sciences, and in this world I'm able to put it to good use, if this is done, then I feel like I can go back in peace."

"You guys are a great bunch" Old Man Jenkin's said, "It's not very often that a group gets together to do something and it is actually done. And it's not very often that the thing they created is of high quality. And it's not very often that the thing will change their minds. But even more, it's even less often that this thing will change the minds of those around them." Jenkin's fell silent, "You guys changed my mind about this world"

I opened my mouth to speak, but Warren spoke first, it was one of the few instances he spoke, and it took me a while to get used to his voice. "I don't know if this is the same tone as you guys" he said, "But I have very low confidence, cripplingly low confidence." he said, "I find myself copying everyone around me and following what I see because I don't know how I should be." His head sunk, "To make me admit this, is really difficult for me" There was nothing more truthful that he could say. "For me to admit this, they need to be my really good friend who I respect a lot" he said. 

"Don't worry" Casey said, "We respect you too Warren."

I felt weird though, while he was confessing this, I didn't think that I had done anything to deserve his respects. Warren's declaration changed the mood, even the fire looked a little brighter than it had been. Or maybe it was just that everything around it had become darker.

"I don't talk much" I said, "Because I can't find the words I want to say a lot of the time, and I like other peoples' words" I knew everyone was listening, although there was no sound, the air was receptive. "When I came into this game with Richard, Casey, and Elsie, I heard about everyone being level 1 together being able to restart the game. And then I thought we had an answer, but as we travelled around, it only became clearer that we were progressing further and further away from that goal, and it was getting harder and harder to achieve. So by attempting to leave like this, I feel is running away from the problem, and is a bit dishonest."

"Kei, you're so honest" Casey said, "You can afford to not be so honest once, just this once"

I felt tears welling up in my eyes, all this time I had seen other laugh, and others cry, now it was happening to me. "I thought we could all trust each other, players from all sorts of different background all working together to leave this world, but as we lived here, as lied to ourselves here I saw that it just won't happen, there will always be people fighting for glory and power, and the dishonest people who will take advantage of others' weaknesses. If we tried to do it, it would fail. When we tried, it failed."

"So, what I'm trying to say is" I wiped my eyes, and breathed out a few times to try and speak normally, my chin was quivering, but I held it back with all I could. "What I'm trying to say is, I want to apologize to all of you" The words came out like rocks falling tumbling off a waterfall, not like silky water that danced it's way into everyone's thoughts. I hoped they knew what I wanted to say, for some reason it was really important that they understood me. "I'm sorry that I wasn't able to do that, and now we are resorting to a last chance."

"Kei" Richard said, "Everyone here sees that you're a person" he said, "Not a player. That's why we're all here, because we've been inspired by you. When I saw your message on that gravestone I was overjoyed, I didn't really act that way because of all sorts of reasons, but when I got here and saw everyone here, it was really really awesome, like Jenkin's said, it's not often that we find something like this." He went on, "Everyone here knows that you gave up all of your levels and skills to try and gather everyone together one last time. We've all had enough of this deathlessness, it's completely different to life as we know it"

The others nodded, I don't know how I managed to hold any tears back, later Casey would tell me that i looked really funny, constipated even.

"But I have to let you know" Richard said, "You didn't do it properly, when you mark the gravestones, your name is supposed to be at the start, not at the end, it's not a letter"

"Okay"

Everyone laughed, 

"Although there were arguments and complaints along the way, everyone became best friends in the end" Richard said. "I'm glad to be working and in this game with you guys. This team couldn't have been any better"

"Let me speak" Casey said, "I feel like I know what I'm doing now" her voice was even softer than usual, it seemed to curl around the edges. "When I'm here, I feel like we're all able to express ourselves much better, like what Suze said, I think we ......(Make this a bit better, she is able to cook?"

Then Laura spoke, at first she was so quiet that half of what she said was drowned out by the crackling of the fire, but then she realized and began to speak louder. "People used to say I was really awkward" she said, "That's why I came into this game, because I thought that if people couldn't see me, what I really looked like, then I could be myself. But then after the introductions and people began to make friends, I saw myself excluded again, and realized that it wasn't how I looked, it was just me, I'm just not a good person" she said. But she smiled and moved her hair out of her eyes, "But here I feel at home, that's why I want to leave because I have found somewhere I can be again. I was really glad when all of you welcomed me into here with you guys, I didn't want to upset anyone."

"You haven't upset anyone" Heron said. "We're glad to have you here as well"

Laura had organized everyone's activities. It was what she did to connect to others.

"You're up" Suze nudged Spaz in the hip. "Say something like I said"

"Me?" he said, "I'll pass"

"You have to say something" I said. 

Spaz sighed, "Fine, but this is kind of cheesy, but you know that there were hunters on the summit of the mountain when we were watching Guizan's duel with Sheila"

Sheila shrunk and looked to the ground, Guizan laughed and rubbed his palms together, eager to hear the rest. 

"I remember those hunters" Spaz said, "They jumped on Guizan, but they couldn't land a single hit, their captain ran in to lead the charge, and they all backed him up. At least that was the plan, but Guizan was too strong, and he defeated all of them easily.

"It was a special skill, cool right?" Guizan grinned "Sorry for interrupting, go on"

Spaz looked at the fire the words came slowly to his lips, "They had an agreement that they would back up their Captain no matter what happened. And they actually all did without hesitation. Except, I saw a doubt in the last hunter who jumped in, by the time he went in, he saw his captain fall already, defeated, and the second player was about to be defeated as well. I saw a look of doubt on his lips, and he looked at me briefly, as if wanting to switch places with me, he still ran in, even when he knew it would be useless." He broke out of his gaze of the fire, "It's just that sitting here listening to everyone's stories reminded me of that one hunter in that one moment." he said "I don't know why, but it's probably important"

The fire crackled after Spaz stopped speaking it grew smaller as the night fell deeper and the air bit into us a little colder. 

Jake was next, he started off slowly then ran into a roller coaster of tonalities, "I was involved with four others, we were all so proud of our work, we knew it would change the world, we knew everyone would be amazed and impressed." He shook his head, "But with our power, we didn't change the world. I felt bad about it when I entered the game, I went to find the sword to do good, but in the end we never found it, they were just very strong. I just really want to see my kids again."

Guizan spoke, "I don't have much to say, but I want to repeat a story I heard from Jenkin's here, he told me about something someone told him. Do you mind if I say it?" 

Jenkins' outspread his palm, "Go ahead, share it"
How does this story relate? It's just weird?
He feels invisible when she visits, private life, but also empowering at having control over a mature settled in woman who has so much at risk.
Woman reaches an older age and wants to catch as many men as possible, the goddess who is nearing the end of her life wants legs/breast to wrap around the world.
(Guizan tells him this story after he is defeated, and he dislikes Elsie afterwards and tells him to kick her from the party. Looks at him, "You know you're not good right?")

Everyone spoke, and I saw how even among these few people here, each of us had different goals and reasons for being here. Yet for now, we were all really welcome.

Now there was only one piece of the puzzle missing, it's Elsie, who is supposed to join them."



And then, when we woke up the next morning, it had snowed again. It was a beautiful snow, but also very cold. Casey's cheeks were red, she was covered in a thick plump jacket. "What do you think?" she said, "Do I look fat?"

"No" I said.

 "I'm thinking about what to wear when we get back" she said, "And I hope I haven't put on weight" 

"You're always skinny" I said.

"Thanks" she said, "But you haven't seen me after I go binge eating fast food"

"You're still beautiful" I said.

"You're too kind, Kei"

I didn't know if the snow was good or bad.

Richard announced that the snow was too thick to be able to leave safely from the mountaintops, he said we would have to wait. We sat in the same spot day after day, but the snow only got heavier. Casey still wore her jacket the same way everyday, and every morning I collected twigs and branches to use for a fire, then in the evening started it. That was my job now. Heron cleaned the machine every night, "Tomorrow" he looked at the vast sky, "We're going to be able to fly out tomorrow"

I didn't know if the snow was good or bad.

Then one morning we woke up, there was no snow outside, the mountaintops were clear, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Even the sun was poking out.

"This is the day" Heron said. "We're going to try it out now"

I gulped in anticipation. This was it, it had to work or else...there was no else, this had to work.

Richard showed us the standing arrangements he organized by weight. We all stood in the body as the engine started and moved up. "It's going to get pretty cold, so wear a lot" he said, "We don't know how long it will take to get up there with this weight..."

"Why are you looking at me?' Casey said.

Richard went on, "It could take a few minutes, or worst case scenario it might take days. But we've tried to prepare ourselves for anything that might come."

"A few days?" Fermol said, "It's not easy to leave, huh"

"Who said it was easy?"

Then we all started to put the equipment on, hand-made sweaters from Suze and Jake. Sheila made some earmuffs for everyone. They were badly crafted, mine had holes that let the wind swish onto my freezing earhole.

"We're going up one by one" Richard said, "Make sure you wear you equipment properly"

"Who's going up first?" 
"Me" Jake said. He already had the gear on. Richard strapped the firework to him and he soared up. He yelled out as he went up "Goodbye everyone"

We all watched to see how far he went, then he was swallowed up by the blueness.

"Did it work?" Suze said. 

"Yes" Richard said. He showed us the map, Jake wasn't on it, his name was flashing with a new status. 

Jake Level 78 - Offline

Everyone cheered. Jake had confirmed that it worked. 

"The real world is right there" Casey pointed up, "It's so close"

"It is isn't it"

Suze was the next one, she also flew up. But her firework had a message of its own. It burst into the sky

"Did you get that?" Casey said, "That was my message, the one from the restaurant, the first thing I ever said to you"

"I got it" I said. "I know" It got mixed up, but it had gone off with Suze's firework.

Suze also disappeared into the sky. I wondered if I would ever see her again. Would we meet in the real world? Fermol opened up his tab to show us that Suze was also offline now. She was finally resting.

"Good" Casey said. "Then I'm going to go next."

"Right now?" I said.

"Yes" she put the helmet and the earmuffs on, wrapping herself with a scarf, and tied up her hair. She lit the firework, then waved goodbye to everyone. "See you everyone, I had a really really great time..."

She was launched up mid-sentence, I saw the maroon of her scarf against the sky, then she also disappeared out of sight.

"Who's next?" Richard said.

Fermol went up, he said his thanks to everyone, then was followed by Sheila. Sheila didn't say a word, he just strapped everything on, then Richard lit the firework and he was off.

"Send these guys on their way" Jenkins pointed to Lahoe, Warren, and Israel. 

Richard helped Lahoe put everything on, then he positioned the firework and lit it up. "Goodbye Lahoe" he said. Lahoe looked like he was sleeping, his head nodded up and down. Then his eyes opened suddenly and looked around when he was swept up. He waved once or twice midway up in the air.

"I can't believe that he was the strongest player" Guizan said. "He's just like a child"

"That's what fear and glory does to people" I said.

"Maybe so" Guizan said.

Richard cried out for the next ones, Warren was next. He held Israel's hand right until the moment he was released. He looked down quietly at Israel the whole way. Israel was practically begging to go next, so Heron set her up. Then she also flew up. She only looked up, as if by gazing hard enough she could catch up to Warren.

Everyone had made friends, some were closer than others, but a lot of feelings were tying everyone together.

I looked around, now there were only half of us left. Guizan, Richard, Jenkin's, Laura, Spaz, and Heron

Spaz came forward. "I have to admit Kei, when I first saw your message I didn't believe it at all. Leaving this world had already become impossible to me, but Suze begged me to come along, she said that if it was you, you would make it work. That you were worth investing our trust in."

"She said that?" That was so touching from her.

"And now that I'm here, and looking at how small our group has become, I'm overjoyed to be here. Thank you Kei, thank you everyone."

He shouted thank you halfway up, then was gone.

Laura was next, she turned to me. "Kei, this is kind of selfish of me, but when I saw you and Casey together, I had something to tell you. But now, I realize that I won't say anything about it anymore."

"Okay" I said. I knew that she meant something else, and to her it was very important. Laura smiled and realized I knew what she meant. Then she obediently put her equipment on and thanked Richard politely when he lit up the firework and positioned it. 

That was Laura, gone.

Now it was only Guizan, Richard, Heron, Jenkins and me left. 

Guizan left quickly, he grinned at me, as if he was on a car ride. "I enjoyed it" he said.

"Do you want to go next?" Richard asked Jenkins.

"You go first" Jenkins said, "I've been waiting all my life, I can wait a little longer"

"Then I will go" Heron grinned cheekily and jumped into the gear. "It was nice working with you" he said to Richard, "I hope we can meet over there as well"

"We will" Richard said. He lit the firework, it didn't light properly, it took about three tries for it to work.

"Don't get all teary on me already" Heron said, "You've still got to leave as well"

"Yeah" Richard said.

When Heron was gone, Richard turned to Jenkin's and me. "You guys, I realized I made a huge mistake"

"How are you going to leave, am I right?" Jenkin's said. "You need to light someone else's firework and position it, you need someone else to be there.

"Can't we try to go together?" I said, "What if we try to start each other's at the same time?"

Richard fell to the ground, "I miscalculated" he said. "Heron would know, he made most of this"

Heron had only just left.

"I'll stay behind" Jenkin's said.

We both looked at him. "No, I'll find a way" Richard said. "We can all leave"

"Could we ask one of the level one players to do it for us?"

"I'll do it" Jenkin's said, "I don't mind"

Richard's eyes fell on Jenkin's, "Are you sure? Don't you also want to go?"

"I do" Jenkin's said. "But seeing everyone leaving, and looking at these mountains and this scenery, and all of the other players here, I don't think I will fit in back over there" he said. "I think this is where I belong." Jenkin's nodded, as if confirming to himself what he just said.

I looked at the world, even I was becoming hesitant to leave it, I would never see it again, never be with these people again, everything was going to change again, and I was already missing everything.

Richard put the straps on, "Thank you Jenkin's" he said. "Sorry, I really want to go back, I can't handle being here any longer"

"Don't worry, you'll forget about me soon enough, go and have fun over there, it's just across the sky. Besides, you have more important places to go than I do."
 
Just as Jenkin's was going to light Richard's firework, a noticed something falling from the sky, twittling and twirdling back and forth.

"That's someone's letter" I said. I caught it and opened it, it was from the others, they said they had all gotten there safely, and were waiting for us. Below it was the same government stamp.

"You should go to them" Jenkin's said, "That's where you belong" 

Richard was full of instructions until the end, "Make sure you do this, and this, and don't put this here, it won't work, and when you position it, hold it like this, so the wind won't get to it..." 

Jenkin's nodded and smiled. "Yes, yes"

"You got it?" Richard said

"Yes"

He looked up at Jenkin's "Well then I guess this is farewell, thank you for everything, and sorry to make you stay behind." He turned to me, "I guess I'll see you later then"

Richard rocketed up into the sky immediately. He shouted something, but it was caught in the wind and hard to catch.

"What did he say, I missed it" Jenkin's said.

"Sparkling Dragons" I said.

"Oh" Jenkin's smiled.

Then Jenkin's put the equipment on me. "You're actually doing it" he said, "I didn't think this was possible"

"Going home" I said. I wondered if I would be having dinner with my family tomorrow night, sitting around the dining table as usual. Getting yelled at by my parents. 

"Someone is always going to have to be left behind in this world" Jenkin's said, "It's me for now"

Then I heard a faint sound, unlike anything else.

We hadn't heard a baby crying before, at least that's what it felt like. 

"It's coming from the respawn area" Jenkin's said. "It's where I came from." He paused, then looked at the sky, as if it had become further away. "And I know that sound. It's Elsie"

"Elsie?" Jenkin's said, "His composure disappeared, and a huge grin echoed on his cheeks. "Is that really Elsie? Our Elsie?"

"There's none other Elsie but her" he said. "You need to go get her" It was my role to get her. "She needs you the most"

I walked to the respawn area, looking back, I didn't want to leave Jenkin's alone, he stood and watched, with a grin. But it looked a lot more forced than normal. I waved back cheerfully, I was glad to be so close to Elsie.

Among a sanddune, diagonally placed on the hill was a small gate marking the respawn area. Beyond it was bare sand, and then in the middle was a girl crouched on the ground with her legs bent like wings around her. She had a blue band on her leg.

When I got closer I saw tears that had seeped into the sand, small droplets that quickly evaporated in the intense heat. 

Then she looked up at me, and I saw Elsie's face, the same one I always recognized. "I fell down" she said. "Kei, I fell over and lost everything"

I put my arms around her, "Shh, it's okay" Her head was against my shoulder and the weight of her love was real. She was right here, I hadn't seen her in a long time, people said that she was a screenhopper, vain, sticking to the second strongest player like a barnacle, extremely strong and powerful, helpful to everyone. What I saw now was something different, just a hard lump of desperation. This wasn't Elsie, this was a rock. She was just desperate, like I was. 

"Don't touch me" she said.

"Elsie" I said, "Calm down"

She flung her arm out and pushed me away. "Get away, I don't want to talk to you"

"What's wrong?" I found her in the middle of nowhere, sitting on the ground, "I came here to comfort you, why are you acting like this?" 

"Are you Kei?" she said. 

"Don't you recognize me? I recognized you immediately."

"If you're Kei" she said, "You have to prove it to me"

I could have flared up at her like the fireworks. I could have walked away and not looked back, and I could have calculated something to say that would hurt her. But that wasn't good. I crouched down beside her and told her my story.

"I came here to look for someone in need" I said, "I was looking for another ally, a teammate, and then I found you here."

"Go on" she said.

"I realized that without you, there is nothing in this world, no change."

Elsie looked up, "Go on"

"I am very similar to you" I spoke carefully, any wrong words might stop this from working. "That's why you dislike me"

Elsie smiled, "You're so kind Kei."

Then Elsie started speaking, she told me how she also lost. Just like Lahoe and Guizan and Hamish and everyone else in this world, she also lost. Now some other player who she doesn't even know the name of holds the legendary lime green sword.

"Can I still join the Sparkling Dragons? I know I left and I know I'm a little bit moody and bad at communicating, But..." she said. "Please, I really want to."

"You never left" I said, "I never knew you left"

She smiled. "Do you know why I want to join? It's because I realized that the treasure and power I was hunting for was meaningless. I spent all that time and did all of those politics to become powerful, but after I got the sword, the huge powerful sword, it slipped out of hand and I accidentally dropped it on the ground."

"Suddenly two players dived for it, they saw the opportunity and stole it. I never even considered the possibility, but they immediately became the new owners of the sword, just because I dropped it. Something so small like that. And when I saw the way they were pouncing, it was in pure greed, they didn't see anything around them, they didn't even see each other, it was just the raw power that was right in front of them." She sighed, "I know because I was the same. You don't know it is greed until it becomes obvious. I was looking away for a fraction too long then suddenly lost everything that I laboured for."

She said she became miserable and wailed, like a baby. "First I was disbelieving that I actually lost it, surely it was in some corner of the inventory somewhere. Then they attacked me with the sword, and then I woke up as a level one. That's when I started screaming.

This was the more talkative Elsie I knew who always had something to say.
"You don't mind it?" I said. "Lahoe was miserable and lost himself, Hamish as well. They were very attached to their levels."

She shook her head, "No, I'm fine with it"

"Well, welcome back" I said. 

"I didn't need that sword" she said. "It was ugly anyway." She looked around, her lips were moving more, and she was becoming more energetic.

"Where are Richard and Casey?"

"They've left" I said. "It's only us two now"

"You know, I never told her or you, but Casey and I have brothers who are the same age, Casey and Elsie. That's why we got along so well. Casey doesn't know that though"

"Oh really"

"And Richard" She blushed, then leaned in to me like a diagonal"Do you think he still likes me?"

"He always liked you" I said, "And I think he was disappointed when he had to leave without you"

"But do you think he was looking at me in that way?" she said.

"What way?"

"People are all so disgusting, everyone's thinking only of sex all the time. That's one reason I like this world, there's no sex, and no pregnancies"

"But you were with Hamish and Lahoe" I said.

"They called me a man juggler" she said, "But in this world there's no serious stuff, so we can just all play around and nothing really serious happens"

Elsie turned away from where I was leading her. She pulled me along with her and we walked perpendicular.

"I've always loved the beach" she said, "At home, I grew up near a beach and we went there all the time. I want to go to the beach now"

I didn't know where any beaches were around here, but withint a few steps Elsie stopped and cupped her ear and closed her eyes, as if enjoying a sound, refreshed by it. "Do you hear it?" she cupped my ear with both her hands, they were warm against the tip of my ear. I started to hear waves crashing on a shore, water trickling up and down the shoreline. "It's the beach, right nearby"

She found the beach in the middle of the sand dunes, the water was swishing round and round in a circle, Elsie sat down next to it, the sand was in orange pebbles, sloping down to the waterline.

"I was defeated" she said. She bent her legs to tuck them in under her chin. "It feels weird"

"Is it an uncomfortable feeling?"

"No, it's just...different. I don't feel like retraining anymore."
The huge waves were sweeping in and howling out, growing cold and leaning on us. The grains were soft under us, felt like cushions on my bum.

"So what are you going to do?"

"Kei, I found myself copying you" she said, "I was trying to be myself, and then people around me kept saying that when they saw me, they were reminded of a player they knew, they called him the King."

"Who said that?" I said.

"Just everyone" She stretched out her legs, letting the tips of her shoes touch the damp water then retrieved them back in again, she shivered once or twice in the cold. "You're the king aren't you?"

"I think so" I said. "That's what everyone tells me"

"I didn't have much in the other world, the world we came from, so I played all these games to try and distract myself. I am actually a fat and rude girl."

I nodded

"But my life wasn't the only think that was broken, then I came here to be myself, and I find I am just like you."

"I'm the same" I said, "Everyone tells me about you, no matter what I do. Even when I am with the girl I like, they remind me of you."

"Is that annoying?" she said.

"No, it's just weird"

Elsie turned around and pulled my arms out she made me put the tips of my sheos in the water, then played with them and put my feet back. "People all make up excuses when I'm in a bad mood, they dismiss me saying I'm having 'that time of the month'. But you know what? There are no months in this game, isn't that funny"

"Yeah"

"They're just misogynists who disregard women, even some women are like that. I don't even know what it was about, some small thing that just blew up into this huge annoyance. So I got annoyed and left them to level by themselves, I didn't tell anyone their secret, I just left them." 

"Hmm"

She laughed, "There's not even a moon here, why do people say things like that, whatever they want, it's so frustrating"

"What? How does that relate?"

"Because the moon is months, that's why"

"Oh, right"

She went on, "And you know Warren right? He doesn't even apologize, he's so insensitive. He says all sorts of offhand things, I don't think he even realizes it, but it hurts to listen to him. When he said something like that to Casey I stepped up and said something to him. Then I think he started spreading rumours about me ebcause he was upset about that. In the end I returned and apologized, and they also apologize to me as well."

"Okay"

"I was waiting for ages, but Lahoe never thought about me, it's like I don't exist in his life. So I won't trust his judgment, it will only get them in trouble."

I didn't really understand what she was saying, it was bits and pieces of this and that, like a packet of crunchy chips.

"After I went away and fought, I easily became the strongest solo player, but I didn't trust others anymore, I would fall to them easily if I was approached by them, but I decided to trust you Kei and give up my levels."

"How do you feel now?" I said.

"A bit better" she said. Then she leaned forward and coughed out loud, shaking herself from the depths. It didn't sound very good, but she soon recovered and looked over to me. "I'm fine" she held her hair and wrapped it back around behind her.

"Good" I stood up.

"Sit down" she said, "Enjoy this" She pulled my arm to make me sit. We sat for a bit, her breathing was loud, as if she was thinking of something really powerful. "You and me" she said, "We're meant to be like this here, we can't be very different from each other"

"Okay" I said.

A moment later she breathed out a big one and stood up and stretched her arms and waist, "Fine, let's go" she pulled me up, then stopped mid-step, "Are you upset?" she said.

"No, why"

"Because you have to be with me, you could have done anything else, but you have to stay with me now."

"I don't mind it" 

"Good" she said. But I could tell she still wasn't satisfied, I could tell at the base of myself, it was lying in the dirt and scraped up form the bottom of the bowl with a metal spoon.

"Elsie" I said, "Do you know that I would go and respawn next to you, if that is what you needed. I would do it immediately without any hesitation."
                     
She is still upset, "I'm not upset" she said, "Why are you telling me this?" She coughed a dry sphere of air.

"I will do it without hesitation, without a second glance anywhere else, do you know that?"

She was still upset. Her words didn't say it, but her body language was blatant.

"Without any doubts, no matter what you said, I will leave together with you."

She is still upset.

I picked up my courage and hugged her. Then I felt her tremble in my arms, was it a good tremble or a bad one? I had to look.

She was smiling beneath my arms, the corner of her nose dipping into my muscle and nudging it like a penguin would.

"How does that feel" I said.

"It feels weird" She rubbed her cheek against my arm "Hmm, it's so weird"

"Admit it, you're delighted and comfortable" 

"Not really" She pulled her head away and blinked at me. "What else can you do?"

"What else do you want?" I said

"Where else can you touch me?" I felt her cold fingers wrap around my arm and pull it upwards. I pulled away. 

"I can't" I said.

"Dirty man" her head was slanted sideways and she was moving almost as horizontally as she was vertically. She was aimed at me with her lips, but everywhere else of her was nowhere in particular.  It was almost like Elsie was acting like she was drunk, and laughing about things only she found funny." She coughed out loud, then this time a few diamonds she had in her mouth came out and clanked down on the sand amidst strings of saliva.

She coughed more and a few more diamonds came out. 

She lay back down against the sand, touching it with her fingers, now her feet were dipped into the waves and were getting wet up to her clothing. She gripped the wet sand in her fist, grasped it like it was a carpet keeping her on the ground.

"You don't know" she said, "I had a dream"

"What kind of dream?" I said. 

"Well, I was sitting at home in the sunshine and enjoying it. Then another woman happened to be there. She smiled and told me the sunshine was hers, so I should feel free to leave"

"And did you leave?"

"I don't know, I woke up as level one"

"Okay"

"I had another dream" she said. "Do you want to hear it"

"Go ahead"

"After I collapsed, I had a dream" she said, "But I'm not sure if it was a dream, because it was real. For days I had been chasing a big beast, with a long tail that flicked around behind it, I couldn't see it's head, but always chased the tail, as it glimmered through the sky. Then one day after a long time chasing it I caught up to it and found its home. It's den. I ran up to it and fought it there, then it cried out, really loud, then retreated back through a door on the far side, a normal small yellow door."

"Did you follow it through the door?" I said.

"I saw the beast disappear, and then behind it the long tail glided all around the room getting shorter and shorter until the end of it finally disappeared. It was like the cord on the vacuum machine, when you pull it in, getting sucked back into the machine, until it disappears inside. Then the door shut behind it, as loudly as a small door could."

"Then what happened?"

I waited there for two minutes, and then a beautiful woman came out, she was wrapped in a red and white and pink dress with flowers on, and walking with one foot in front of the other, holding her dress shut. She was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. She was completely oblivious to me and that I had just been in a big fight out here, but when she looked at me, I saw that she had the same gaze that the beast had"

Elsie fell silent, then asked me. "What does it mean Kei?"

"I don't know" I said. "Jenkins or someone will probably attempt to describe it to you, they will say they know what it means, but me, I don't know"

"I don't either" Elsie said... "But it made me wonder, "Is there any point in talking if there is no one listening? Is there any point in listening if the talking is not worth anything? Is there any point in laughing if there is no one to laugh with?"

"One last one" she said, "I heard that people are made of gold, is that true?"

"I don't know" I said, "I don't know much, and I really don't know the answers to those questions"

"Can't you just say yes?" she said, "It will make me happier"

"Yes" 

"You can't say it now! It's too late, now I already know"

"Oh, right"

"You're so weird" she said. "Did anyone tell you that yet?"

"No, you're the first one"

She stood up again. "Okay, let's go" she pulled me up, and walked back towards where the fireworks were. As she walked she talked, in tempo with her progress





"I have told you so many things, Kei, do you know what that makes me?"
"A woman?" I said.

"No, but yes, but no, that makes me like your memory. You have been picking up all of the trash and pearls on the ground, we all walk past it, but you go and pick it up. It is just lying around there, so you are helpful and go and pick it all up. But you know what, who picks you up?" 

"I don't know" I said.

"I don't know either" she said.

We approached the area Jenkin's was at. He was sitting still and twiddling his thumbs. He looked up at us when we arrived, "You're finally here" he said, "I was wondering when you would get here"


We walked back, Jenkin's was sitting quietly and fiddling with the equipment.

"Where is everyone?" she said, "Wasn't there supposed to be a gathering here?"

"They've gone" I looked into the sky. Then at the ground where they had been standing a moment before, all of the cheerful laughs, all the jokes, they had all stopped. Now it was just us three here.

"So Jenkin's is left with the worst job of taking care of everyone?" Elsie laughed, then Jenkin's also laughed, 



"What's happening?" Elsie said. "Why is Old Man Jenkin's here?"

"He's helping us leave" I said. 

"Aren't you coming as well? You've been waiting for us"

"No" Jenkin's said, "I'm not welcome in that world" he pointed to his head, "Up here's not welcome" He took out the equipment and put it on. I put it on as I had earlier, but Elsie stood still and held it in her hands. Letting it slip off and hang down like it was slivers of water falling down her hands and fingers.

"I don't want to go back" she said.

"Come on Elsie" Jenkin's said. "It's time to go now"

Elsie shook her head, "No, I can't"

I helped Jenkin's put the equipment on her, wrapping the belts around her waist and putting the helmet on.

Then Elsie really started writhing. "I dont' want to leave, I don't want to leave" She was throwing a tantrum in the middle of the desert, there was nothing around us, only sand dunes for as far as could be seen.

"Everyone else has left" Jenkin's said, "Don't you want to go with them? You're going to be here alone"

She was screaming now, and writhing in contest. "I don't want to go, no matter what you tell me, I'm not going to listen, I don't want to go"

"Just now you wanted to leave" I said.

I held Elsie down as Jenkins wwrapped the rest of the equipment around her, then he tied the firework to her. She was crying and yelling, kicking her legs trying to get us away.

I knew I would never see this world again. My thoughts wandered back to everything that I could remember. All of the people around me and how they had changed. Elsie had adjusted to life in this world so much that anything else seemed to be worthless. I felt myself gravitating towards the other world as if by force of habit. but how about Elsie? Was she the same? The name of a home was incredibly powerful. Once Elsie goes, Jenkin's would be left alone. Then both of their stories would end. 

Jenkin's looked back at me with stubble on his chin and wrinkled fingers, "Are you ready?" he said, "I'll send you off when you say so"

Suddenly Jenkin's felt really powerless and old. So old that he would be forgotten. I tried to hold back tears that were forming from muscles being jerked around.

Lahoe muttered something before crawling back to the real world. It wasn't a passion that took Elsie through this world, but a fear to the extent of a phobia, that made every inch of her tremble like an earthquake. And it wasn't something unique to here, wherever she went, she would always have that phobia close behind her in tow.

Elsie nodded. "I don't want to go" She looked at me for guidance, for help. 

Casey and Richard had also developed so much. They had nurtured their talents for these immense accomplishments. It never would have happened in the other world. Everyone was doing so well.

And me, at the end of everything, I had become a stronger person. I was less afraid of things, and I cared more for others. 

Elsie nodded, she was similar, I knew, but she also just nodded to everything now. Now she was waiting for a final direction to go in. This last step was giving her a lot of difficulty. But even so, she knew that a sense of direction was more important.

Elsie had been following me up till now, but this final step was giving her a lot of difficulty. "This is it" I said, "If you do this, it will be fine"

Then I strapped my firework on, and Jenkin's stood behind me to light it.

Then Elsie reached out to me, "Kei, don't go!" she said, "Don't leave me behind, I don't want to be left alone." She had tears streamign down her eyes and snot on her top lip. She gripped me with all her strength, then looked up at the sky, "No, I can't, I have nothing over there" 

I wasn't sure anymore if we should be taking Elsie, just based on a habit. But I looked at Jenkin's he nodded, it had to be done.

Jenkin's lit the firework on me, I had a few seconds on the ground. I looked around and smiled. Elsie was holding onto me. "Thank you Jenkin's, you've been such a great friend" He looked back at me and smiled, but it wasn't a happy smile, it was the saddest smile I had ever seen on any face and it made me feel guilty to be leaving while he was staying behind.

"I will miss you" he said.

"Jenkin's is going to steal your firework!" Elsie, who had been watching Jenkin's suddenly shouted out "Hurry up and go before he takes yours"

Jenkin's frowned, "He won't do that" I said, then I looked at him "He's too good a friend for that"

"And you're too bad a friend" he said, there was a dry rasp, and I knew that he had lit the firework.

"Don't leave Kei" Elsie cried and tried to hodl my arm but Jenkins held her back. She was crying again, and desperately trying to hold onto me. I knew I wasn't supposed to, but I reached out and placed my arm on her cheek to comfort her. As soon as there was contact, she stopped crying and stared back at me.

"I had a really good time" I said, "But now it's time to move on. "You were all..." I shot up mid sentence, suddenly Jenkin's and Elsie were far below me, and the sand had dissipated into a screen of wavy brown. I soared up higher and higher, accompanied only by the sound of the firework burning. 

The world grew smaller and smaller around me, all of the mountains stretched into the distance, up higher was the rich blue sky, and underneath were more and more players.

I wonder if they saw me leave. They might think, Kei the King is leaving now, he has become able to fly and is flying out of this world. The legendary king who found wings in everyone.

"...the best friend's I ever had..." I finished my sentence for myself as I soared higher and higher up, further and further away from this world.

In the end, I was able to separate myself from all the other players, I was going to get out of the world and be free while others are still duelling and leveling up. Right now at this moment, soaring through the sky, with nothing around me, I felt incredibly free. Maybe some of them will look up to see him flying out, and they might think that it is a shooting star, before realizing that there are no stars in this sky, only clouds.  So much was done here, but now I was leaving it all behind.

Or they might not think at all.

I heard a faint scream. I wasn't sure if it was jsut the fireworks, or if it was Elsie far down below, I couldn't even see them anymore, only the horizon, even the lake that I had been at with Casey.

Then I also felt a panic hit me. This was the last I would see of this world, I was leaving everything behind. And even though I had wanted to leave so badly, I had wanted to go back home. I was going to miss everything, no one should ever experience what we did, yet it was also the most amazing life to be had.

Jenkin's was left behind. But he would probably leave this world one day, and so would the other players, following our example. And one day everyone would also leave, like we were. Maybe they would find their other ways, but they would, because if people really wanted to do something, not the players, then they would find a way for it to happen.

But not everyone would leave, there was one person who would stay behind. She was the first player to enter this world, and might be the only one left.

I wondered if Aloola was watching us now as we flew out. I wonder what she thought to see us leaving this world. She was standing somewhere and looking into the sky perhaps, silently, without a word.

One day though, this world would become quiet, with only her here. I wonder if she always expected it and was dreading it. Or maybe she had never thought that far. 

Who would ever know the intentions of the artist.

I stopped looking below, at everything that I had known and turned my head to look up, against the wind blowing against my hair, and nose, making it drool in the cold. The sky just kept going up all around. I was deep in this light blue, and there was no change, the blue was replaced by more blue, and more. This was where we entered. 

This was where it all started. Back then I didn't know anyone.

The other world was close, I felt like I could hear it, just pushing on the border of this one. Any second now.

Then, words started to appear all around me. White floaitng words, like think streaks of clouds. All around me. It was the credits.

There were a lot of names I didn't know, I found Jake and Fermol, even Una. I could imagine them pointing to themselves in pride upon seeing it. But there was no Old Man Jenkin's. I couldn't find anything relating to him. Without it, there was no proof of him ever existing.

But it did appear,

"Old Man Jenkin's" - Associate Director;

I laughed, he still called himself Old Man in the credits.

But there was a name missing, the director. Aloola's name was nowhere, the director was left blank.

I knew why she would do that, because she really existed, it was because she must not have believed that anyone would ever see these words. These credits were never supposed to be seen, no one was ever supposed to leave.

The credits finally ended. My toes were itching, I wanted to be walking again. I looked down one last time, now the ground was covered in clouds. And I wondered if Jenkin's was looking up to this sky that I was now a part of.

Then the firework fizzled and popped. 

Words blew up around me. I read it and smiled, it was Casey's message, about how we met, it was her answer to my confession. I could see why she was too shy to say it to my face. But she put it in the wrong firework and I was reading it now. 

I had to see Casey again.


The wooden house with staircases had three people in it. "What's the biggest difference between those two?" An old man asked his friend. They were watching two others, one girl was asleep in the couch. She was healing from all sorts of wounds.

"The boy and the girl?"

"Yes"

"It's that the girl has stopped playing the game" 

The old man nods, "Maybe, maybe so"

"It is" the other old man says, "She's really good at it though"

"Yes, she's used to it, but she's been bored for a very long time already"

A little far away, a girl watched shooting stars fly into the sky and explode into flowers of dust. 

She walked slow at first, but faster and faster until she was half running. She found a man at the bottom of the stars. Dust was falling around him still. She told him that she stayed behind to remain with him, otherwise he would be alone, it's too unfair for him. She is unable to leave him, because he is so generous. She tells him that she didn't want to risk losing her levels, she doesn't want to do that, he skills were carefully tailored, designer skill set.

She knows she said she would, and it is unexpected that she would be unwilling, but whent the time comes, she cares too much for what she has. The man doesn't say she's vain, he says nothing. 

She wants to become the king and queen of this world with her lover. But her lover would rather be with someone else.

So she stayed to keep him company.

### Chapter "Final" Fifty

Alright...I mean.,,.ALRIGHT!!! Thanks for stikcing this far, the story just seemed to stretch on and on, but we're at the last chapter!!! Sorry if it kept getitng longer and longer like an exponential equation. But this is where everything ends... or doesn't end...(spoiler alert...)
Anyway, thanks a lot guys, it means soooooo much to have you come this far!!!!!XOXO

My eyes opened to hear music. Real recorded music, I smiled. "O baby..." A young MJ.

"Do you like Michael Jackson?" It was a voice I didn't recognize, a new voice with new intonations. I looked to my side to see a beautiful woman wearing white. She looked like an angel.

Except Angel's don't sneeze do they? 

Her name badge said it all. She wasn't an angel, she was a nurse called Danielle, and from the looks of it, she was just starting out at the job. She was clumsy with the things around her.

"Sorry" she wiped her nose with a tissue and threw it in the bin beside my head. "You've finally woken up, your parents were getting really worried" Then she smiled and wiped her nose again.

"I'm Danielle" she said, "Welcome back to the real world" I looked out the window to see trees and metal skyscrapers stretching up, cars were honking, and people were walking everywhere.

"This is the real world you know" she said. "People greet each other here"

She was staring at me as if I was a piece of dust. Like I didn't belong in this world, some scum that didn't deserve to be here. I felt weird.

"I'm sorry Danielle" I said, "It's just been such a long time"

She looked at her watch, I could tell that she was here by way of obligation. "I have a date tonight" she said, "So I'm going to be heading off now, I'll tell your parents that you're awake."

Danielle was welcoming us back, to the real world. Where I wanted to come for so long. Here there was dust in the air, not pixellated digital dust, but the dust of other peoples' skin and rubbish. Dust of existence.

I looked over my bed, it had a number written down. A reference number, there were thousands of patients here, they had to keep track of us with numbers. Then there were documents lying next to me. They were turning yellow, I couldn't imagine how long they had been left there.

I pressed the button to call a nurse. But Danielle didn't appear, moment later another woman appeared. She held out her hand with a big smile, there was a ring on her finger. her lips were varnished with a dark red, the same red as the level bar.

"Hi, I'm Jane Myermore" she said, "A representative from Brick gaming" She took my hand and shook it. "How was your experience? I will have you know that Brick gaming is very happy to have you back, and is optimistic on your journey to a full recovery." 

Full recovery? What was she talking about. There was nothing wrong with me.

"You're right" she smiled, "My mistake, there's nothing wrong with you" She brought out a few papers from her red bag and placed them on the table. 

"When you feel ready, before you leave, please fill these forms out and deliver them to me" she said.

She looked over for a response, but unable to get one, she turned around to leave, closing the door quietly behind her. I could hear her heels echo down the hallway and open another door.

I didn't see the other players after that. They weren't in the same place, we had all been taken to separate locations to split the cost of caring us equally between hospitals. No one hospital wanted to take care of all of us.

My parents started crying when they saw me. My mother later told me that she never thought she would see me smile again. My older brother gave me a warm hug telling me that it was good to have me back, and he would bully me as much as he could to make up for the time I was away.

Then a small face came into view, a little girl stood in front of me with her hands on mine. She looked at me carefully and curiously, and considerately.

"This is your Layla" Mom smiled and put her hands on the the girl's shoulder. "She's your younger sister."

The little girl looked up at me like I was a complete stranger, but someone she had to respect. 

And I was, who was I to walk into her life like this? To her I wasn't a brother, I was someone who occupied the thoughts of those around her.

"Hold your brother's hand" Mom said, "He will need your support"

She put her hands on mine, then looked up at Mom, "Like this Mummy?"

Mom looked at me to see how I felt, then nodded.

That night, for the first time in a long time, we sat at the dinner table as a whole family. Mom made huge meals and didn't stop smiling. She offered me more and more food, even my brother stayed over. 

"So what did you do all that time?" My older brother asked, "Did you just waste your time away asleep? Or did you do anything fun?"

I told him about the leveling system, and how I had found a team of great friends. My brother sniggered, "They were stuck in it too?"

"Yeah" I said, "There were a lot of us stuck there, it's a miracle that we got out"

When Mom brought the food, I noticed that her walking had become slower, and there were more wrinkles on her face. My father acted the same, but he ate a bit less and looked outside more. My older brother had been in university before I left, now he had been working in a dead end job in a supermarket swiping barcodes for six years.

Seven years I had been away, and in all that time my family hadn't forgotten about me. My room was still left the same, and my mother hadn't allowed a tinge of dust to collect. She vacuumed it everyday, just like I was living there.

"We believed you would come back" Dad said, "We had to"

I told them about my friends, "I met a guy called Richard who became an excellent engineer, and this girl Casey is an amazing chef"

My brother interrupted with a grin, "Is she hot? This Casey chick."

"I don't know" I said, "I haven't seen her in real life"

"I'll bet she's not" he said, "Gamer chicks aren't hot"

I carried on "There's a girl called Elsie, her combat is unmatched the best in the game"

"She's hot isn't she?" My brother said, "She has to be."

"Stop it Jake" Dad said, "Let Kei carry on" He leaned in, interested in everything he was hearing. Occasionally he asked questions about how the mechanics of the game worked.

"There were also two Warren and Israel were the initial programmers who helped design the game" 

"They designed it? This whole thing?"

"Yeah" I said, "Amazing right?"

"Well then I want to tell them to never work again, they take my son away from me for seven years!! What kind of work do they think they're doing."

I couldn't tell him that they were highly respected in the game. 

"And there was a guy called Lahoe" I said.

"I know him" my brother said, "He was the same year as me in Uni and got stuck in that game too. He was a high achiever, going to University at 14, he had a lot going for him" He grinned, "But you know what? I hear he's unemployed and can't find a job. No one wants t hire someone as anti-social as he is anymore."

I wondered how Lahoe was doing, I hadn't realized that he was living so close to me. 

One Sunday I sat in bed looking out the window, I felt like I wasn't worth much anymore, everyone was treating me like an expensive antique that has been placed in a two dollar shop. If they say something, I might crack, and that would be devastating. Here no one knew who I was or what I had done. In school I was another reference number, a test score. At home I was a son with the obligation to find a job. 

When I saw Mum in the world, she was crying in relief, but I didn't know. I felt like I didn't know her well. 

I looked up and saw an older mother than I knew. She walked a bit slower, and was a bit more clumsy with everything. And I knew why I felt weird. Because I felt shy around my own mother. 

And that smell, the moment I opened my eyes in this world I could smell the effluvium reeking. I was something new in this world, death. Mum looked at me with relief and love. But slowly, everyone here had been getting closer and closer to death. And when others looked at me, they were curious, like looking at a stranger. I had been away and still for so long that I had become an antique picture, trapped in time. I didn't feel like a person, just a shadow that was stared at.

But now we were all just unemployed losers in this world. Lahoe hadn't found a job, and I couldn't either. Who would want to hire us, who hadn't been on the earth for the past seven years. We were literally aliens.

After the initial adjusting wore off, my mother told me that she was very upset that I had so irresponsibly gone into a game. No one asked me of what it was like in there, they just laughed.

I was just another student in the world. I was seven years behind where I was supposed to be. I was told I was already 25, half of my youth had disappeared.

When I put on new school clothes, making sure they looked good enough not be laughed at by my classmates, I told myself that, "Just another student." Nodded, and went out the door. 

A lot of my classmates knew that my long absence had been due to my absorption in a game. They gave me weird glances. I chose to ignore them, just like I chose to ignore the laughter directed at me, and the annoyance from my parents.

When I got home from a long day, we had another big family dinner, everyone was overjoyed. I told everyone that I used to be a king and everyone looked up to me.

"Hmm" Mom said, "Interesting" Then she went on to tell me about a job place that opened up and is looking to hire, because I am young and talented, they will probably hire me.

"I'm not young anymore" I said. 

"Don't kid yourself, compared to me, you're young" She didn't smile though.

"I lost seven years of my life!" I said, "Do you realize that?"

That night Mom was crying in her room, all of the delicious food and tastes couldn't make up for the time that I had lost here, time by her side.

Dad handed me the phone. "Listen to the answering message" he said. "It's from your girlfriend" He held out the receiver, "Well, I guess she's more like an ex now."

"My girlfriend?" Dad sighed, I listened, there was a beep, then a girl's voice. She sounded about twenty and was using slang that I had almost forgotten.

"Hey Kei, your Mom and Dad say you've gone into some new technology game or something, and it's already 5pm, you're not here in front of the statue at the park , so I'm guessing you forgot about our date or something, no worries, it doesn't really matter, just call me when you get this message." 

she hung around the receiver for a bit, I could hear her breathing before she hung up.

There was another message behind it. Also from Melissa, dated a day earlier. It was the sound of the PIN of the numberpad being used to make a tune, I quickly recognized it as happy birthday. Thens he started singing 

Sorry this is a bit cheesy Kei, I mean it's really cheesy okay? But you said you didn't have anyone sing you happy birthday

Then she started singing, in an out of tune voice, she was badly off key but she didn't mind it, she kept singing. The feeling was there.

I'm sorry about that argument the other day over something small, when you left I felt down and upset, but I sang you happy birthday on the phone through the answering machine, and it's really embarrassing, so don't tell anyone about it okay?

She laughed on the other end before hanging up. I was listening to this message seven years later, and it was so touching. It had been sitting there the whole time until I listened to it. Wasting away.

I looked at the name on the phone, it said "Melissa"

Who was Melissa?

Then the memories started to come back to me, before I left, I had gotten a date with Melissa, a girl I had crushed on for ages, I had come home telling Mom all about it, and had laid awake at night thinking of her. 

But in the end, I hadn't make it.

My heart started beating and I punched in numbers. The phone dialed, then a woman answered. "Hello?" It was quiet around her, she was alone somewhere.

"Is this...Melissa?" I couldn't complete the sentence, the memories were still flowing back into me as I tried to talk.

"Kei?" she said. "From Uni?"

I didn't know what to say, only to answer her dumbly. "Yes"

"What's up?" she said. "How come you're calling?"

"Hey...I just got your message, and was wondering how you were doing" I heard some yelling in the background, and the receiver on her end moved. 

"I'm good" I heard her move the phone and walk to somewhere more quiet. "Why are you calling after all there years"

"I wanted to apologize for missing that date" I said. "And if you're still free maybe we can..."

"You realize it's been seven years Kei?" she said. "I'm married with kids"

"You're married?" Those kids were hers? Not her aunts.

"I'm twenty seven" she said, "Of course I'm married" She fell silent, I didn't know what to say, this was completely unexpected.

"Why didn't you call me earlier Kei? You never responded so I thought you gapped it, it really hurt me you know, standing there and waiting."

"I couldn't go" I said "I was trapped in a game" I had to tell her how I really felt, it was all coming back to me "I still like you Melissa"

She laughed, hard. A minute later she was still laughing. 

"Are you serious?" she said, "Are you totally serious or just having me on?"

Everyone laughed when they heard that I liked them. Even I wanted to laugh, if it wasn't so serious to me I would be lying on the floor laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. 

"You could have at least called or given me a message or something. What kind of person ignores someone they like for seven years? How insensitive are you, it's below a human. After seven years you're calling me, expecting to carry on like there was nothing in between? Like all of that time never happened? Get over yourself, things have changed so move on, I hate guys like you who think they can do anything they want." She paused and when her voice returned it was without a trace of emotion. "And don't call me again, I won't answer anymore."

She hung up and I listened to the beep of the phone for a long long time.

My sister Layla asked for bedtime stories every night. My life at home was completely different. At first I read her bedtime stories every night, but once I told her something that happened in the game world, and she really enjoyed it. She laughed before falling asleep.

So I told her another one, and another, until every night I was reliving my memories in the game. And Layla came to me asking for a new story every night. When I started telling it, it came easily, slipping through my mouth.

I told her about Richard, how he really liked one of our friends, but she wanted to do something else. Then I told her about the sword that everyone wanted.

"Did you get it Kei?" she said.

"I didn't, I wasn't strong enough" I said.

"Can I play that game too?" she said. "It sounds so much fun"

"You can't" I patted her head, "Because when you go there you can't come back"

Layla looked at me, "Mummy thought you would never come back, she always cried whenever anyone said your name. But I didn't know who you were"

"Do you like me now?" I said.

She nodded, "Yes, because you tell me bedtime stories every night"

Over the next nights I told her about everything I could remember and stopped when she fell asleep. I found it therapeutic for myself as well. These memories were the fuel that kept my fire burning.

I told her of when Lahoe fell and crumbled, I walked off, but then Lahoe decided to follow me for some reason. I told her what I thought of it, that tt all doesn't matter anymore, people make mistakes, and you just live with them. 

I looked over at Layla to see if she was listening, or if it was going over her head, it was complicated things to be telling a young girl. 

But she was lying there with her arms behind her head and looking at the roof, then at me. "And then?" she said, "Then what?"

She was devouring my stories so fast, I couldn't believe how much she enjoyed them.

I told her about all sorts of things, random details, "We gained diamonds through negative effects of the system. But if a player had no diamonds, by defeating them you would get 1 diamond. This meant there was less incentive" I looked at Layla, "Uhh, less of a reason...to attack them. That is the rule of this world, more direct, and also more cruel."

I told her about Casey upon seeing Jenkin's "Who are you? How do you know so much?" Casey said when she finally met him at the end. Upon seeing Jenkins before the leaving party Just like at a train station, saying bye to friends, who you know you might never see again. 

I told her how Jenkin's was probably still doing something in that world, living his life, and I would never see him again. 
 
I told her about combat, "I watched Elsie, analyzed her play style, saw how there were certain things she did that showed her character and why she chose that style. If there was a course, he could lecture about it" Then I looked over to Layla and knew that maybe she would be my only student.

Layla was puzzled, "So, diamonds or fighting style, which one is more important?"

"I don't know" I said.

She propped herself up from my lap, "Then can you tell me of all the things in the world, what was the most important thing in the whole world?" She spread her arms out wide then put them back under the covers.

"That's something a good friend of mine would always say" I said, "And I don't know what the answer is"

I told her how there was a crazy strong enemy. Then Elsie who was absent goes and beats that enemy easily, everyone was talking about it and she was famous.

I told her how Casey was the princess of cooking, Elsie was unbeatable at combat. and that Richard was a chief engineer, he ditched fighting, because he is good at it and hears that they need one.

"Will I ever get to try her cooking?" Layla said.

"Maybe if you're a good girl" I said, "Then she might come"

At the dinner table we had a huge meal. Layla started telling Mum about my stories, she said they were the most fun part of her day. She said her favourite story was when a girl called Casey had chocolate but only gave it to her friends she really liked, and some of the other people were weird so she didn't give them any, she said how Kei hoped he would get the chocolate, but she gave it to Kei's friend instead, and not sharing it with him. But in the end the two of them, Kei and Casey were still happily ever after.

I found myself blushing, she had remembered every detail of the story. But instead of laughter, the table fell silent.

"Layla, can you go and check if the cat has been fed?" Mum said. Dad crunched his knuckles on the table.

"Ok, is he hungry?" Layla jumped up from the stool and bounded off to the backdoor.

Mum and Dad were staring at me.

"Layla loves your stories" Mum said.

"Isn't it great?" I felt that it was really connecting us.

Then Mum put some of the food in her mouth, I didn't know what, I was too intent on the words.

"After you....left" she said, "We were so sad, your father and I, I thought I lost my baby who I took care of for twenty years."

"It was eighteen" I said.

"That's why, we had another child" she said, "We thought we would never see you again" Dad nodded. 

"I'm back, I'm still the same aren't I?" The way they said it, made me feel like I was replaced and wasn't welcome anymore.

"Layla is a young girl" Mum said, "I don't want you to tell her things like that, she's too young for it"

"It's my life that I'm telling her about" I said, "It's nothing bad like you think"

"Your life" Dad said, "Don't tell her about what happened there, shes too young for it. Can't you find something better to talk about? Like how your University life is going? The sports you play? Or can't you just tell her stuff that normal children would learn? The things you're telling her are unsuitable, it's about fighting and arguing, is that what you want your little sister to learn."

"In that world" I said, "There were kids too, there were wars, but we survived through all of it, it wasn't violent or looked down on."

Dad shook his head, "Just don't, please, tell her normal stories that normal girls would want to know, you're here now, not there, get over it."

I looked at the both of them, I didn't feel welcome at all. I felt like I had changed too much to be here. The time lost was proving to be irreplaceable.

I looked down at the table, and wound some cold spaghetti around the fork, only the handle was warm from my grip of it. "Do you know anything about my life there? Have you heard what we did?"

"I don't care" Dad said. "Just don't tell Layla about it anymore, it's a bad influence on here development. If you don't want to read her bedtime stories then you don't have to."

Mum looked at me with pleading eyes, "Please, I don't want to lose my youngest child as well"

"No...I was actually looking forward to telling her my stories every night, but everyone else didn't care, they found it a nuisance. They didn't care what happened in that world.

Guizan contacted me, I didn't realize it was him until he gave me his game name. Apparently he was working a small job somewhere and was living in a cramped up apartment. We decided to meet, Guzian was much the same, he just looked a lot more tired here. In the other world he was authoritative, here he was just a small quiet man. He told me that he told his friends about a girlfriend he had, but she was somewhere else and he really missed her, but could never meet her again.

He meant Una, but he didn't tell the others the truth because he would just be seen as a hardcore geek. He had a digital girlfriend.

When we had dinner, Mum asked me about the game world. she may have felt guilty over what happened, but I could tell she was trying to listen, to reconnect to her son.

I told them about Guizan's ring, and how him and Una were together. And then about the respawn area, how there was an extreme hierarchy

"Good riddance you were able to leave, sounds like the worst place" Mum said. "I can't believe I let my son live there for seven years!"

I decided to tell her something a bit more lighthearted. To show her that I hadn't been wasting my time, and had actually been living. "Right before I left, I received a message from a girl called Casey. It basically said that she really likes me, and said all sorts of things that she couldn't say straight to my face." I could picture Elsie reading that letter and laughing hard. 

My older brother grinned, "Wow, you got her man"

Mum asked me where this girl Casey was now, I told her that Casey was somewhere living her life as well.

"Will she come and visit?" Mum said. "I can make dinner for her. Is she pretty?" 

"The Casey I knew was so pretty" I said. 

Mum smiled, I could tell she was happy to have me going out with a girl who was pretty. "Bring her over for dinner okay? I want to see her as well"

"I don't know" I blushed a bit. I pretended to grip a sword and swung it in front of me the way I would have done hundreds of thousands of times as I was leveling. Then when I walked to put my plates away I kicked the air like I always would..

"What are you doing?" My older brother said.

"Nothing"

I showed my brother a picture of Casey that I found on her Facebook. 

He put his fingers on his chin and studied it the way a man studies a vase.
"She's okay..." he said, "From what you were saying, I thought she would be prettier" He put his arms on my shoulders and kneaded them, "Surely my brother can do better than that, she's not that much to look at. Is it her personality that saves her? Or is it her body?"

"She's quiet to those who don't know her" I said, "But she's really nice"

"Niceness is overrated" he said, "You need a girl who's hot, that's what you need."

Casey contacted me a week later, apparently she had also been thinking of me. I had trouble putting the receiver back down. Mum heard about it and said I should ask her to dinner, I guess she was really curious about who she was, if she was a real person who had gone to the strange game world. People were what made up reality. I was going to meet at Casey at one of the parks in between the both of us.

I couldn't believe how excited I was.

Casey looked the same, except that her clothing was cuter and pinker. Her hair was done up, and it looked like she had spent quite a bit of time on her make-up. 

She grabbed my hand and led me to one of her favourite cafe's. we sat for a while and talked. She told me briefly about her life here, and her parents, and about her siblings. It was similar to mine, she said she also felt a disconnect and that's why she really wanted to see me.

"Guizan's not doing too good" she frowned, "And Lahoe's unemployed, I dont what Elsie and Richard are doing, they must be in some other part of the world."

She checked her phone every few minutes for something. Then looked up and carried on the conversation afresh.

"How about you?" she said, "How's your life?"

I couldn't tell her that it was stale, that my greatest joy was reliving memories of the game world, the game world that I had exerted all of my efforts to leave.

"It's like a big pendulum" she said, "You never stop in the middle, you always go past it, from one world to the other all the time, just keep swinging, when you're on one side, the momentum pushes you to the other. It's a constant displacement."

"That's an interesting analogy" I said.

"I know" she said, "I'm smart in this world"

Our conversation started to tip towards the game world, it was what we had most in common.

"Did you know that Lahoe was storing diamonds?" she said

"Really?"

"Yeah, he was storing them so that other players couldn't level up at all"

"That's so selfish of him" I said, "But I guess...I might do the same"

We both laughed. It felt good, here was someone I could talk to properly about the things I knew and cared about.

"New players were at a huge disadvantage, and will just lose diamonds because they don't know what's happening"

"Yeah" Casey laughed and looked out the window with a sip of her coffee "There's nothing like that in this world"

"Not really" I said.

I told Casey about Guizan's ring, 

She had a strong opinion, "Ugh, that's so weak, doesn't he care about it at all?" I was just glad to have connected to her. To have a connection with anyone felt invaluable now.

"Kei" Casey said, "You're so normal, I feel like I'm adjusting to this world better when I talk to you. I'm happy that we're able to talk like this"

"Me too" I said. "But you know, I feel like I haven't done anything good for anyone, at least I can't anymore"

Casey suddenly looked sad. "I knew skills don't follow us here, but still...I feel like I've wasted a lot of my life, I tried cooking when I got back, but I was no good at it. Dad ate everything I made, but that was just to be polite." She looked up, "But never mind, that's just a small thing isn't it."

I knew what she wanted, and it was a scary thought. But I knew because I couldn't say that I hadn't considered it. 

She was thinking about going back.

"I'm adjusting to this life slowly" she said, "Mum sent me to a therapist because I was getting a bit depressed, just a bit, but Mum's always overworried you know."

"Mums' do that." I said.

She touched her cheek with the tips of her fingers in frugality, to check that something was there, and to make sure not to ruin it.

"I'm really a small person." she said. "My life is going back to the way it used to be" she said, "Before everything happened. But it's different, I'm older now, I've gone past my best years, a woman's best years and I'm not as beautiful as I used to be."

"Don't say that" I said.

Casey looked at me, like she was pleading, begging for me to defy her. But I couldn't make myself do that.

"When I leave home to go to school, sitting with all the younger students, I feel old, and everyone is looking at me, so I find myself putting on make-up, everyone's judging me more here."

"People judge because they don't have a purpose" I said. "So they look to see if anyone else around them has a purpose they can latch on to"

"No" she said, "Not really, it's just because they don't like what they see"

"Casey, you're beautiful" I said, but when I said that she winced, like she had heard it a thousand times before from different mouths. "You're a beautiful girl who deserves to be loved by everyone."

"Thanks" she said, "But it's too late, I was told that since I was young, so it doesn't really work anymore. Practice makes perfect." She grinned at her own joke.

The longer I was with Casey the weaker she seemed to become. The holes in her were just growing. I felt like a really bad person for seeing that, but the holes kept growing. I had come here to latch onto her, but instead, she was latching onto me. If we continued like this, we would just sink down into the depths together.

"Anyway, enough of this" she said, "Do you want to come over for dinner? My Mum is excited to meet you"

Casey's house was like mine, a suburban house with a fresh coating of paint on the outside.

Casey knocked on the door and her Mum opened it with a big smile on her face, "You must be Kei" she looked me up and down, "Casey's found herself a handsome young man!"

"Mum stop!" Casey covered her Mother's mouth in embarrassment and looked back at me. I grinned, it reminded me of my home.

"Casey was waiting for you, she was been so excited when you answered, the whole house was a mess."

Casey whined, "Mum, stop, that's private!" 

"Okay, okay" she said.

We had dinner, with Casey's Mum confirming things all the gossip she had heard from the game world. "Is it true?" she said, "And is that true?" 

I nodded, she knew quite a bit.

"Well I'm so glad you were there" she said, "Casey was always talking about you Kei, to think that she might not be back here without you, she might still be away" She leaned over and squeezed Casey's cheeks. "My baby's soooo cuuuute"

Later on, Casey's Mum had to go out to work, she was a nurse and had all sorts of working hours. 
Casey went up to her room. 

I went up later and opened the bathroom door to see her doing more make-up. She wasn't ready for me or the world. 

She became quiet and nervous and dropped her equipment. She took my hand and led me to her room. She didn't turn the light, but walked to the end and turned to face me.

The room was shrouded in darkness. I couldn't describe what expression Casey was wearing, deep and thoughtful. She walked slowly towards me. 

"Did you get my answer?" she said. "To your confession"

"Yes" I said.

She breathed deeply and moved her hair out of her eyes.
"And what did you think?" She touched my arm. "Do you like me?"

"I do" I said. "I really do"

She frowned, "You don't have to sound so forced you know"

"But it's important to say" I said.

"It's not the most important thing" she said. 

Everyone kept saying that, and others as well.

She stepped closer, until I could feel warm breath from her nose on my chin. She looked up at me, we stared at each other. Her eyes moved over my hair, over my lips and chin, into my eyes then out.

I noticed the small dimples in her cheeks, the small start of wrinkles under her eyes, a few eyelashes growing the wrong way, then bits of soft light hair growing on her jaw. 

I wanted to hit myself for thinking that Casey was prettier in the other world. What kind of friend was I to think such a thing, especially when she was so vulnerable about it.

As if changing her mind, Casey stood back and brought out a small cake. 

"In those seven years" she said, "We never celebrated our birthdays, so I thought we could now."

We lit the candles and sang our birthday songs, once, twice, then kept repeating it seven times.

"Now you're older" Casey said. "How does it feel?"

After eating a bit of the cake, we ended up staring at each other again, there was not much else to do, talking about the real world seemed to head towards dead ends. We sat next to each other on her bed. The birthday ceremony felt cheesy, that we were still caught up in the game world when we were here. 

Casey leaned in, she closed her eyes, expectant

When we left with the fireworks, we left everything behind, there was no turning back, and change had happened.

I leaned in, going to kiss Casey, but then pulled back, and breathed deeply. Casey opened her eyes, watching me, then she slowly closed them again and leaned back on the bed.

I closed the door behind me and looked at the wall in front of me, I was breathing heavily.

There were so many ways of insulting someone, but there are only a few ways of commending someone. That was how things worked.

Casey had changed back in the real world, I couldn't talk to her, we were bored when we meet up to do things that couples are supposed to do. Although we had been planning it the whole time, now when we actualluy try to do it, we are bored. Even when we tried to talk about what happened in the other world it didn't seem as exciting or flow as easily.

I stood there with my hands against the wall, outside Casey's room, breathing out fragments of places that I had been, I was outside Casey's room while she was still inside. I bit my lip, gripped my eyes shut, not letting anything out.

I missed it so much, desperately wishing I could go back. I pictured the sword in my hand, Elsie's weeping in my earlobes, Casey's laughter and excitement, Guizan's immense wisdom and his cheeky smile. The bloodcurdling screams of the low level players fighting to become the strongest. The warm glow of the screen in front of me telling me that I was low on health.

Now that I was here, I knew that I didn't belong.

I just wanted to disappear. Maybe I would respawn somewhere else. Somewhere where I would finally be satisfied.

### Afterword:

Thank you Thank you Thank you guys for reading this far, it was crazy long and crazy touching to write, I just hope that it went through!

I used a lot of Cafe's most of it was written in various locations throughout Queenstown.

At first I started it while I was guiding on the Milford Track in New Zealand, knowing that I had to do something. If it was inspired by something, it would probably be Norwegian Wood, by the amazing author __Haruki Murakami!!!!__

I was finding hours in between things to write while on the track. I was desperate to finish a chapter a day. that's why the early ones are so short, after about chapter twenty five, it was all Cafe hopping and me being able to concentrate fully.

The Bathhouse was a favourite location, quiet, and for three hours or so at a time, next to the lake and waves was amazing.
Then later on was Vudu Cafe, while having soup.
Then Starbucks on the corner.
Then also in frankton, Hamills Coffee.
Sometimes, when I was short on money I went to the Mall and sat there with a strawberry Milk and a chocolate bar.
This last section was written in MacDonalds, because I coudl set there for hours, and it's open 24/7/.
Elsie, Casey, Richard, and Kei followed us through all of these spots T_T

Thank you guys, you've stuck with me for over 100,000 words. And every word has been an absolute pleasure. (Thank you words as well, for sticking yourselves into this manuscript)

Please give as many comments on what you think, what you didn't like, and what you did like, what you thought could be better. 

Thank you again!!!

### Extra scenes

`raw notes that could be appended`

Put how in the story, the King has to give a password, solve a special riddle, then leaves with his Queen and his loyal servant friends, he flies out and carries them out to safety.

Lahoe says that this is his strength, because he is different. It's what he said to Jenkins, which came back.


Kei finally leaves.Warren follows Kei, and so does Israel. They both have nowhere to go, Kei doesn't want to tell them that they are following him, but he also doesn't know where to go. He eventually asks them to wait at a place in one of the respawn spots.


A player offers to send a message to the others, after he beats the game. (Long after it doesn't happen)
(End of this chapter go somewhere else and start new things, wonder why the strong players are playing if it is not to beat the game)
"It's because there's something here that they can't get in the real world." someone says, and then all three of them nod and agree. That must be it.

Casey says "I'm a bit pissed off right now" but she is speaking normally and smiling and things
"What? You are?" Great, now she was starting as well. Everyone seemed to be pissed off at someone  recently.
(She explains)

Extremely creative bonds of spontaneous thigns, she sends a rocket up with a letter inside. The rocket never makes it so they wonder why. But when they go to do their own rocket, they find her letter inside, it never left, she put it in the wrong rocket. etc. Spontaneous things, everything is interacting and alive. (Refer to grave chapter, he writes his name on the grave after reverting to level 1, then everyone sees it. Fireworks that they set off, he says it is same as credits, then when they do it, find her letter inside, and her confession letter.
(Show Casey's letter as empty back at the restaurant)


"Attack me" he said, "So I can go there right now and tell her, or else we might lose her"


(Statements of character and situation, and worries, and annoyments, "Well at least we know he's alive") When his level suddenly increases on the rankings chart. Although they can't find him.

"Don't think like that" I said, "We just need to find a way to make sure that we can log out as well." I led everyone to an open grass area, here we could train to fight easily, we could stay here and level up to 10, then would be able to leave.


(Guizan is also here to help them complete the game, they feel like fish writihing on the land in comparison to him, they try to do things, but nothing happens. Guizan has the ability to change everything instantly.) But he needs to defeat the top player first before that can be done.



"We've come so far" I said, "I don't even know what the lime green sword has to do with anything anymore, why are we leveling up still? Why don't we just atatck other players?"

"Don't say that" Casey said, "I've been thinking about it, and when you say that kind of thing, then I don't knwo what to think anymore, you argued with Elsie so much over that...just don't say it. You... " She shook her head, "Don't even mention it Kei"

"Okay" I said.

(This is Lahoe, transgender cross dresser, that's why no one coudl really describe him as male or female or either or.)

Heron talks about About Richard (insert names as you please)
"Ever since Elsie left, he's been out of it"
"Katie kept her on a leash" (Man's view"
"No...she just kept him motivated" (Women's view, Elsie talking about how Suze and Spaz seemed really close.) The proximity of teams brings players together in a romantic way,.



Heron asks him why Elsie is in his team
"That must have been before she joined with the top players"
He says she used to be with them
But after a while he starts saying that he also doesn't know why.
She has become famous after she left them, he feels a little bit bad about it, that she became famous after leaving them. Not sure if it is upset that she is famous without him, or that she is famous.

Kei sends a message to Jenkin's and everyone else, through fireworks. (Need somethign here !!!!!!!!!!)

Starts developing crushes with Casey, but Richard said that he always liked Elsie. When they learn of a place that they will be able to meet Elsie, Richard is overjoyed.

"yeah I'll be there" Elsie says.

Elsie has bloodlust. She apologizes and says she will go somewhere else. 


He remembers her voice, and he tells Kei and Casey about it, how wonderful she is.
(Enforce how much he likes her)

Talk starts to go around of how amazing Guizan is, how he is number 7, but is the most talented ranked player. The programmers who have met all of them say this. They haven't seen Lahoe, but Guizan is the most thoughtful and kind.

Become incredibly insecure around Guizan???

(Compare the ranks of the two, and show how Uizan wasn't supposed to be able to defeat Sheila)
(See the hunters again, they are at Heron's town, and have come to ask for jobs to do, now they are very weak. They say that that day they tried to make two graves, instead they made so many more)
Either way, the hunters will make sure that there are two graves here instead of one, and that two players will respawn)

She tries to console everyone 

People do things, when show kindness then feel more secure with others.

Richard likes Elsie, Kei says "What is good about her"

Richard starts answering, then Kei says "It wasn't a question"


Feels very shallow to be thinking these things and doing these things with others.

the duel after after duel

or the after duel after after duel.

"He's mastered it already" 

Fermol said, "He's already got the skill built up, much earlier than I thought." *Guizan is strong*
(Fermol says he hates Guizan) How can he live with so much dislike of someone, it is what has been fueling him through the game. (Put this back in chapter before he leaves Programemrs meeting)
Fermol:
She's a cheat, but wait, is she really that amazing looks?
Caught between appetite and reason. He is attracted to her when he finds out that she is still with the second strongest player.

Elsie disappeared again.
Rumours fly that The girl with the blue band on her leg, is so powerful, and she's now supporting Lahoe.

Strangely, everyone else they meet also notices her in the same way, with the blue band. But he doesn't see it.q


Hamish says about Elsie,  "She always communicates very clearly, and if he is quiet "Do you feel alright?"
Then kei agrees and says, "Yeah, that's right"
The Hamish says, "I do feel alright now though, better than I thought I would."

She gets upset and says "Go and help him, why aren't you doing so?"
(He was thinking about how nice this place is)
(She was thinking the other girl is busy)(Programmer's meeting)


(Guizan is a really good guy, believe that he is going to lose the battle)(Enforce it at the tabletop duel)

Lahoe visits spawning areas, for some reason he is finding someone who was recently defeated. Guizan predicted that this would happen, says that he is looking for Kei, the fated discovery." (He is looking for part of the things to deal with the leaving, looking for Casey) Kei knows who he is looking for is Casey. Kei doesn't lie and says where she is. But then Guizan is defeated and is too ashamed to go back to find her.



(He doesn't talk about how Casey cheated on him. Jenkins says that after a while he won't remember it anyway, so it doesn't matter.
SO if you don't remember then it doesn't matter?
“Kei, have you forgotten? This world is just a game, that's why you're wanting to leave right?”


Laura says that he just ran off with her. Actually it was she who ran off with him. Never really said bye. He wonders if there was somethign worth saying bye about.

The strongets player visits the spawning area and they all move away, they are no match for him, even if they all attack together, his green sword is sparkling through. He has come to visit Kei, for whatever reason. He tells them that the place they had the duel was actually a fmous location among high level players, because it's in the middle of the world, and it's visible for miles all around. Visibility becomes one of the most important things late in the game.

Have to revert everyone back to level 1 in order to restore the system to how it was supposed to be without this crazy leveling.
(The last chapter is the normal game and they all talk and say farewells)


("Remember how we used to be shocked by these things?")
They ask how these players leveled up so quickly, then are shocked to find out that it is by attacking other players. Conquest number is 10.
Then even more shocked to learn of clan members who sacrifice themselves to give one of their members the sword and power.
(Near the start)


(Casey is hurt when he speaks too directly, he needs to be more tactful about it) "Don't think like that" etc. (It's an ongoing pattern with Casey)


Casey is in her element at the kitchen, extremely good at cooking and serving people, her name starts to spread among everyone. Kei hears about her before he sees the restaurant, and notices how at home she is.

Elsie notices this and pretends not to care, but when they talk to Casey privately, she says that Elsie is always complaining that Casey gets all of the guys.
Casey is upset that they say this, then the others of course are all horrible. Even Richard doesn't support her. But Hamish comes in and stands up for Elsie, he says things that prove that he sees some things in Elsie that no one else is able to see.
(He says "She was crying last night whens he came back, she said some of her friends were saying bad things to her, so I told her that they're not her friends then" He glared at us. "Don't you dare hurt her feelings" Then even richard finds Hamish so cool.) 

a few chapters later, she goes and destroys Guizan? (Make readers feel passionate about Guizan)


They have Lahoe tagging behidn them like a puppy, and the slightly bigger puppy is Guizan. Also tagging along behidn them. Hardly knows how to socialize, and is nervous and shy. Warren and Israel as well, in the distance.

(Fireworks and Casey, a message that he sends to her through the frieworks, or a message that she has already sent to him, he asks her if she remembers how they met. (her answer to his confession) she's too shy to say it to his face) Makes him only able to see it after they have left. But she sends the wrong one up, instead, Jenkins fires his up and it lights up the message, saying yes, (Something cheesy between the two of them, the first thing he ever said to her. She remembers it clearly)
He knows he has to confess to Casey


People are all addicted to getting hits on youtube, becoming youtube sensations.
(Young kids are awesome, so pure) There's none of that here.

"I still have friends left over from the other games.

Robert speaks through the radio, announces the score.
We all say "Who said it"
"Robert?"
Kevin says "God"

What if Laura had a blank expression upon seeing the old master? What if he changed jsut a bit, but enough for her not to be abel to recognize him? This could be because she has become vain? Or it could be because he has become vain.

Flirting with the waitresses. They say he should/has to apologize to Casey. She would think it's weird.

(Laminating & Anxiety) Smells in the air, and negativity.

The girl he likes walks past him and says "Hi, Kei"
Then Casey says it is the same for her, then he realizes that she means him, he always says "Hi Casey" to her in the morning.
"It's harder for a girl" she said.
"Not just for a girl, for everyone, I laughed when she said that"


Players can't leave because of memory, but can they join? 


The Leaving Crew: (They each give an introduction of themselves)
Warren
Israel
Laura
Suze (Wants to meet mroe boys)
Spaz (The rest of the group hasnn't come)
The Super Earls
Lahoe
Elsie (Doesn't need a reason)
Richard
Heron
Casey
Fermol
Jake (At first didn't believe it, but doesn't want to be left behind, is convinced by Fermol to join.)
Sheila


Go past Richard's place but Heron says that he isn't there
Of maybe they never did fit together in the first place.
[When Elsie breaks down and loses, then evetything changes]
Hear from Richard, 


They go to a town, Richard gets a crush on one girl there who's the store keeper's daughter. But as soon as he sees Elsie his feeling changes. Richard is looking around at all of the girls.

"It's simple" another player low level says, (At the graveyard), but have wise advice, "It's because life, or this game life is about progress, and not about the goals"

### Feedback Session
 
When I was writing this story, I was in a sense reliving my High School classes where we analyzed great stories, so I also want to be able to raise questions that people and young readers can _hopefully_ deem worthy of analysis.

If you made it this far, would you mind answering some of these questions and emailing your responses to

Questions for readers:

_Choose 3 questions and answer them, you have twenty minutes to come up with a plan of attack to present it to the class_
 
- Why is Kei so against attacking other players? and why is Elsie wanting to attack other players so much, if it is because of leveling, then why does she want to level up so fast?
 
- How does the real world relate to this world that they are in? How similar or separate is it?
 
- Casey said, "We're all girls" in chapter ____, how do you feel that gender roles play throughout the book. How abotu when Elsie stood apart from everyone after diverging? Did she express herself clearly?
