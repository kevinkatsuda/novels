### Prologue 

In our line of work as an angel, there were sometimes imposters. These imposters would dress and act as an angel because they would be able to communicate with the other angels and find out what was happening. It was very rare, but it happened from time to time.

They were usually caused by angels who had gone against the order, betrayed the corporation without relinquishing their powers. We called them fallen angels. But I thought they were just a myth, I didn't think that they actually existed.

But now there were two Colessa's. there was only one way to find out which one was real.

"Colessa" I outstretched my hands to give her a hug. She smiled and embraced me back. "It's so nice to finally meet another angel" I said. 

"Me too, I've finally started another assignment, and this is our first time meeting isn't it?" She put her arms on my shoulders, "So tell me about what you do here? How have things progressed with Matt?"

"They're going great" I said. "He really trusts me now and listens to what I have to say" 

Colessa nodded, "That's great news Colita! You're doing your first mission really well"

My eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Really? Hontoou? Colessa, can you tell me the password Max told you to tell me?"

She laughed and shook her head, "What are you talking about? Don't you trust me?"

"I trust you" I said, "But we have to follow rules"

Her eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Have you fallen in love with Matt? Is that why you want to keep me away?"

Far out, she was a dirty minx. "No, why would you think that?" I smiled back, if I showed any emotion then I had lost this.

"I don't know the password" she said, "Max never told me it, if you're going to treat me badly because of that then you're no angel either."

"Don't you remember?" I said, "Just earlier today you were telling me that you hated me, now suddenly you care for me again?" I was making it up, but I wanted to see her reaction.

"What are you saying? I never talked to you, I met you just now. What's wrong Colita? Why are you treating me like this? Is there something you're suspicious of? Are there other angels here?"

I shivered, a cold wind blew past and wrapped my hair up. This girl wasn't Colessa, it was clear now. She was the imposter framing herself as Colessa, and she needed my trust to figure out if there were any other angels here.

I smiled, "Colessa, thank you, now I know you're it"

## Part I - The Maiden

### Chapter One - Colita the Hard Worker

_Guys, please give comments and feedback and what you think. I wanted to do something fun and not very serious, but I just duhnnnnnno... :( Anyways, check it out and...check it out....hehe_

I bet you've heard about __Angels__. They're usually these pretty white fairy-like creatures that smile and laugh and just always looking amazing, like they've just walked out of a fashion magazine.

Well it's true, we really are as pretty as it's hyped up to be. But it's not all roses,  in reality being one is hard work. I was learning the ropes of the job and I'm afraid it wasn't going too well. My ringtone vibrated like a mad bull, I picked up my phone and held it against my ear in a manner I knew all too well.

"Colita?" the voice on the other end said, that voice belonged to a figure called 'my boss' , he was the head angel, Max Maxy, the Chief Executive Officer of Angel Corp.

"Yes?" I tried to sound as nice as possible, but I knew what was coming and today niceness was just not going to cut it. Well, a girl had to start somewhere.

"I heard you failed another mission again young lady"

If I rehearsed Max saying those words in my head a thousand hundred times, it woudl have sounded exactly the way he said it without any change. It wasn't good. Except for young lady, I wasn't young any more.

"Are you sure? How do you know? I completed the mission" I stalled for time,"I put the two who were meant to be together together"

There was a sigh on the other end, "Colita, this is the third mission in a row that you've failed, you can't just put people together because you feel like it, you have to follow the manual. Stop giving me excuses of this and that, you're just a bad angel."

Gee, that was harsh, even a bad angel wouldn't want to hear that. "That's because you keep giving me the hard jobs" I said, "Half the people who are supposed to be put together look like dinosaurs, so of course I won't emotionally connect with them, I put the ones who deserve to be together together. You need to give me proper couples who are supposed to be together, none of this bonding with dinosaurs and apes and chimpanzees. We're not a zoo service."
 
"We're not a zoo service"He repeated

"Exactly, we're not." I said

"Yup, we're not."He said.

Well, this was a really productive conversation...

Angel Corp's main job was like a dating agency, we never advertised it as such, but most of our jobs were to do with getting all sorts of couples together, like cupids. Of course, we had high aims and our motto was some kind of touching nonsense that did great world good, but getting down to it, we just were a group of angels who misused our powers to create love.

"Colita, Mirana never fails her missions, she does them and double checks everything to make sure it's fine and fits, and everyone is happy in the end, why don't you learn from her?"

He was comparing me to Mirana? Mirana entered the agency at the same time as me, we were the same height and stuff. But unlike me, she was excellent. She got the job done and still had everyone in love by the end of it. Everyone told me that I should be more like her. Around Mirana love was in the air. Around me...well, there wasn't much.

"I'm not Mirana" I said, "So stop comparing me to her. I tried my best on those missions and thought the result was good, did you see my stats?"

"Don't worry, I won't fire you" Max said. I could hear a smile in his voice. "Well, not yet anyway, you have one last chance."

He was giving me one last chance to set things right, to prove that I was a capable angel. "I will try my best, but don't expect me to join weird couples together again"

"This one's a bit different" he said, "It's a bit unusual actually. Do you think you can do it?"

I nodded, then realizing he couldn't hear my nod through the phone, blurted out, "I'll take it" I couldn't fail again.

"This mission's a bit long and you have to follow my instructions word for word, no streaking off to the side like you always do" he said. "Are you sure you want to do it?"

"I'll do it, but when you say long, how long?" 

"A year"

I felt a bead of sweat drip from my hand onto the receiver. "A year...?"

"Well, it's a bit less if you put it all the holidays and time off, maybe about ten months"

I fell silent, why did this have to be the only mission available to me. I couldn't go away for a year; I had relationships to maintain, family bonds to cultivate, pets to nurture, and a face to keep pretty. Who knew what a year around more of these rough dinosaurs would do to me. They sucked out all of my energy.

"Max, is there any way we can make it shorter? I promise I'll do a good job, I mean I'll really try; but a year of my life dedicated to a mission is..." I couldn't say the idea sucked, but it was as close to sucking as it got. "I'll be old!"

"Well" Max said, "We're running a bit low on jobs right now so this is all we have, the high priority jobs were given to more important angels."

Ugh, he said it so directly, of course I was an unimportant-in-the way angel. All of the good jobs were given to Mirana, she knew what she was doing. I was just a newbie angel given the rubbish jobs.

"Okay" I said, "I'll take it."

Max didn't accept me easily, "Colita, you realize that you can't come back here until you finish the job? You realize that your pets and animals and hobbies are going to have to wait? You can't just skip out on the job one day because you feel like it, and you have to do exactly as you are told"

I cast my hand out, this was my biggest assignment yet. "Do I have any other choice? You won't give me any other mission"

"Yeah" Max said, "Not really"

"Well then I have to take it?" 

"Good?" Max said, "I think you'll be perfect for the job anyway. Your spontaneity will be perfect." I heard some paperwork being shifted on the other end,  "Come over tomorrow, we'll provide you with a uniform and some text-books."

"Uniform and text-books?" What did I need those for? I didn't know of any mission with books and clothes.

Max chuckled, "Oh sorry, I forgot to tell you, you're going to be going to a high school."

"I'm going to a high school?!! Of all the places you could send me, you're making me go to a human school? For a whole year?"

"Well, it's ten months" he said.

"I'm going to a human school full of immature brats for ten months?" I said. "I'd rather die"

"You're going to a local high school, so we need to prepare you for it with uniform and proper etiquette."

"High school?" Why did it have to be a high school? Surely there was anywhere else in the world more useful for an angel than a high school? I could be saving worlds, bringing joy to peoples' hearts.

"We're going to have you enrol as one of the students and help us solve some issues"

Oh no, this was going to be absolutely the worst. Issues in high school were petty problems like relationships that lasted for a day, popularity issues, and PUBERTY<<<

Max spoke away from the receiver, "You've been to these high schools right?'

"No" I said, "Not once, but I've heard enough horror stories from my friends."

"Well then, you might enjoy it" he said. "And remember not to act out on your own, you know what happened when you did last time"

"You sent me to a high school"

Max laughed, "It looks like I've finally given you something you care about Colita, do your very best"

This was not good, it was very very bad. I waved goodbye to my turtle 'turtle', my two dogs, and my three cats. My four elephants were also looking sad, I made the five ponies take care of them.

"Be well, pets" I frowned, "Be well, I won't be back for a year. BYE Foosie, bye Flower, Bye Lala, and bye, the cuuuteeeesssst one of all, Mickey! "

My cutie pies begged at me with love in their eyes.

Awwwwwwwwww soo cuttteee, I was soooo going to miss my ccccuuutttiiiees

I bet they were happy for me.

### Chapter Two - Colita the Student 

So do you kinda see where this is going, it's a high school story after all, I just wanted to try it lol. But Colita's not a normal HS girl, she's about twice the age of her classmates...

Now I never told you about the work us angels do, but we're basically mediators for humans. Whenever there are issues, we are sent in to deal with them and create a loving peaceful atmosphere conducive to a better world. But the issues that would happen in high school, I groaned just thinking about it. I had no idea about what boys thought, but the things that plagued teenage girls' minds were crazy, fashionable shoe sizes, height, popularity, and most of all, boy problems. Ugh it was so immature. I thought I finally escaped from it.

Colita, what have you done to deserve going back to school as thirty two? What is happening with your life? You're supposed to move through life forwards, but are you going backwards now? I looked down at my feet to check which way I was walking.

"Are you ok?" Jenny, the stationary manager adjusted her glasses. "What are you talking to yourself and walking backwards for?"

I scratched my head, "I'm going away for a year, to a high school!" I said.

Jenny was a slim woman about my age, and she always wore a black business dress with a grey jacket over the top. She always looked serious, and when she laughed, she looked serious.

"Colita, you're so funny" she said, looking serious. “It's just a job, get over it”

“It's easy for you to say, you're not the one who has to go”

“I would love to go” she said.


"I'm funny?" I stuck out my lips, "You're funny. I need to grow up, I'm already thirty two! It's nothing to laugh about, it's humiliating."

"Grow up then" she said. 

"But I'm going back to school, how can I grow up"

"You might learn something interesting" Jenny looked at the roof and her eyes shut, as if struck by a sudden gust of inspiration. "When I was in high school I met a man, my first love, he was the man I let slip away, and have regretted it ever since to this day"

"Jenny" I said, "We're in the office"

She opened her eyes and got out the uniform I was to wear. It was tiny and small, the shirt was skinny. "This is your uniform" 

"I'm not wearing that, I'm a grown woman" My boobs were too big to fit into that skimpy little white shirt.

Jenny looked up at the roof again, dreamy as a salad diet, “When I was in University, I met a man who told me that, I fell for him so hard, and when we were walking under a starry sky...”

“Jenny” I said, “Office? Remember?”

She snapped out of it, "That's not all" She turned and fetched a piece of cloth from the rack. 

We got handkerchiefs too? I didn't know handkerchiefs were still used, we just used magic to clean ourselves, and when we got fat from lack of movement, we used magic to thin ourselves down, and when we became unhealthy we used magic to 'healthify' ourselves. There was no room in our lives for handkerchiefs, they should eb placed in the 'obsolete' box with love and all that. "Where do I put that?" I tried to put it in my shirt pocket.

"You don't put it there, it covers your bum" Jenny said, "It's a skirt."

I froze, this piece of fabric called a skirt was barely bigger than my butt, it would barely conceal my legs. "I can't wear that, I can't, I sooo can't, look at how short it is." 

Jenny tipped her glasses closer to her eyes, "That's what girls these days wear to school, it's the fashion" Jenny said, "And stop speaking like that, you're a grown woman remember?"

This was THE most humiliating thing POSSIBLE. Why was I going to a school that wore such revealing clothing as a uniform? School was a place for study, this made it look like a strip bar. How could anyone study in such an environment.

I thought about putting on stockings underneath to cover up some of the skin, or just forgetting about it and wearing pants.

"You can do anything you want" Jenny made me stand in front of the mirror. "I was told that you had to wear this, as long as you wear the uniform then Max won't mind" 

I sobbed, why did I have to be on this mission...

Now came the hard part. "Change" Jenny said, "Turn into a young student"

Every decent angel had the powers to shape-shift, it was commonsense not to reveal your true appearance to a human. Jenny made me try out a few looks but she wasn't satisfied. 

"You need to be less like yourself" she said, "Can you change into something a little... more flashy?

“Flashy?” I said. “What does that mean?”

“Younger"

"I'm old?" It was a sensitive topic. "I'm thirty two you know, I have most of my life ahead of me, I'm just a spring chicken"

Jenny softened down, looking serious. "No darling, you know I don't mean that, although we're both kinda old by human standards..." 

I bit my lip. "I'm not old"

Jenny sniffed, "Fine, even though we're the same age; you're not old, but I am okay? Does that make you feel better?" She pointed to my angel necklace, the necklace that angels wore all the time. "Use your powers to change into a seventeen year old girl"

I sighed and spun around three times, when I looked back in the mirror I saw a girl almost half my age. 

Jenny was stunned, "You look amazing, that's what we need."

"Thank you" It was hard to acknowledge that I had to spin three times and use my angel powers to have to be told that, but it was a compliment and those were rare, These days I took all of the compliments I could find. They were the words that led us on the path to confidence.

I saw a schoolgirl staring back at me, I didn't feel like an angel anymore. I made poses in front of the mirror, checking out this new body. It was a refreshing change, for once I actually looked kinda pretty.

"So I know I have to go to the school and all, but what's my assignment?" I sat down in the chair beside Jenny making sure to smooth out my skirt and let it cover as much of me as possible.

Jenny looked over her notes, "It says you need to befriend someone called 'The Beast'"

I groaned, "And just who is this beast you speak of? Is he in this high school?"

Jenny laughed and pointed to her notes, "I don't know, that's all it says here, go find out who the beast is and befriend them, it's as simple as that, an easy mission, a dance in the rain." She stood up and her heels stabbed the floor to the door. The floor had been littered with holes in that direction, Jenny had been working here a long time. "Head on your way now, hope it all goes well" She gave me a perfect fake smile.

I tried to smile, "Thanks Jenny, I'm going to miss you"

"It's just a year" Jenny said, "What's a year in a woman's life, you've just started to blossom, for an angel thirty is the new fifty."

"I look seventeen, but thanks" I looked in the mirror one last time and adjusted my skirt by pulling it down further. Did girls these days really wear this sort of stuff? I looked over myself once more and wasn't impressed. What if I went to the school and everyone stared at the weird uniform I was wearing? What if it was a big joke and I was the only one dressed like this...

Jenny pushed me out "Go on" she said, "Go to school now" Jenny held the door open for me.

"You look amazing Colita" She said as I stepped out, I was surprised by how much I hesitated.

"No I don't" I hurried out to get to this school. It was time to befriend the beast.

"You haven't forgotten how to be human have you?" Jenny said.

"No, silly" I pulled out my headphones, for some reason there was only one song on them, and the one song was the most important to me in the world. "It's what I always feel" I said. This was one of the songs that reminded me of youth, and made me feel closer to a human, it was "Beautiful" By Ms. Christina Aguilera.

Don't look at me, 
Everyday is so wonderful, then suddenly it's hard to breathe...

"Stop singing" Jenny came over and took my headphones off. "Focus, okay Colita? You're going to be starting your job now, you can't muck around anymore."

"Okay, okay" I said. I was only listening to the music to ease the tension, maybe if I listened to human music I might fit in with humans easier.

"Who knows" Jenny showed me her smile again, "You may learn something on this journey. Humans are full of things to learn about, the best angels learn the most from humans, they're a complicated species."

"So go and talk to the beast" Jenny pushed me out the door and looked out from it half shut. "I'm going to watch a movie now, Max finally gave me some time off, so you do your job okay?"

Ugh, it was sooo cheesy. Who called them self 'the beast' anyway?

_So, there's going to be music accompanying this work. I think it's important, at least I try to listen to music because it helps things flow. (It's all bad anyway) But still, there's a Japanese anime dude called Shinichiro Watanabe who accompanies things with music, so I was thinking of doing something like that too. Thanks, cheers!
HEHEHEE_

### Chapter Three - Nathan

_There was to be boys here. But, I'm not confident that I got how girl's talk and do things, so girls out there, would you so kindly be willing to give some valuable feedbacks? To this young spring chicken!!!_

I checked the mirror again, I wasn't used to this face, it looked so different, I had blonde hair and blue eyes. In reality though, I had black hair and brown eyes, and my dresses were all two sizes bigger. Then I wondered if people would find me pretty, this foreign face, is this what they thought was pretty.

Some part of me hoped that they would say they didn't like this face, that it wasn't natural, then I would be able to wear my normal face, my real angel face. It was a big debate among angels, everyone wanted to be accepted for who they were, but yet we all disguised ourselves all the time.

When I walked through the school gates there were glares from everywhere, the students were staring at me. I looked over myself, did I look weird? Did I leave some part of the uniform out? Was my skirt too short? Why was everyone staring like I was some zoo animal?

But it wasn't my uniform, in fact, my mini-skirt turned out to be longer than some of the other girls were wearing. Some of these girls walked around with skirts so short that ___________. I felt weird, then why was everyone staring?

My classroom was on the third floor, and the bell rang just as I got to it. Everyone was inside the classroom. I stood in front of the door and suddenly felt nervous. This was a room full of people that I was about to walk into, and I had such a short skirt on.

I instinctively pulled my skirt down a fraction lower. If I pulled it down any lower the top of my butt would show. I took a deep breath in and slid the door open.

Thirty faces looked at me blankly. I tried to smile, but all I did was make an awkward grin...this was so much more nerve-wracking than I imagined. These were high school kids, why was I so unconfident. I had walked into bigger rooms before with more people, all of them more mature.

"You must be Colita" The teacher stood beside me and spoke warmly. "I'm Mr. Ledger"

"Oh, I'm Colita" I said. 

"Where are you from?" he smiled, "Why don't you introduce yourself to the class?"

I turned to the class, running through all of the notes I had memorized. "My name is Colita Reedings, I was born in Browns Bay on the North Shore, but my parents had a hard time financially, so they took me as a baby to Nelson, and Hamilton, and I moved to Devonport a few days ago. I've never had a boyfriend, and have always been single.”

The class started laughing. One guy in the front was staring at me quietly with his head resting on his chin. his eyes were really cold, and all around him were the rest of the class.

"You don't have to tell us your relationship status, just where you're from, that's why everyone's laughing." Mr. Ledger said. "Anything else you want to add Colita?"

"Okay" I looked down at the ground, this was way more embarrassing than I imagined. "Umm...this is my first time in a school, so I'm excited to meet all of you"

The class burst out laughing again. The student in the front was still staring at me silently.

I looked around, what were they laughing about now?

"It's your first time in a school?" one of the guys said, "Have you been living in a cave your whole life?"

"What? No!" I said, why would they think so.

"What are your hobbies?" someone said.

"Smoking" I said. The class laughed again. I only found it puzzling, why were they laughing at everything I was saying? “And having fun”

The class went by slow as a snail, when the bell rang, everyone came over to ask me questions. I answered them with all of the things I had memorized, the things Max told me to say.

One girl offered to have lunch with me. "If you're free, do you want to eat together?" she said. I learnt her name was Julia, and she had grown up here since young. She said that everyone laughed because I the things I said were really interesting.

We sat at one of the tables in the corner. I noticed that there were a lot of people gathered around a few of the tables in the middle

"Those are the popular tables" Julia said, "They won't let us sit there" Then Julia pointed out a couple at the table. "That's Matt and Lacey" she said, "They're the 'it' couple."

"The 'it' couple?" I shrugged.

Julia grinned, "You don't know about 'it' couples? Every school has one, I guess it really is your first time in a school, we all thought you were joking, but maybe you were actually living in a cave." She explained what 'it' couples were holding her juice carton in one hand and explaining carefully with the other. "They're the super popular couple, everyone wants to be them and be with them. Matt is so good looking that's it's ridiculous, and Lacey, she's so pretty that even university guys ask her out. She's got all the most expensive brand make-up and clothes. They're at a level we'll never be able to be." Julia shook her head.  

I felt sleepy and yawned, this was all going way over my head. I didn't care about 'it' couples, and this high school popularity stuff. I just wanted to get my job done so I could go home and smoke.

"Are you listening Colita?" Julia said, "They're really a big deal"

"I'm listening" I said, "But I don't see how they're so impressive, they're just some rich kids right?"

Julia was shocked "They're not just some rich kids, they're the rich kids."

I decided to dive straight into what I wanted to know. "Julia, I was wondering if you knew someone called the 'beast'?" I felt silly to even be mentioning something like a beast, but as soon as I saw Julia's reaction I knew I had struck gold. 

Her eyes widened and she smiled,  "That's exactly what I'm talking about" she said, "Matt, Lacey's boyfriend, the coolest, hottest guy in school, he's called the beast"

I pointed to him just to make sure we were talking about the same person, "You mean that Matt, next to the girl as skinny as a pencil?"

Julia put my finger down. "Don't point" she hissed, "You'll be seen by them"

"So?" I really didn't get this popularity stuff, all I was here for was a mission. 

"If you want a boyfriend" Julia grabbed my chin and turned my head, "Look over there, that table full of boys, that's where you can look for one, we call that table the meat-market"

She showed me a table full of meaty guys joking about something one of them said. They looked like they all played sports. They also looked back frequently. “How come they're looking at us?”

“Because our table is called the bag-storage” She showed me how the guys' bnags were lying around and some girls were taking care of them.

I turned away, "I'm not interested, in all these boys and all these girls."

Julia's jaw dropped. "Colita Reedings" she said, "That table over there is the finest sample of boys our school has to offer"

"I'm not here for boys" I said. "I'm here to work" I couldn't blow my cover, "I mean, I'm here to do what all kids do at these schools, and that's study, I'm here to study"

Julia stared at me with a smile, "You're so cute, the way you say that"
 
"you want to study me?" There was a voice behind me, I snapped around to see a guy with a huge cheeky grin. He pulled out the chair beside me and sat down, moving his arm close to touch my drink. I flinched, he was way too close.

"Nathan!" Julia was staring hard, waaay too hard. It was so obvious.

"Hi Julia" he smiled at her briefly, then turned to me, coming even closer, I could feel his breathing on my ear. A cold chill ran down my back, this was sooo awkward, what was he doing? This was right in front of everyone, I didn't even know him.

"What's your name?" he said.

The attention of the whole cafeteria was on us. When this boy sat down, he dragged the attention of everyone here.

"What's it got to do with you?" I said.

"I was wondering if you want to go to the movies" He leaned back, giving me some space. "Just you and me of course"

I stared at him, what was he thinking, asking me, a thirty two year old woman out on a date...I slapped my forehead, that's right, everyone here thought I was a seventeen year old girl. Even so, it felt so weird...he didn't even know my name.

"So that's a yes?" he said.

Julia came to my aid. "Do you even know her name?" she said.

Nathan looked at me, "Is it goddess?"

I almost choked on the potato I was eating, was he serious? Was that supposed to attract girls? 

"What's wrong, I'm hot right?" Nathan said, "You're hot too, so we should get together"

I raised my hand in front of him, "Umm, no thanks, sorry but I don't date strangers."

Nathan's eyes widened, "I'm not a stranger" he said. "Do you see what's in front of you? We're perfect for each other." He stood up. "Let me re-do this" he held out his hand for me to shake, "I'm Nathan, I like to read romance novels and play soccer. I'm not a stranger, I'm actually a really nice guy if you get to know me" He grinned, "So... shake?"

He was kinda cool, once he stopped wearing that I'm-all-that face. I took his hand and shook it. "Okay" I said.

“How about you?” He pulled out the chair beside me and sat down, with his hands under his chin, eagerly wanting to hear what I had to say. “Tell me about yourself”

“I'm a student” I said, “At this school”

He laughed, “Oh is that why you're wearing that uniform? I was wondering why.” He moved closer, “But tell me about your talents”

“Umm...” What human talents did I have, I quickly made a scan, I could just make something up right? “I'm a kind person” I said.

He laughed again, for some reason he was really enjoying this. 

“What about you?” I said, “What's your talent?”



"I have an eye for pretty girls" he smoothed his hair back, "That's one of my talents"

"It is" I agreed, I dug my fork into a potato.

"So do you want to meet this Friday? I'll come and pick you up"

I held my hand out and continued eating "No thanks"

“What, even after all that?I felt a connection between us” 
I was getting sick of him, he was so full of himself that he couldn't breathe anything else. I picked up the next potato and stuck it on my fork. But Nathan didn't leave. I turned to Julia. "Julia, you date right?" 

Julia blushed, "Well, kind of, I guess so...though I've never had a boyfriend"

"Perfect" I gave Nathan a big smile, "Julia's free on Friday, I'm sure she would love to go out with you, maybe just once, until she realizes the shallowness of your personality"

Nathan took that as a compliment, he looked at me, then her, "How about both of you?" He held his hand up, "Wait, listen to this" He breathed in, then let out a huge burp. 

"Eww, that's so gross" Julia covered up her face, but couldn't stop smiling. "Do you realize that was really disgusting?"

"So, tonight?" he looked back at me.

"No" I shook my head and picked up another potato. “I'm not interested” He stood up and left, back to where he came from, that table full of jocks.

Julia was still looking over to that table five minutes later, "He was so into you, why didn't you say yes?"

"He's a douche" I said.

"He was kinda cute" Julia said, "Don't you think?"

"Not really" I scratched my hair and finished the last of my food. 

"You could have gone out with him" I said.

Julia looked down, "He wasn't interested in me, he only had eyes for you"

We both put our empty trays away. Julia's wasn't very empty, she left a lot of food.

"We'll find you a boyfriend" I said.

"Where are you going now?" she wiped the scraps of food off.

"I'm going to talk to the beast" I said.

"What, really?" She sounded really excited about something so dull. "Can I come too?" 

"Sure?" I didn't know why she wanted to come along, it was just a chat, "I want to become his friend." I walked towards the 'it' couple's table, but Julia grabbed my hand and stopped me.

"Colita, you're so cool!" she said, "I'm so glad you came to this school"

"Thanks" I couldn't tell her I wasn't a proper student, I couldn't say that I was thirty two year old delinquent angel who was too antisocial to be married or in a relationship. I just grinned and took the compliment. Like I said, they didn't come easy these days.

### Chapter Four - The Beast is called Matt

_Hehehe....I can't stop laughing....someone! Stop me from laughing!!!!! Pleeeassee_

My eyes were focused on the prey at hand. I had to befriend the beast, that was all I had to do. I had learnt that his name was Matt. I had learnt that he was rich. But I didn't know what he had to do with Angel Corp. 

We walked over to the popular table, Julia close in tow behind me. When Nathan had approached our table everyone wondered what Nathan was doing at our table. But when I walked over to the 'it' couple's table, it was a bit different. Every single head in the vicinity looked. Guys stopped laughing at stupid disgusting jokes, girls stopped eating, and the girls who had already stopped eating due to dietary reasons stopped breathing.

Julia pulled on my sleeve as we got closer. "I don't think this is a good idea" she said, "He's called the beast for a reason"

I didn't see what she was so afraid of, and why was everyone staring? It was kind of annoying, I just wanted to have a proper conversation, to state my terms for a friendship. But as I got closer, I saw a stare that was the hardest and the most menacing. It was from the girl next to Matt. Lacey looked like she was going to stab me and hang me upside down. She was trying to act normal, but seeing me approaching was too much for her and she stared me down like I was a wild beast invading her territory.

But I wasn't the beast here, I put my hands on my hips and stood in front of Matt. "Are you the beast?" I said.

Matt looked up, he smiled, "What are you doing here?" he said. Lacey tugged on his shirt, 

"Tell them Matt" she hissed. She looked around at the stares of all the people around us then back at me. "This is our table"

I sniffed to clear up my nose, "Are you the beast?"

Matt looked around at the others on the table, "What's she asking all of a sudden, she's so weird" They all laughed. Then I joined in and laughed too.

"You're hot" one guy said, "Come sit down" He pulled out a chair, and the guys moved over like they were connected by the waist. The girls didn't look too pleased, but I shook my head.

"I'm looking for the beast" I said, "Are you the beast?"

Lacey whispered something his ear, and he spoke, “This is Lacey and my table, I'm with Lacey”

He was so obviously repeating what she told him to...

Matt leaned forward with his hands together. "Are you attracted to beasts?"

He must have said something funny because everyone burst out laughing, everyone except Lacey who pinched Matt. "Don't say that" She turned back to me with ehr death stare. 

"If you are the beast, then I want to be your friend."

"You're so weird" one of the guys said. "But I dig weird girls, Come sit down"

"No, this is our table" Lacey said, "Don't offer her a space" she turned to me, "You need to leave. Now" I felt Julia tugging me from behind, begging me to leave. 

"Can we be friends?" I asked Matt. I didn't care about some popularity contest or whatever, I just had to befriend this guy who called himself the beast.

Lacey looked to Matt, "Tell her what you tell me every hour" she said "Tell her you're in love with me" she turned to me "He likes me, I'm sorry"

"I'm asking Matt, not you" I groaned, this was so tiring, what was with this girl. She had to butt into everyone's business.

Matt looked up at me, he stared quietly, as if in deep rumination. His hands were against his chin and his eyes stared at me coldly. "Sure" he said, "I'll be your friend" 

I heard gasps, not just from our table, but from all around. It was like we were in a TV show or something, everyone knew what was happening. This high school was so small and Matt was the singularity.

"Okay, great" I turned around. That was kinda easy.

"She's satisfied, she's leaving" One of the guys said. I gave him a death stare of my own before resolutely walking back.

"How did you do that?" Julia said, "How did you make Matt agree?"

"I just asked him a question" I said, "What's so surprising about that?" 

She grabbed my hand, "Do you know why Matt is called 'the beast'? It's because he is the cruelest most foul person in this school. He steps on girls' feelings, and ignores everyone around him. He even treats Lacey like crap a lot of the time"

"He's just another arrogant boy" I said. "Nothing special nothing new, if I don't give him any feelings he'll have nothing to step on."

"How did you get the courage to talk to Matt?" she said, "I'm always too shy to talk like you do, so freely"

"I don't know, I just don't really care what they think of me, you know?" I said, "Maybe that's why"

Julia stared at me with sparks in her eyes, I had just made her world. "That was so cool Colita, you were amazing. I wish I could be more like you."

I looked away, "Stop it, I'm not a person you would want to be like"

Julia looked at me, "I don't know why you want to become his friend, but he actually responded, so you've gone further than any other girl has managed. Why do you want to be his friend though?"

I couldn't answer that one, so I changed the subject. "Julia, do you like Matt?"

"He's so cool, it's everyone's dream to be with a guy like him. He's hot and really rich."

"I guess so" I scratched my earlobe, I also wanted to pick my nose. “But he's not a very kind person”

"I'm so glad to be your friend" she said, "You're so different to everyone I know"

"Yeah, great" my nose was itching like a mosquito on steroids had given me a bite. I looked around, everyone was watching, oh whatever if it had to be scratched, it had to be scratched. I picked my nose and welcomed one of the most amazing feelings of my life.

Julia stared at me with her mouth open. "Colita, you can't pick your nose in public"

"Who cares" I flung the snot off my finger and into the air.

"Everyone's watching"

I shrugged, I just really didn't care what they thought or what they didn't think. I was sick of being here. 

"Matt's watching" Julia pointed up the stairs, Matt was walking with Lacey, she was talking to him about something, and he was watching me.

I curled my fingers and gave him a wave. He ignored me and walked on. I grunted and sat on the stairs. Becoming friends with him might be a bit difficult.

Julia came and sat beside me, she pointed to her nose. "My nose is itchy, can I scratch it too?"

"Go ahead" I said. 

Julia did it, and turned around to see Matt in front of us. Lacey was beside him. Julia fainted when she saw them, then revived to hear him speak.

"That's disgusting, did you just pick your nose?" He shook his head. "What are you doing in this school?"

Julia turned bright red like a tomato and became fascinated by the marks in the floor.

"Hi, Matt" I smiled. "Nice to see you again" Julia tried to grin as well, but her finger was still in stuck in her nose, she had a lot to deal with at the moment. She sorted it out one step at a time.

Matt stared at me, 

"What are you thinking Matt?" I said, "Or should I call you the beast? Of course, whichever you like more."

"You're so weird" he said, "No girl just comes up and talks to me, they're usually too scared or something"

"What should I be scared of?" I said, "Should I be scared of you calling me your beastness?"

"I'm not a beast" Matt said, "That's just what everyone started calling me" He looked kind of vulnerable, and his coolness was gone for just a second.

Lacey stepped in between us, she looked at both of us then took Matt's arm and tried to take him away, but Matt let go of her, he was still looking at me.

"I don't want you to call me a beast" he said, "Call me Matt"

I grinned, he had matured, "Wow, you're okay with that? You won't look as cool as you were just now"

"Don't get the wrong idea" he said, "I'm not into you, I've seen a ton of girls who are prettier and smarter than you, I'm not interested in you, I just don't want you to be calling me the beast, anyone else can though."

Who was he to speak to me like that, like I was dying to be with him or something. If I had a chocice I wouldn't even breathe the same air that he was breathing. I groaned, I couldn't tell him that, I so wished I could.

"I don't like you" I said, "I don't know what other girls think of you, if they can't resist you or whatever, but I don't care okay, actually I really dislike you and find the way you talk to me extremely rude."

Matt was mostly expressionless, but his eyes widened slightly when I said that. "What did you say? Do you realize who I am?"

"What, are you surprised? Do people not usually talk to you like this? Am I supposed to bow at your feet and wipe your shoes clean?"

He grinned, "That would be nice" Lacey stepped forward, now that she was standing I saw that her skirt was really short, and her legs were skinny. Also, she had a strong smell of perfume that followed her wherever she went. It competed with her shadow.

"You don't have my permission" she said, "To talk to Matt."

Was he her dog? "I'm not talking to him, he's talking to me"

“No, I saw you talking to him just now”

“Yes, but he started talking to me first, I don't want to be rude”

Lacey made a face, "Oh, I'm so sorry, who are you? You're just some bimbo girl who picks her nose in front of everyone without shame, you ruin the scenery, get lost!" 

I was so glad I wasn't a human here. If I was, I wouldn't be able to hold myself back from charging at her.

She crossed her arms and tipped her nose up as if showing me her nostrils were clean, "Tell me, why do you want to be Matt's friend."

"Well then you tell him I don't want to be his friend anymore, it's not worth it, not with the crazy witch he has around him" I turned to leave but Lacey stepped in front of me.

"Then why did you approach him, did you want to steal him from me?" I saw Matt looking at me behind her, except he wasn't looking at my face, he was staring at my chest. I guess it was well developed compared to these teen girls. I shook my head, I was supposed to be arguing right now.

"I don't want to steal him" I said, "In fact, can't he even talk for himself? I was talking to him, not you. You don't have to keep blocking me" 

Lacey stood her ground

"I regret ever saying I want to be his friend" I said, "In fact, I think he's rude and disgusting, I don't want to be his friend at all."

"Come" Matt pulled Lacey away, "Let's go"

"She insulted you" Lacey said, "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Matt looked back at me once more then turned back, "No"

Lacey stamped her foot and started whining, "Why not, you're so mean"

Wow, she was really a piece of work. I hurried outside to get a breath of fresh air.

Julia stared at me amazed. "You dealt with Lacey, that hasn't happened before."

"It's not difficult" I said, "You just have to not care"

I picked up my necklace, and looked at it carefully, just to remind myself that I was an angel, not a student. I shouldn't get caught up in this.

"What's that?" Julia peered at my necklace. "It's so pretty"

"It's something very special" I said. "A childhood present"

Thanks for reading guys :) What do you think of Matt? What kind of person do you think he will turn out to be ?

### Chapter Five - Jason the friend

That night I called up the agency, I was sick of this mission, this Matt character was the lowest type of human, he had no respect for others. And his girlfriend Lacey, she was so annoying. Arghhh, it gave me stress just thinking about it, and stress made you age faster, and aging faster meant I would be die early, and dying early meant I wouldn't be able to become a proper angel.

Here's a bit of an interjection from the author, who for whatever reason that may or may not be important decided to include the following trivial facts:

You may or may not know this, but angel's are not classified as humans. In the sixth edition of the list of the world's magical creatures, angels are officially listed as a separate entity.

Now for all of you people who have never met angels before it may not mean much, but if you've met an angel, and you know how sweet of people we are, then you might  know what we can do to help these angels.

I'll leave you to think about it. 


Now moving on, us angels are taught to memorize these rules in school:

     1	An angel lives about three times as long as a human does. So, in general, a year in human life is approximately three or four months of an angel's lifespan. 

     2	An angel has a special power which lets them heal others around them, if someone is hurt, then an angel can heal it, that's what makes them so special to society. However, this can only be done if and only if an angel is in possession of the blue necklace that allows them to do so.

     3	Angels are all kind, every single one of us, we are nice to everyone and never swear. We respect every person's privacy and space with an understanding that these are essential to a standard quality of life that every life deserves to have.

     4	No matter what happens, angels are not allowed to use their healing powers outside of the agency for whatever reason, even if they are on a mission

     5	Lastly, angel's only mate once in their lifetime. By mate, I don't mean the ooky dooey lovey dovey stuff, I mean the snap of the fingers and the deed is done kind of thing. If you don't know what I mean, I won't explain it, but go and watch discovery channel and national geographic (This isn't advertising, well, it kinda is, but not really...)

The author says thanks and complies to move on to the Colita's story:
(Please wait a moment while we untie him and sedate him)

*

*


Even if I lived longer than humans, it didn't mean that I was happy to waste my life in a high school which I had nothing to do with. I was here purely for professional purposes. I don't know what Max wanted, but I had to befriend the beast, and I guess I hadn't even done that.

I lay down on the couch looking at the roof. The high school was a circus, those two kids Matt and Lacey were out of control. Everyone only cared about their popularity and how they looked. I whipped out a ciggie, lit it up and chucked it in my mouth. The smoke filled the room, I breathed it in deeply, letting it soak into every part of me, then let it out.

This was the best.

The phone rang, I picked it up immediately. 

"Colita?" Max said, "How was your first day at school?"

"Boring"

He laughed, "That's what all kids say, my kids say it as well."

I wasn't a kid...

"What do I have to do next?" 

"Well, Colita, to be honest, you haven't achieved your task yet"

"What do you mean?" I dropped the cigarette on the carpet and smudged it out, it would probably leave a stain but I didn't care. "I went to the school and talked to the snobby stuck up kid like you wanted me to."

"I told you to befriend him" Max said, "Not to make enemies with him..." He trailed off.

I wondered how he knew what I was doing, where did he get this information from? "Who is this boy anyway? Why does he get to act like some high and mighty kid when he's just barely got himself out of his nappies." Was this what all High school boys were like?

"Colita" Max said, "You have to befriend him, it's the only thing you have to do, so do it."

"You've got to be kidding, that kid hates me"

"That kid..." Max stopped mid-sentence, "Never mind" As if he had something important that he wasn't saying.

"Who is that kid?" I said, "Why is he so special to bring even Angel Corp into this?"

"You don't have to know" Max said, "But you have one more chance to make him your friend, otherwise I'll bring in Mirana"

"Oh, Mirana's coming, I better get scared and scurry off. Sure I'll be his friend, but I'm not going to wipe his butt for him if that's what you mean by being friends." 

"No, that won't be necessary" Max said, "And great, that's the attitude I'm looking for, if a situation happens to arise where you so have to wipe his bum clean, then I expect you to do it as well, with the same reverence and respect that you would accost to any other job."

I needed another cigarette to calm this stress. I lit it up and lay down on the couch like a sloth. I didn't have to do any school work because the agency gave me a book with all the answers inside. 

Then something unexpected happened. There was a knock on my door. Julia was standing at the front door with a shy smile. "Sorry, I kind of found out where you lived..."

Oh my gosh, she followed me home after school...was that normal? Or was that not normal?

"Come on in" I gave her something to drink.

"Were you lying around like a sloth?" she sniffed the air, "It smells like there was a fire in here"

"There's a fire up here" I pointed to my head, "And in here" I pointed to my lungs"

Julia grinned, "You smoke? And you still have such good skin? I'm so jealous, you have everything" 

Uhhh...what was she doing here?

Julia eventually left after an hour. I went in the shower and went to bed leaving my head blank.

I still wasn't used to the uniform. People all around were still staring at me.

"Hey" Julia said.

"Hi" I smiled and walked on.

"Colita" she said, "How did you find the math homework? Was it difficult?" 

"It was easy" I didn't see a thing, I just copied all of the answers down.

"I thought you would find it easy" Julia said, "You're so perfect with everything" This girl thought I was amazing or something, she didn't know I was just an angel pretending to be a student. That I was a pure fraud.

"I wish I could be more like you" she said.

"Stop saying that" I snapped, "Don't say that any more"

"But why?" Julia said, "It's true"

I grinned, "It's true, but don't say it"

During break time more people were staring at me. I smiled at them, but they turned back to their friends. Hmph, boring, no one was giving me any attention....except Julia. She seemed to always be around me.

"You're new here right?" A guy came over with a grin. He had a strong smell of cologne. 

"Yeah" I said. 

"Well do you want me to show you around?" I looked up to see that he wasn't looking at my face, but at my chest. I covered my breasts and glared at him. Everyone only stared at my chest. There was a person up here you know.

"Show me around...where exactly?" I said.

"You know, here and there" Then he smiled, "How about you watch me play football after school today?"

"Are you good?" I said.

He grinned, and looked around, everyone began watching, "Am I good? Are you seriously asking me that? I'm the second best football player in the school"

I guess I was supposed to be thrilled that this guy was talking to me, by the school's standards he was hot. I thought about putting a cigarette on his body and seeing it light up. 

But I was bored, "If you're the second best, who's the best?" I said.

"It's Matt" he said. "He's amazing, he's our captain."

I groaned, this guy Matt appeared in every conversation, he poked his head in everywhere. Unfortunately, my job was to befriend him.

"Okay" I gave him a weak smile, "I'll come" 

"Wait" he took my hand, I looked down to see us holding hands, then he let go, blushing. "Sorry, it's just that you don't know my name right? My name's Jason"

"Okay Jason, see you later" I said.

It felt weird to go to the football game, it was the first game I saw in my life and I was actually enjoying it. Jason wasn't lying, he was really good, he got past a few players and passed the ball. Our school was winning by a huge margin. Jason raised the spirit of the whole team, but Matt was exceptional. When he touched the ball the opposition 
couldn't even get close to it. He was so good that he went one against one with the goalkeeper. Even the goalkeeper didn't stand a chance.

I was amazed. Halfway through the game I saw three girls walk in, they sat right next to the field. The girl in the middle was Lacey, cheering Matt on. Everytime he touched the ball the girls went crazy. Then Jason got the ball and they also cheered. 

Julia came and sat beside me. "Those two boys are so popular" I said. "And they're kind of good looking"

"They're hot" Julia frowned, "Everyone wants to be with them" The girls cheered out loud again, this time the whole crowd joined in when Jason got a pass from Matt and bounced it off the sidepost and into the goal.

"Wow" It was kinda cool to see these guys like this. When they played sports they looked so free.

The girls cheered like mad every time Matt or Jason touched the ball. After the game everyone swarmed around Matt, Lacey butted in and shooed everyone out, then they got in a car together. 

Then after the game Jason came up to me shirtless, with a towel wrapped around his shoulders. 

"Hey Colita, do you need a ride home?" he said. "Thanks for coming to the game for me." The way he talked was really sweet,

Julia looked at Colita, then at me. "You know Jason?" she said.

"Yeah, he asked me to come to the game" Julia looked shocked, "He asked you?"

Jason grinned, "So do you want a ride back home or something?"

I sighed, "Sure" although I was really supposed to be meeting Matt, I guess the difference wasn't too big whether I was with Matt or Jason. Jason took my hand and led me away to his car.

"Bye Julia" I waved to her

"Colita!" Julia ran up from behind me and grabbed my other hand. "Can I come too?" She looked really desperate. I turned to Jason, "Can my friend Julia come as well?"

Jason shrugged, "Sure, but we're just going home" Julia smiled and thanked me, Jason opened the front door to his car but I chose to sit in the back beside Julia. Jason didn't talk much the whole way, I think he was kind of disappointed that Julia came along. But I thought it was better, I didn't have much to talk to him about.

When we were halfway on the road, Jason pulled over to the side. "Sorry" he said, he grabbed a shirt from one of the car pockets and pulled it over himself. "I forgot something at Matt's house"

"What did you forget?" Julia said. 

Jason grinned, "My girlfriend"

"What? You have a girlfriend?" Why did I feel disappointed to hear that?

Jason put a finger on his lips, "Yeah, but keep it quiet, I don't want the school finding out about it"

I laughed, it was so weird, Jason had a hidden girlfriend at Matt's house?

Jason turned a street and we drove through a really rich looking neighbourhood. Every house was two stories and looked like super-rich, like the kind of home that Kim Kardashian bought and sold. The houses were all huge, even the small sizes were huge. The medium sizes were sooo big, bigger than our whole agency even. When we passed by an extra extra large size house I had to double take, I saw a woman walking with poodles, it had to be Kim Kardashian. But Jason kept driving, and the woman fell further and further behind.

Seriously, Kim, you should invest in a car one day. It's worth it.

Jason stopped and pulled in to one of the houses like he had done it a thousand times before. "Wait here" he said. He got out of the car, walked up to the door and rang the doorbell. A moment later Matt appeared in the entrance, he was smiling and talking to Jason about something.

I blinked, wait, Matt was smiling? Then he came over to the car to look at something. He looked inside, and I waved awkwardly back. 

The door opened and Matt stood over us. "Why don't you come out?" he said, "Have a look around my house"

"Did Jason forget his girlfriend here?" Julia said.

"Is that what he told you?" Matt laughed and sent Julia up to see what Jason was talking about. I was surprised, I was seeing a completely different Matt right now, he was laughing and actually a pleasure to be around.

When Julia left we were alone. "What did you do with Matt?" I said.

"What do you mean?" he was still checking out parts of the car.

"I mean you're really different now, you're actually kind of sweet."

Matt looked at me, "I'm not a mean guy or anything, I don't know where you got that from"

"Uhhh...maybe from the rude way you treated me the other day?"

Matt stood up and walked over to me. I put my hand on the car, just for some support.

"I was curious about you" he said.

"Being rude to me is being curious?"

He groaned into the sky, "Argh, don't think I'm so bad, I'm actually a nice guy beyond my tough exterior."

"They call you the beast" I said, "I wonder why they call you that? It wasn't just random right...hmmm...surely not?"

"It was this one time...we were out drinking" he said.

I smiled, it was going to be a good story. A typical young-guy-getting-drunk-and-doing-something-stupid story.

Matt sat on the hood of Jason's car. "I'm a bit embarrassed to tell a girl" he said.

"What, you can't back out now!!" I pinched his arm.

He rubbed his cheek, "Ok, fine, but you can't tell anyone"

"Okay" I agreed.

"There were a few girls at this party, and they were all drunk out of their minds" Matt said.

"Okay" I nodded, so he took them home or something right? But then it was misunderstood by the others, and now they tease him for it. But that wasn't what Matt said.

"I slept with them" he said.

"What?" I stood up and faced him, "What did you do?"

"I slept with them" Matt looked up to me with a sad face, 

“How many of them were there?”

“Five”

“And you slept with the prettiest of them?”

“No” he looked even sadder, "All five of them." He put his hand on his forehead, "I can't believe it either, I was going so hard on them. I'm really ashamed of myself, and I feel so bad for it, but the guys are all proud and envious, they're calling me the beast"

He really was a beast. And he didn't sound ashamed of it at all.

"I had been holding back for ages...and it all just came out" 

"Does Lacey know about this?" I said. I wondered if she was still dating him knowing this.

Matt sighed, "She was one of the five girls" 

Oh my gosh, What was with him? What was with her? What just happened?

He continued, "She became pretty after that, like really pretty, she outshone all the other girls, and then she basically has been around me ever since, shooing off all of the other girls."

"Yeah" it wasn't hard to picture that. I didn't even need to imagine it.

There was a loud bang and Jason came out of the house, there was a girl behind him. He came in between Matt and me and introduced me to the girl. "This is Colita" he said, "One of the sexiest girls in school" the girl nodded and looked at me judgingly, her eyebrow tilted, when she approved it rose up, and when she disapproved it fell down. 

It rose up, her hand went on her hip, and she leaned against a wall looking like  a teacup. The wall was actually Jason. "You're right, she is sexy" 

I looked over them to see if Julia was around. I didn't want to leave her alone for too long. Julia was right behind them and gave me an awkward wave. But everyone kind of ignored her.

then Jason put his hand on the girl. "This is Rebecca, my sexy sister" She smiled really kindly. "It's nice to meet you, I'm glad you're going to be Jason's girlfriend." She turned to Jason, "But don't call me sexy okay? I'm your sister." She grinned, "At least not in front of everyone" 

"I don't know what he told you" I said, "But I'm not his girlfriend, I'm not anyone's girlfriend" I said, "I'm a solo roamer"

Jason and Matt laughed, "You're so funny, what's with all this weird stuff you say"

Rebecca came forward, "We're going to the movies, do you want to come along?"

I looked to Julia, she hadn't been invited. I looked back to Rebecca and shook my head. "Maybe not this time okay? But thanks for asking"

the boys climbed into the car and Rebecca got in after them, they waved for me to come along, but before getting in I looked over to Julia. they had completely forgotten about her. She was watching us as we prepared to go.

"No worries, I'm going to walk back" I said. 

"Okay" Matt said. "We're going to pick up Lacey, so that is probably better anyway" I could hear them laughing halfway down the street.

Julia set off walking first, she didn't say a word, I had to talk first.

"I never thought Matt was so nice" I said

"He's not nice" Julia said. "He's mean"

"Really, then what do you think about Jason?" Julia walked on, ignoring my question.

"How about Jason?" I said.

"He's so shallow" she said. "All boys only look at a girl's appearances and talk to the pretty girls, but Jason is the worst of them, he doesn't talk to anyone except the prettiest girls. That's why he's never talked to me." 

I fell silent, Julia sounded really really hurt. I had just had a great time with them, and right afterwards, she was criticizing everyone.

"Did you want to go to the movie?" I said, "If you did, we could call them up now, they won't mind at all"

"No" Julia said, "I don't like them anyway." We sat down on a grassy slope outside the nearby intermediate and sat down. Then Julia started asking me all sorts of questions. I think she kept asking because I kept replying to them like I didn't mind. But soon I started to get distracted, life started to creep in.

"Thank you Colita" Julia said, "For sticking with me. I know I'm a bit dull to talk to and I'm not popular like you are, but you're really a good friend. I feel really bad for keeping you back like this."

"It's okay, I didn't really want to go to see the movie with them anyway" I wouldn't have believed my own voice even if I had heard it on loudspeaker. Besides, I didn't want to admit to her that she was right. I didn't want to admit to myself that she was right.

Julia reached up and put her hairband back in place. Her hair was a creamy brown, slightly faded along the edges and tampered. Her skirt came a little past her kness, and her chest was smaller than most of the girls her age. But that wasn't what I noticed, what I noticed most of all was that there were several lines on her wrist. Cut marks.

"What are you looking at?" Julia looked at me, "Is my hair okay?" 

"Yeah" I said, "It's fine"

### Chapter Five - Colita the Human

That night Max called me up. "Colita, are you there?"

"Yeah" I said.

"Tomorrow your real challenge starts, we know that the beast is going to be attacked"

"Attacked?" I said. "How come? How do you know this? Who is possibly wanting to attack such an unpleasant guy?" I blew out a pluff of smoke into the roof. Having these cigarettes was really the pleasure of my day, I looked forward to it all day at school.

"I can't tell you that" Max said, "But you have to protect him, can you do that Colita?"

I grinned, finally I got to do something. "I was just getting bored" I said, "So you want me to use my angel powers?"

"Remember the rules" Max said, "You're not allowed to use your powers, even if it's on a mission."

"Then what am I supposed to do? How can I protect him?" I turned it around on Max "Do you know what kind of person the beast is? I will need my powers to protect myself from him"

I didn't get the agency, what was the point of sending an angel if we weren't allowed to use our powers? That was like sitting on a toilet without being allowed to pee. That was like masturbating without being able to let loose. That was like eating sushi with nothing in the middle, so it was the same as eating rice and nori.

"It's for information" Max said, "Only Angel Corp knows about it, that's why"

I still didn't understand why Angel Corp was involved in keeping a high school student alive.

This was sooo beneath me.

I got out another cigarette, then paused and put it back in the box without lighting it. I didn't need a second one, my lungs could wait.

Tomorrow was going to be a good day.

Max told me the instructions on the phone. "No matter how safe you think he is, you have to watch him, stay around him at all times, be like a bodyguard."

Max made a sound through the receiver, "I heard you've become good friends, keep it that way, stay right next to him so that nothing will happen"

I sighed, what was Max thinking, where did he get his information? It was a high school, Matt wasn't the president, he was a snotty teenage kid who was obsessed with popularity and ego and girls, why would someone try to take his life. Why would anyone even care/

"I know what you're thinking" Max said, "This is a serious job, don't take it lightly, in fact, if Mirana was free now I'd have her take over."

So this was a mission worthy of Mirana? I felt my toes tingle. Now it was getting really interesting. I was going to watch Matt all day tomorrow, I was going to be the new Mirana. Although I would change my name to Colita if it really did work.

Matt was in the same class as me in the morning, so that was fine, he was still cocky as usual, but as soon as the others were gone he came over. By others, I meant Lacey. She was sticking around Matt like he was her schoolbag. The very moment she was gone to the bathroom, I made my way over to him.

"Hey Matt" I said.

"What do you want?" I didn't want to act all fake and be nice, he was a douche so I wanted to treat him like one.

My plan had failed, I coudln't pull off a Mirana.Yup, that's what I called it, a Mirana.

"How was the movie?" I pulled out the seat to sit down. 

Matt grinned, "You can't resist me can you?" He ruffled his hair, I found it irritating that he was so cute. "That's why you keep coming over to try to talk to me."

"Don't get full of yourself" I said, "Just because someone as attractive as me is talking to you. I just wanted to ask about some homework."

Matt couldn't stop laughing, "Colita, you're such a shy person, just admit that you're into me"

I blushed, this stupid mission, Max, making me do such humiliating things. "I hate you" I said.

"Then why are you here?" Matt pulled out my chair, moving me back. He looked me up and down, then couldn't stop looking at my chest. I turned away from him. I really didn't have an excuse.

"I'm just looking for some homework help" I said.

Matt burst out laughing, I wouldn't have believed myself either, it was such a lame excuse. But Matt was laughing so hard that it made me kind of happy. I hadn't seen him laughing before, only making small dirty jokes with his friends, around Lacey he was always serious.

"What are you doing here?" Lacey was glaring at me with her hands on her hips. "That's my seat"

Matt pulled out the chair on the other side of him, "Come sit here Lacey"

Lacey didn't pull her eyes away from me. "No, I was sitting in that seat" she pointed where I was.

Matt sighed, "Come on Lacey, don't be like that, it's just a seat"

I stared back at Lacey, I wasn't going to just back off she was so heartless, all I was doing was talking to Matt.

"Don't even talk to him" she pointed at me, then went to the seat Matt pulled out. "Don't you dare even talk to my Matt"

Matt grinned, "I've got two girls in love with me" he tried to wrap his arms around us, but we both pulled away.

Lacey pointed at me with a long manicured fingernail, "She doesn't love you like I do" she said, "She's just a gold digger"

I'd had enough of this, it wasn't even worth arguing with her, she was a toxic being, reeking of perfume and jealousy. I stood up, slamming my chair against the wall. "Don't worry, I'll go"

I would just watch Matt from afar then.

I didn't see Julia that day, she didn't come to school, she was doing something else.

For the rest of the day Lacey stayed right beside Matt. She didn't go to the bathroom either. She glanced at me every now and then to see where I was, and if I was watching Matt.

I sighed, maybe the beast wasn't Matt, but Lacey, she was out of control, I mean I knew girl's are crazy, but her craziness level was off the charts. I couldn't even talk to Matt.

During lunchtime I sat alone, because Julia was away. But soon a familiar person came to join me.

"Can I sit here?" Jason held his hand over the chair next to me.

I looked around, "Sure, but aren't you going to sit at your table?" I looked over to see the table of jocks all staring at us.

"I could" Jason smiled, "But I would rather sit here with you, is that okay?"

I blushed, he was waiting for my permission. "Go ahead Jason"

He sat down and started cutting up the sausages and eating them. I noticed that people from the other tables were looking at us again. Jason was sitting at a table with only me. This could only mean one thing.

I wondered if he liked me, or if this was just friendship.  Or was hej just acting nice because he thought I was weeeeiiirirrrddddd????? Spelt like that.

"You eat that much?" Jason pointed to my plate. I nodded because I was in between mouthfuls, I started chewing profusely to be able to start talking again. But Jason started laughing,

"What?" I finally said after I swallowed down what was in my mouth.

"You're so funny when you chew like that, it's so un-girly" His eyebrows floated up, "I don't mean that in a bad way, it's actually kind of cute"

I was too old to be cute. But I smiled anyway. "Aren't you worried that sitting with me here will ruin your popularity? Everyone's watching us, I might make you become a loser as well" 

Jason put his fork down and looked into my eyes, "Colita, you're not a loser, that's why I'm here"

Great, was he in love with me? That was something only someone in love could say.

(Somethign substantial to bond them together)

"Can I sit down?" Nathan came to our table

"No" Jason said, before I could reply with something kind

"You two look like you need some company" Nathan took the chair opposite me and sat down, putting his tray in front of mine. "May I?"

"No" Jason pulled the chair in.

Nathan grinned, "You're so possessive, she's not yours" He pulled out another chair and sat down.

“Yet” Jason said.

“What?” I looked at him.


“And what part of no means yes?" Jason crossed his arms, we was obviously getting frustrated.

"He's already sitting" I said, "May as well let him"

"That's kind, Colita" Nathan leaned in, "So what were you guys talking about just now? Was it about Colita's crush on me?" He looked at me, “I like you, too bad your friend is a bit prettier than you are”

“What?”

“It's just negging” he said, “Relaaaaaxxxxx already. What were you talking about? Tell me tell me.”

Jason looked embarrassed, an expression he hardly ever been held on his face. "Nothing that you should care about" He looked handsome when he was trying.

Nathan looked at me, "Colita, can I ask you a question?" He went on before I could say no, or anything "Do you like Jason?"

"Woah Nathan" Jason turned to me, "You don't need to answer that Colita"

It wasn't a difficult question for me, I was going to say the truth that I wasn't interested, but then I saw Jason looking back at me hopefully and suddenly my mouth fastened tight.

"He's fun to be with" I said. "And cute"

"Cute? what does that mean?" Nathan said.

"It's none of your business" Jason said, he suddenly looked relaxed, "It sounds good"

"It means I like Jason more than I like you" I said.

Nathan looked away, "Gee, that's harsh, all you girls look at are a guy's looks, you don't care what's inside them."

"You're right, I'm not attracted to what I see outside you, and I'm also not attracted to what I see inside you" I told Nathan, "I see an arrogant inconsiderate guy who asks weird and awkward questions to manipulate my and Jason's social standing."

Nathan laughed, "I don't know what you just said...but you know me too well"

Amidst the conversation, I glanced over to the popular table to see if Matt was still there. I had to watch over him, that was my main priority, I couldn't forget that. 

He was looking at me when I glanced over, then he quickly tore his gaze from me and looked around. 

Wow, I didn't need to worry, he was staring at me just as much as I was trying to watch him...What was with all these guys giving me this attention?

Jason and Nathan started talking about football. I realized that it was what they both had in common. Nathan told us how he used to play, but once he moved to this school he stopped because the football team was full. 

"Colita" Jason said, "You want to come and watch my next game as well?"

I nodded, "Yeah, that would be nice" I had to admit, I enjoyed watching the guys play football last time, especially Jason, because he was so good at it, I enjoyed cheering him on. He was also a really kind guy, and considerate too. I knew that if I said no, he wouldn't be forceful, or become dejected. Maybe, just maybe I could be myself around him.

"When is your next game?" I said. I wanted to see him running, those legs slicing the ball into the back of the net.

Ooo....those legs!! I was cuddling myself just imagining it.

"What did you do? There's an aura of cuteness around her, do you see" Nathan pointed at me. Jason looked at me as well and nodded. "You're right, she's out of control"

"Hehehehe" I sniggered to myself and pulled out a Snicker's bar to munch on.

"So..." Nathan said, "Since I quit football and all, how about you and I go to the movies together?" he said.

"How does that relate?" I was confused, was this his lame excuse to try and go out with me? Did it matter if he had quit football or not?

"I mean, I don't play football right now, so I have the time, so we can do something together." He stopped, "Am I not making any sense to you?"

I shook my head, "No, are you making sense to yourself?"

Nathan took my hand on the table. I felt Jason staring at him. "I'm trying to ask you to go out with me Colita"

"You can't do that" I said.

"Why" he said.

I burst out laughing, this was so hilarious, both these guys were trying to ask me out. I was so much older than them, and an angel.

"What's so funny?" Jason said.

"You guys have so many girls to choose from, why go for me?"

"All those girls are boring" Nathan said, "You're the best"

"I'll take you to an expensive meal" Jason said. "Everyone will look at us"

"I'm not a vain girl" I said, "I don't care about what people think of me"

"That's why you're so cool!" Nathan said.

"No" I said.

"Why not, aren't you interested? Am I not hot enough?" Nathan said.

"You just can't" I stood up to leave. There was just too much difference between us. I knew too much that they didn't know.

Nathan stood up with me, and so did Jason. I wondered what the others thought of us, three of us standing up at once like we were in some kind of performance.

"Let me take your tray" Nathan reached out, but before he got it, Jason took it. 

"I'll do this" he stacked my tray on his own and walked off.

Nathan snarled, "That's so unfair, how about mine? Do you want to take it as well?"

Jason turned his head back, "No"

I couldn't stop laughing, these two were sooo funny, like they were being kind, but also competitive at the same time. High school boys were fun to be around.

Jason and Nathan both looked at me. "What's she laughing about?" Jason said

"Beats me, I thought you would know"

"No idea" Jason put the trays down before he was joined by a flock of the jocks.

"What were you doing with the new girl?" One of the guys asked. I noticed that he was also on the football team. They were talking where I could hear them.

"We were just talking" Jason said. "Colita is different to other girls, she's a lot more mature"

I grinned, he had that right. I was standing behind a wall listening to them, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but as I was putting my tray away I heard them talking.

"She's a bit weird" One of the girl's said, "She only hangs around Matt and Julia"

"But she's hot" a guy said.

"She's hot, and a little weird" Jason said, "But I think she's amazing, and really considerate of others, and has very strong morals. She will never cheat on someone"

I put my hand on my mouth...oh my gosh, was he talking about me? I felt really weird, no one had ever said something like that about me. Jason was so...unbelievable. From the way he said it I knew he had thought about it a lot.

"Are you in love with her?" A girl said. "You've never talked of anyone so fondly like that, it sounds like you really really like her."

Jason didn't respond, at least I didn't hear anything. But I heard laughing, "Jason's embarrassed, he's never fallen for a girl before, it's always the girl's falling for him"

Wow, what had I gotten myself into. I quickly hurried off before they said any more.

Then a bit further down the corridor I saw Nathan, he was talking to a girl I didn't recognize, she was standing in front of him looking up. He had his hand on the wall and leaning with his neck.

I heard what she said, "Nathan, since we were in primary school together...and now, I like you, will you go out with me."

This girl was really cute, I wanted to hear what Nathan would say in accepting her.

"Sorry" Nathan leaned forward, he put her hands in his. She looked so frail and vulnerable, every word he said made her tremble in nervousness. It must have been so difficult for him to approach him like this. 

"I'm sorry" Nathan said, "There's a girl that I already like" He didn't say it in a way that was condescending or mean, but really really considerate. I put my hand on my mouth again. I couldn't believe he was rejecting this cute girl, this other girl that he liked must have been really amazing.

But even more than that, this girl was probably rejected in the kindest, most responsible way ever in the history of rejections.

As if on cue, Nathan looked down the corridor and straight at me. He looked a bit surprised to see me there, and I stared back like a deer caught in headlights.

I turned and ran, I shouldn't have been listening to those private conversations, it was none of my business what those boys did. I went outside to get some fresh air, and bumped into something hard and solid.

I fell on the ground in a heap. "Owwwww, Ouch, ouch ouch"

I looked up to see what I had bumped in to. Matt was staring down at me.

"What are you doing here?" I said. "I just bumped into something, do you know what it was?"

Matt rubbed his belly, "You bumped into my solid abs" he said.

I blushed, he was right about that, they sure were muscular. 

Matt was sitting still. I looked around to the right and left, score! there was no Lacey in sight, my Lacey GPS pointed to her absence. Matt was alone, this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him.

I realized that I was actually happy to see Matt, not because I was supposed to be following him for my mission, not because he was rich and good looking, but because he was actually kind of fun to be around. There was so much I wanted to ask him. Why was the agency after him? How he and Lacey got together. But I asked him something else, about myself.

"Jason is your friend right?" I said. "your best friend"

"Yeah" Matt tucked his knees against his chest. "He is" He turned to me, "Do you like him?"

"No..." I shook my head, "I wanted to get some advice from a boy, I think he likes me. And not just Jason, but Nathan too"

"You're popular" Matt said. "That's not strange"

"Do you have any advice?" I said.

Matt smiled, "Which of them do you like more?" He turned to face me, with one palm on the floor, he wiped a hair out of my eye. he was touching me...Matt, the beast, was touching me. right now he was nothing like a beast, he was as tame as a sparrow.

"I don't understand what guys are thinking" I said, "Why would they like someone like me?" I looked up to see Matt, he had forgotten to listen and was staring at my chest again. I sighed, seriously...apart from this, what did boys think about. I reached out to touch Matt's chin and moved his head up to face my eyes, not my breasts.

"Sorry" Matt's cheeks turned red, "I keep on doing that whenever I see you, you're just so hot"

"You should stop" I said, "Girls find it disgusting"

"Go on" Matt said. "What were you saying" He wiped his forehead and turned to face me. I could tell he was trying not to look elsewhere, but at my eyes and I appreciated it.

"I feel like these guys have really bad taste, I don't know what they're thinking, why do they like me? I'm just another girl here"

"You're friggen hot" Matt said. "But that's not all, you also have a great personality and aren't all whiny and needy like so many of these other girls"

That was because I was so much older...

"Oh my Goodness!" I heard a shout, then running down the stairs was of course, Lacey. She had her hands in the air, and was pointing at me. "What are you doing with Matt? The moment I go away, you steal him"

I stood up and looked at Matt, I guess this was the end of our conversation. He also stood up and dusted his pants off. "I need to go back to practice." he said.

Lacey led him off, but he looked back at me once before entering the field. I knew because I was looking back at him.

For the first time in my life, I kind of wanted to be Lacey.

For the rest of the day I had Matt somewhere in my vision. I couldn't imagine that his life would be in danger, we were in a school, things like that didn't happen. After school, I went to watch the boys practice, Jason waved to me, and Matt did his usual I-don't-see-Colita-when-Lacey-is-near-me act..which was totally cool.

When the soccer game finished, Matt scored about ten goals, most of them were singlehandedly dribbling through the rest of the team, including Jason. And then I thought about him more. I was so curious about him. Who was he? Was he kind? What was he thinking about all the time?

Jason waved to me whenever he looked up and I waved back. When the game finished he came over in the soccer uniform with a towel wrapped around his neck again. "Do you need a ride home?" he said. All the soccer team was walking out this way, past me.

I wanted to say yes, but I had to watch over Matt today.

"No thanks" I said, "Not today, but some other day, okay?"

"That's cool" Jason headed out. He was probably muddled whether I liked him or not. I felt bad to make him feel that way, but suddenly I didn't have the courage to reject him. After talking to Matt, I felt that they were really cool to have around, even if I didn't like them. 

The rest of the team walked past, it was only Matt and Lacey left. I didn't know where Lacey was, but she was bound to appear soon.

I looked down at my necklace, it sparkled back in the same way it always did. I guess I was becoming more of a high school student, with the way I was thinking.

I looked up to see Matt. He was smiling, "I didn't know you were into jewelery."

"I'm not" I quickly put it away. 

"Okay, well I'll see you tomorrow" he waved goodbye. I looked around, my detection meter said that Lacey was not nearby. But Matt still walked off.

He never offered me a ride home.

I sighed, what was I expecting, another guy to like me? Two was enough, how greedy was I getting?

I picked up my bag to walk home. But after three steps saw Matt in front of me. he was standing next to his car, organizing his soccer gear.

"Sorry Colita" he said, "I can't give you a ride home, Lacey told me not to"

"That's okay" I felt a big relief that he was talking to me, he hadn't forgotten about me. Then I hit myself, what was I doing? I was supposed to just be protecting Matt, not him protecting me. I'm thirty two year old woman for goodness sakes!

Maybe thirty three by now.

"Lacey's coming over tonight" he said, "So I have to go home straight away"

"It's alright" I said, "You don't have to say sorry over something like this"

Matt looked at me for a bit longer. "Yeah, actually maybe I can take you just part way home?

I shook my head, "You should go back to Lacey quickly, she'll be waiting" It wasn't fair on her either.

"Well I'll see you tomorrow I guess" Matt said. 

I waved goodbye. Now I was alone at school with my bag in my hands. I began the long walk home.

As I walked home I thought of Matt. What if I had gone in his car? What would we be talking about? I shrugged, he would probably be looking at my chest anyway. He was a big pervert.

A huge pervert.

Then I remembered what Max said. I had to follow Matt everywhere, even out of school.

I groaned...it meant that I had to go to his house and watch him at least until midnight. That made me no different from a creepy stalker, watching my man until late at night.

The biggest pervert.

Matt didn't need protection, I agreed with Max that a lot of people in the world did, but if there was one person in the world who didn't need protection, it was Matt, if anything it was the other way around, he protected those around him.

I arrived at Matt's house in the dark. I didn't know what I was supposed to do if he was indoors. I held my breath in nervousness...wait, why was I holding my breath? I was completely supposed to be here, everything was legitimate, this was my job.

That just made me feel weirder.

I stood in front of Matt's door with my hair over my face, just in case he recognized me. I raised my hand, I could knock and ask him for some guidance for my homework. 

But then I heard some laughter, it came from behind the house. I immediately crouched down and turned around and slided out of view. 

What was I doing, I was acting like I was five, hiding and seeking.

Matt's house was so huge, it was a hike to get to the back. But there was definitely laughter, giggling. I sneaked past a fence, by sneak...I mean I climbed over it and scraped my knee. Then it opened up and I saw a big pool, the house was in the back sitting on a bench behind the pool was Matt. and in his arms was the gorgeous lovely darling sweetheart Lacey.

Ugh, that girl again. Why did I even bother being surprised?

Lacey was laughing about something that Matt said, then she leaned over and grabbed his cheek and pinched it. "You're so cute" she said. Matt responded by grabbing her arms and kissing her neck.

They must have been here for a while already, they were really close and it felt weird for me to be watching this, I shoudln't be here.

He kissed her neck, but she yelped and pulled him away. "Stop" she looked around, "We're out in the open"

Matt came away and looked at Lacey, he was so handsome. I wanted him to stop looking at Lacey. Then I hit myself, why was I attracted to Matt? He was an immature high school brat.
Lacey looked into the bushes towards me. "I just heard something, it sounded like someone hit them self." 

"Don't mind it" Matt leaned in again, he kissed Lacey's neck and moved up, to her jaw, her ear, then rested on her lips. This time Lacey responded, she held his head and opened her mouth, then they started kissing furiously, eating each other's tongues, and drinking each other's saliva. Matt was covering Lacey's face with his saliva, and she was doing the same to him.

I checked my watch, it was 11:30...I wanted to leave, I shouldn't be here, this was just nasty and none of my business, they needed privacy. If I left now, thirty minutes early, it would be fine right?

They didn't stop kissing, in fact it got worse, Matt reached over and peeled Lacey's shirt up, moving his hand higher and higher until I saw the bottom of Lacey's bra.

Lacey didn't falter, it was like she was used to it. "You're such a... breast's... man" she made out between gasps for air. Matt just moaned and started grasping her, kneading her like a lump of dough.

Then Lacey started, she reached over and pulled Matt's shirt up, it came off liek an apple peel, and beneath it was a masterpiece. I had never seen a more muscular body in my thirty two years. His abs looked back at me like "Hellllooo!!!!!"

It drove me crazy, but I had to watch it. I lay down, cracking branch, but they were too focused to hear me. I wanted to touch Matt's abs, run my hand all over his body, do what Lacey was doing.

Then Matt groaned, Lacey was in complete control over him. For the first time in my life, and I couldn't believe I was saying this...I wanted to be Lacey, I wanted to show him what I could do for him.

I reached down to my skirt, it slipped off easily. I was ashamed, they were half my age, and I was still watching when I knew I shouldn't be. It was just too much to ask me to control myself. 

Twelve o clock came, I rolled over and put my skirt back on, I stood up and evened my clothing out to make it look like nothing happened. And then stepped out of the brushes and started walking home. Matt and Lacey were still kissing, they were both still hungry, his passion had only grown, and hers was responding. Mine was exhausted.

I felt so ashamed, what had I done? What if they found out I was watching, no embarrassment could save me.

I walked as quietly as I could, away from here. Feelings of frustration were welling up. Max told me to stay there, it was kind of his fault that made me watch them, Max messed me up, I didn't want to be there, and now I had stooped to a low level.

I heard a sound. My heart started beating hard...who was that? Had they seen me?

"Colita" it was a voice I knew. "What are you doing here?"

Oh no, they even knew my name, this was bad...really bad. "What are you doing here?" I wondered if they had seen anything., they could have just arrived.

"I always come through here" It was Jason, he came forward with a smile. "I'm sorry" he covered his mouth, "I didn't mean to see anything, I was just going to Matt's house from the back." He was wearing casual clothes, shorts and a t-shirt. He stopped in front of me and tried to smile again, but it disappeared when I didn't respond.

I had never been this embarrassed before, Jason was just about the only guy I liked in school, he was the friendliest and nicest, I even thought of doing more with him. Now he had seen me at my basest.

"What are you talking about?" I tried to fake it like nothing happened. If he believed it when I was faking, it was no big deal. 

"You were..." His eyes dropped to my skirt, it was probably an unconscious reaction, but it made me feel like dirt.

"I was what?" He wasn't supposed to say it, why couldn't he just walk away? Why did he have to confront me about this, didn't he understand how I felt?

"You were...touching yourself" he said. He fell silent, and I stood sideways from him. Then we could hear Lacey moaning about something through the trees.

"No I wasn't" I lied, it was none of his business anyway.

Jason laughed, "You were so, I saw it, the Colita at school would never do that, I never knew you were such a pervert."

"I'm not a pervert, you are. I didn't do anything."

Jason came over, he frowned, "You don't have to get all rude with me, just because you're embarrassed I caught you at a bad moment"

"I'm not embarrassed, I didn't do anything, why can't you just back off?" He reached out to touch my cheek and I instinctively pushed him away. My palms had hit his chest, and he fell to the ground.

"Sorry Jason" I said "Jason, sorry, I didn't mean to..."

He lay there, still for a while, then looked up. "Why are you like that?" he said, "You're the one who's not supposed to be here, what will Matt do if he finds out?" he stood up and wiped the dirt off his clothes, "He'll think you're some slut" 

That was it I was out of here, I didn't care anymore about some stupid job. But before I could leave Jason grabbed my hand. "Wait" he said.

I stopped mid track. He was annoying and blunt, but I wanted him to comfort me, didn't he know I felt bad? I felt guilty for watching my classmates. If he gave me some warmth, then it would be so much better. I turned my head and looked at him, wondering what he was going to do. Jason took my head and moved it to his lips.

"I have proof" he said.

Was he going to kiss me, my hand? Any part of me was okay right now.

His lips moved closer, my hand tingled with the feel of his breath. But I never felt the kiss, he moved my hand to his nose and took a big waff. He looked up, "I knew it, your hand smells disgusting, you were definitely touching yourself"

"Get lost" I ripped my hand away "Just go away, go away go away!!!" I could hardly speak properly. I stomped off far away from him. I had enough of him, he was so insensitive, the biggest jerk in the school. How was he popular, he was just annoying and rude and mean.

Jason called after me "Colita, come back" I didn't turn back, I didn't even slow down.

I never wanted to see him again. Screw Jason

### Chapter Six - Jason the chatterbox

_SORRY guys I lost the plot a bit here, the chapter just keeps going on and on..._

"I hate Jason", I repeated that to myself on the way home until it started to lose its strength, and then I made up something else, "I wish Jason didn't see anything." After about five people stared at me I realized I needed someone to talk to.

I took out my phone and called Julia, but there was no answer. I texted her to reply to me as soon as she could. What was she doing, she didn't come to school so now I had no one to talk to.

My embarrassment turned to worry. What if Jason told Matt? Matt would think I was a disgusting lowly creature no better than a caterpillar. Then Lacey and everyone else would find out, and I would be shunned.

I sighed, how was I going to go to school now. Should I just stay home tomorrow.

The phone rang, I threw my cigarette butt out the window, picked up the receiver and breathed out 'Hello?'

"Good job, you protected Matt"

"What do you mean? No one attacked him so I didn't do anything. Why did you make me watch over him?"

"It was a very high probability that he was going to be atatcked" Max said. "We're very fortunate that nothing happened" 

"Why won't you tell me what is happening, do you know how much effort I went to do it properly when I could have just been sitting at home"

"Are you upset Colita?" Max said, "You sound like you are"

"I'm not upset, why do you have to blame me for everything?"

"I'm not blaming you, you just sound like you've had a bad day."

I took a deep breath, it wasn't Max's fault, I shouldn't be taking it out on him. "Sorry, I'm just a bit tired, that's all"

"Well try and take it easy" he said

I considered telling him what I did. But it was Max, he would just laugh at me, he had more important things to deal with.

"Okay well then I'll tell you" Max said, "I've been feeling bad about not telling you, but it was company policy."

Oh so finally he could tell me.

"You can't tell anyone, this is top secret" he said.

I nodded, then realizing that he couldn't hear it, I smiled. Look at who was gaining some trust in the company...me! "What is it Max?"

"Matt is the boss's big son. And he had a death threat thrown against him recently"

"What?" Except I didn't sound like that, I sounded something more like a missile going off. "Matt's your son?"


"No, not mine, well I am your boss, but I mean the big boss, the biggest boss in the company"

"And just who is that?" my eyes narrowed, I had never met anyone in the company higher than Max. 

"He's the boss angel, let's just call him that, and if Matt goes, so does the company."

"That's okay" I said, then I held my mouth, "Oops, I didn't mean to say that out loud"

"No Colita it's not, it means you will lose your job as well"

"That's not okay" I couldn't lose my job.

"So it was good that Matt was fine." Max sighed, "Look, you have tot ake this seriously, I don't know what's happening at the school or whatever, but your priority is to protect Matt, stay by him, everything else is secondary.

I nodded, that meant Jason, Julia, Lacey, everyone else I met was not as important.

"How about me?" I said

"You?" Max paused, "What do you mean?"

"Am I important?"

Max sighed, "You're thirty three, do you still need me to give you confirmation like you're some teenager?"

"I'm thirty three, and a woman. I do" I sighed with him "You're right, I shouldn't, but I do"

"Fine" he made a third and final super sigh, "I gave you this mission Colita, it might be because you're clumsy, and you're outright clueless about the job at times, but you're also a kind and caring person who really knows what people need. I thought you might be the most suitable, and it turns out you are. You've fit in with everyone great."

I could cry, this was the closest that Max got to giving out compliments, he never gave them out on silver platters. When they came, it was almost always accompanied with a string of insults, but that only made the juice in the middle all the sweeter.

"It isn't physical protection that Matt needs, although he does need that as well" he said. "Most of all what he needs is emotional protection"

"What?!!" That came out of nowhere.

"I gave you this mission because I thought a kind woman like yourself could be like a mother figure to him, help him figure himself out" Max swallowed so loud that I could hear it. Was he nervous on the other end? Max only swallowed that hard when he was eating steak. I was pretty sure he wasn't eating any.

"Matt never had a good childhood, in fact he only grew up with his father, our boss. His mother was away, and his father was always focused on the company. Think of Matt like your child, treat him as you would with unconditional love."

Okay...so the mission was already difficult, but now it just stepped up a few notches. Treat him like a child? He was the hardiest skinned male I had met, he treated me like a child. 

"That means to show him that you care" Max said.

I groaned, Matt treated me bad without me showing him care. "Why does it come down to angels to show humans care?" It was just going to be humiliating, he would make me sink as low as possible.

"It may not seem obvious to you yet, but Matt is psychologically damaged." There was a pause as Max adjusted the receiver, "Colita? Did you hear me?"

When I deliberately didn't reply, Max became embarrassed, "You should say something, don't leave me hanging."

"I don't understand why I need to protect Matt, but I'll do it because you told me to, and it's an order for me to keep my job. But don't think that I'm doing it because I want to." I believed that if I did something seriously enough, with a lot of intention, then maybe others would see it and change. Even Mirana, her hardworking attitude and pure intent really made me want to change myself, I wanted to be that kind of person who inspired others and changed things around them.

But when it came down to it, I was the one who always sat on the couch at home smoking to my hearts content, too lazy and grumpy and snotty to do anything valuable. 

I wanted to change myself, myself. It all started with me.

I dropped the cigarette butt on the carpet and smudged it out in disgust. That should be the last one for today.

I prayed that Jason wouldn't tell Matt that he saw me, if he did, then surely Matt wouldn't want to come close to me. When I saw Jason at morning break he smiled and waved as if nothing happened, I smiled and waved back. It was easier to just act like we were best friends. I didn't want anyone to find out so I had to get closer to Jason before he bragged about it to everyone the way boys always do. 

Matt didn't act any different from usual, he was the same cocky guy he used to be. I breathed a sigh of relief. He didn't know, which meant that Jason hadn't told him.

During lunchtime, while I was snacking on a huge sandwich full of cheese and ham and other diet-unfriendly stuff, Jason pulled me over.

"Colita, how are you doing today?"

"I'm fine" I crossed my arms and looked up at him. "Why do you ask Jason Mervich?"

He looked around to make sure no one was watching, which was never the case since he was so popular, everyone withint a five foot radius was watching. He went on anyway, smirking like a king. "I never knew you were such a pervert"

"Whaaaat are you talking about? I'm not" I looked around in embarrassment, Why did he have to go into it again, what was the point of repeating everything all over? What if somebody heard him

This time Jason really looked around, I realized he was actually trying to make sure that no one was watching. He was everyone watching and grabbed my hand to lead me away.

Everyone saw Jason Mervich pulling the new girl, Colita into to the narrow corridor which was only frequented by couples.

"What are you doing?" I pulled my hand away from his grasp. 

"I need to talk to you" He took my hand again and led me further down the corridor. "It's about Matt"

I rolled my eyes. Of course, everything everyone said had to be about Matt. Matt this and Matt that, as soon as you stepped close to him you had to be talked about. Jason put his finger on my lips and led me silently, "Stop talking Colita someone might hear you" 

Well, he was the one dragging me here... we didn't have to be here in the first place.

But with my arm was pulled by him it kinda felt nice to have someone in control "Jason" I called out, but he didn't respond. 

"Jason, stop, it's enough"

He suddenly turned around to face me, like an animal that had long been lying in wait. "Colita, I thought you would be more embarrassed, you're acting like I didn't see you or anything."

"I am embarrassed" I blurted out, clenching the air with my fists, "That's why I don't want to talk about it, that's why I don't want to be dragged here by you to talk about it."

Jason looked upset, finally. I was dying to see his weakness, he was always so strong, and strong "I need to ask you a question" He put his hand over his forehead and looked back at me, like he had been thinking about this for a long time. "Do you like Matt?" he said, "I know you find him hot, that's why you were touching yourself"

I looked away, "No, I don't like him in that way. When he was kissing Lacey, it was just...attractive" We both blushed and looked away, it was an awkward topic. 

Jason put his hand against the wall, over my head and leaned in, trying to steal everything I had. "Don't think I haven't noticed, you're always looking at him, and you're following him around."

I looked down, so he had caught me...he was quite observant.

"Colita" He came even closer, "You can tell me, I feel like you're hiding something, but you can trust me" He crossed his hand over his chest, "I won't tell a soul, I promise. It's not good for you to be keeping it to yourself."

I wanted to tell him what this was about, that is was my job, that I had to follow him, and it wasn't out of choice. I really did, I looked into his hopeful eyes which stared down at me in understanding.

"Do you always touch yourself when you see others kissing?" he said. The way he said it and looked at me was so proud, like he was laughing in my face for being weak. I couldn't possibly admit. But I wanted to, I needed him to know the truth.

"Yes" I said, "Every time some people make out around me I'm so turned on that my fingers just start roaming around down there, I can't help it, it's just a really excited part of me""

Jason swallowed, his eyes stared at mine with deep intensity. He came closer and closer until his face was just inches from mine.

"Do you want to make out?" he said. "Then you can get excited and not feel guilty"

"No" I said.

"Really?" He didn't smile, he kept staring relentlessly, locked on me.

Then, instead of waiting for an answer, he gave me one. Jason Mervich, in the school hall, on the 27th of June, on a winter's day that was particularly warm so that she decided she didn't need to wear her thicker socks laced with cotton, she stood back as he leaned in and brushed his lips against hers.

Mine.

Hers.

Argh, it was driving me absolutely crazy, this was the first time I had been kissed by a guy so hot to this calibre. As soon as I felt his lips, a fire lighted up somewhere inside me, I didn't know about anything else, right now I needed more. I took my hands off the wall and wrapped them around his neck. I grabbed his hair and pulled him closer, trying to feel every sensation he gave me.

Jason and I, we made out like this was the first life we touched in a long long time, tongues and lips were intertwining like two serpents on their way to a feast.

Sometimes I wonder what we must have looked like; maybe we were two fiery teenagers obsessed in the moment, living it to its utmost and letting every other thought slide past us in ignorance. Maybe we were like two ants pulling a quick coitus and continuing our generation for posterity. Or maybe we were missing in the world.

Jason moved his hands down my neck, his hands brushed over my breast and rubbed over my clothing, trying to get closer.

I considered it going further, just for a moment. It felt so good, and I hadn't done anything like this in a long time. From the way Jason was touching me, I could tell he was used to touching girls. I took his hand and put it back on my lips, he poked at my lip for a second with his finger.

"Why not Colita?" he said.

"You can only have this" I pointed to my lips and and let him do as he pleased. He bit around, the top and bottom, and then gave a groan. "But I want more"

Guys at this age, couldn't control themselves. SIGH

I licked my lips, "You can do anything you want with these, but you're not touching me anywhere else." It was my body, he had to listen to me.

"That's alright" Jason said, then he started kissing me again. He made out a sentence in between sentences, whenever he came up for breath, "I know...next...time you....will...let me....love you"

A moment was all it lasted. The school bell rang, and Jason let go of me like an internal alarm had gone off. 

He held my shoulders and looked at me before he left. "Colita" he said, "I really really like you, when I go home I can't stop thinking about you, I always find myself wanting to be closer to you and talk to you to get to know you better. So when you're around Matt it hurts, I know he's my best friend and all, but...still..." he looked at me, there wasn't a trace of a grin, he was completely serious, "I want you all for myself, I don't want you to go near him." Jason swallowed, "I know he's my best friend, so I shouldn't be saying this but Matt's a predator, he will take anything that he is interested in. And girl's can't resist him, I'm just an entree compared to him."

And who said I was yours? That's what I felt like saying, but instead I didn't say anything and all sorts of feelings started to well up in me, swirling around like a chopstick being stirred in miso soup.

Oh no, did I make him fall for me, I just got the love talk, there were two feelings inside me. One was a disappointment, I had never meant for any of this, but there was also pride, no boy had every given me this much thought, to Jason I was a special girl who was different to all others. I was proud at being able to make him feel this way. Besides, he was hot. I enjoyed kissing him, even if it was just for fun. I was doing him a service, letting him enjoy his life more.

I sighed, yeah Colita, keep telling yourself that. Maybe one day you will believe it.

"We better go to class" If anyone saw us here it would be all over the school in an instant. And that wouldn't be good for my relationship with Matt.

Jason kept his hand over my head, he took his other hand and brushed some hair away from my face. He was staring at me intently, admiring every feature I had.

I reminded myself that these weren't my features, they were features that I borrowed from high school girls, this wasn't me, I was a thirty two year old woman, he shouldn't be looking at me like that.

But Jason didn't stop. He didn't know that. "Colita, you're torturing me" he closed his eyes and after a long while opened them to see me in front of him. "I go home and look through my contacts, girls, but all I can think about is you. I think about wanting to get to know you better, where you're from, what you like and don't like, if you've had a boyfriend, and what kind of sports you play." He sighed, "When i go home I just imagine talking to you, asking you all sorts of questions, you crying in my lap, us watching a movie and laughing together and all sorts of things. I mean no offence but I want to stop thinking about you, but I just can't, you're stuck there deep in me."

By all sorts of things...he meant boy things.

By boy things he meant man things.

By man things he meant things that couldn't be written.

"Then at night, I jog around and wish I coudl meet you, I stand outside your place, wishing you would notice me."

"You already gave me that talk" I said. I needed to get this straight with him, I was just having some fun, he was taking it way too seriously. "I'm not in love with you, don't be so full of yourself, I can do what I want, you can't control me"

Jason grinned, "You're hot when you talk like that, just now you were begging me for more, you were kissing me so hard" I just touched you and you were out of control, like "Hold me back". "Colita you're like a beast awakened, I wish you'd just be mine, I'll treat you well"

"No" I said, "I'm not interested, just go away from me" I walked away, any longer here and people would really start talking. It was hard, if I got closer to Jason it meant that Matt would become further, but if I became closer to Matt, I wouldn't get Jason's company. Matt was annoying to be around, but it was my job.

Jason called out "Where are you going? Class? We can skip class"

"Don't you have a girlfriend?" I said, "Shouldn't you be running to her? Won't she think it's strange if both of us are skipping class together?"

Jason shook his head, "I don't have a girlfriend, besides, you were kissing me back just now, it's too late for you to be playing the good girl act."

Jason said he stood outside my house. It was obsessive what he was saying, but it wasn't creepy, it was kind of cute. And besides, he really was a really good kisser, and he was sort of considerate, in a weird way. 

"Okay" I nodded, "You're right" I wiped a bit of hair out of my face. "Come here"

Jason looked back at me, not sure whether he should be excited or dejected. "What?" He stepped forward slowly.

When he was within reach I grabbed him. He looked surprised as I sealed his lips with mine. In a fraction of a moment he opened his mouth wide and started to engorge himself in my saliva and taste.

Then I pulled back and wiped my lips with the back of my hand. I could still taste his saliva and felt its stickiness sliding down my hand "How was I?" I said, "It's a bit of my feeling"

Jason grinned, "Wow, you're amazing Colita, it's like you're really experienced at this or something, like you're really used to it."

I could have taken it as an insult saying I was easy, but instead I just shrugged, "Yeah, I guess I've practiced" Jason was like a Teddy bear I loved, it wasn't serious enough to get upset about.

Later in class, instead of listening to the teacher I sat looking outside with my head in my arms. Why did I kiss Jason, why did I give him so much attention? I had never been so spontaneous and excited by a guy.

Then I remembered what he said, about him saying that he always thought about me, and that he wanted to know all about me. It was kind of sweet, high school boys, seriously. They got into every small detail like their life depended on it. It was only a kiss right?

Even so, Jason said things about me that even I didn't realize were true. Did he understand me that well?

The teacher called out the roll. I answered blatantly. 

"Julia Richmond"

"Julia Richmond?"

There was no answer. I looked over and saw Julia's desk empty. She hadn't been to school for the last two days. I checked my phone, there were no texts from her, only a TON from Jason, and a TON from Nathan.

"Does anyone know how to contact Julia?"

I raised my hand, the class glanced over at me. "What are you doing! Don't do that, you're going to have to go and see her" someone said.

"Great, Colita! Can you call her after class to see how she is doing?"

The glares were still focused on me but slowly went away. It seemed like Julia really was not popular at all. I just got to this school and I was the only one with her number. 
I did as the teacher said and called her after class. It rang, but she didn't pick up. I left her a voice message saying I hoped she'd come back, I missed her, and the teacher wondered where she was.

At lunchtime I checked the phone again, but there was still no answer from her. I went to the teacher's office to ask for her address. I would go and visit her tonight.

One of the teacher's a lady who taught geography looked me up and down. She looked about thirty something, my age. She was impressed, "Such a pretty girl, and you're making friends with everyone, you are a great example to all of the other students, keep it up" Then she went back to the phone call she was having with what sounded like one of her girl friends.

I took my tray and went to sit down, but turned to face Nathan.

"Where are you going to sit?" he said, he was also holding his tray, he must have gone to a different stall and just caught up to me.

"None of your business, I go where I want"

"And I'll go where you want to go" he tagged behind me.

"Don't you have any sense of pride or independence?" I said, "It's because of people like you who just follow everything that everyone says that our country is goes to ruins."

"I love it" Nathan showed me his teeth, "I love our country to go to ruins" 

I sighed, there really was no hope for him. I spent what felt like the whole day running around after Julia, now I just wanted some peace and quiet.

I turned to Nathan and pointed to the 'popular' table. "I'm sitting there, wanna come?"

Nathan's smile dropped when he saw which table I was pointing at. "Colita, that's the beast's table, and Matt is there as well"

I chuckled Nathan just said that Lacey was the beast, then I covered my mouth in embarrassment when I saw Nathan staring at me, did I actually make that of sound? What did he think when he saw that? Colita, grow up, please please please. Nathan's funny, but you're a mature woman already, you should have it under control.

Nathan grabbed my arm and stopped me. "We can go anywhere else, I just don't want to go there with the beast"

"Exactly my point" I raised my chin and started walking to the table, "I can go anywhere without you"

We stood at the table with Lacey and Matt looking up at us, their whole gang was around them.

"You want to sit down?" One of the guys on the football team said. I smiled a them, but caught Lacey's gaze immediately. Her eyes were on fire.

I gave her my best can-I-be-your-friend-even-though-I-don't-really-want-to-be smile.

Then Lacey gave me her best I-love-you-even-though-I-actually-totally-completely-utterly-immersively-lifechangingly-hate-your-guts smile.

So I guess that was a yes. 

I pulled out a chair and sat down. Nathan stood behind me. "Where can I sit?" he whispered. I think even he was afraid of Lacey, to him, following me here must have been hard. 

"You can go and be with Lacey, keep her company" I shooed him off. He stood back and glided like a fly towards Lacey. Her frown got bigger and bigger until it looked like a mountain. But as soon as Matt looked at her she was smiling again.

Wow, this girl could act.

"I'm so glad you are able to join us Colita" Lacey cocked her head, "Most people are afraid to sit here, but there's nothing to be afraid of. You seem to be a very strong willed person Colita."

"Thanks" I said, "A lot of fantasies are just not worth worrying about"

Nathan nodded, "Colita doesn't understand anything about 

Ever since I sat down, Matt was staring at me. And it wasn't an incognito stare like he spies in the movies, Matt was staring at me shamelessly like he always did, except that this time he was in front of Lacey.

And Lacey didn't like it. She pulled the hem of her uniform down closer to her chest, she wrapped her fingers around her hair to make it look like an exquisite flower. She even took his free hand and put it on her cheek. 

"Baby, I feel a bit sick" she rubbed his palm on her cheek, "Do you think I should go to the nurse room?" 

I rolled my eyes, she would do anything to grab his attention, it was so annoying to watch.

Matt turned to her and touched her carefully, running his palm up and down her cheek. The way he moved his hand, it was like he really enjoyed her.

Seriously, he was staring at me one moment, then now he was feeling her up? Did he have no integrity of woman? He was just looking at whichever of us he wanted, without caring for our feelings or anything like that.

I puffed my cheeks and stared back at Matt. I wanted to let him know that this was not okay. I didn't want to see this, I had a moral conduct to uphold.

But Matt didn't notice me, he was delicately running his fingers over her cheeks and lips as if I wasn't even there. Lacey looked at me, she wore a huge grin that she could barely conceal. She was winning this fight, she was trying to make me look bad.

"This is delicious" Nathan was eating his bread, completely in another world. Boys were always clueless.

"You should go to the nurse room" Matt took his hand off her cheek and inspected her forehead "Lacey, you look a bit pale."

Uhh...maybe she looked pale because she was...WHITE? I decided not to say that, I was here to be Matt's best friend, but his extra possessive super annoying girlfriend kept on eyeing me like an enemy.

Lacey frowned at me mockingly before turning back to Matt. "Are you sure baby?" Anyone could see she was touched, like he had just recited one of Shakespeare's sonnets with the whole atmosphere and everything and was offering it to her.

[(Add in what I saw in the Japanese girl, 
she is amazed by what he says, because some of it is true, he sees some things in her that she didn't see. and becasue he cares for her so much)]
Yet she lets Matt touch her instead. How important is this job to her?

Matt looked at me out of the corner of his eye before whispering something in Lacey's ear. Was he doing this to provoke me, couldn't he see me right here?

Lacey lit up like a red light, she looked around proudly. "Okay" she said.

I don't know what he said, but it made me upset. Why couldn't they just talk normally, instead of whispering around like it was a big secret or something. 
Matt looked genuinely concerned for Lacey. I wanted to yell at him, didn't he see what a big spoilt brat she was?

Lacey stood up, she announced to everyone, by everyone I mean me. Her eyes condescended down onto me. "I'm going to the nurse room because I don't feel well. Matt told me I should go." She put her hands on her hips. "He already told me he doesn't like you so don't get your hopes up."

That made me angry, there was no need to say that. 

As Lacey walked off she turned around a couple of times to look at me, and at Matt to make sure there was no funny business happening.

I looked up at Matt. I was pretty sure he could see the bubbles of anger boiling onto my face. I was pathetic, if the school knew who I really was, they would laugh at me.

But Matt stared at me silently. With the same intense gaze that made me want to shrink away and hide. 

I reminded myself that he hated me, Lacey had made it clear, besides, to him I was nothing but a creepy stalker always trying to be by his side. He didn't see anything in me, and I would probably just fail my last angel mission. I sighed, I really was no good at doing anything.

Then Matt reached over and took my water.

"What are you doing?" I said.

He brought it to his lips and poured it down his throat without answering,

"That's Colita's water" Nathan said, finally noticing something happening around him. I had brought him hoping he would act as a buffer for the Lacey-Matt duo but up till now he had been completely useless.

"I was thirsty" Matt wiped his lips.

It wasn't a big deal, but I was fuming, he kept doing these things over and over and they piled up into a tower. He stepped over me like I wasn't even there. "Stop taking my things" I said, "A girl is like a work of art, we're not perfect, we're meant to be worked on and treated with concentration and attention. I have real feelings, just you're some super rich and popular guy at this school or whatever, you can't tread over other's real feelings you know. Guys like you are the worst."

Matt grinned, ignoring me again. "Come" he gripped my wrist midway while I was eating and pulled my hand. 

"What are you doing?" I looked at Nathan for some backup, but he looked too amazed to act. 

"Matt's giving you attention" he said, "I've never seen Matt care about anyone"

He dropped my arm and walked around the table. He grabbed my wrist once he was on this side then pulled me behind him like I was a dog on his leash. I was a thirty three year old grown woman, yet I was trying my best and still couldn't control this wild boy. This beast

I looked at the back of Matt's figure as he led me away from the cafeteria and from all the stares that followed wherever he went. I glanced down, my wrist was still being held by him firmly, where was he leading me?

I tried to pull loose but he wouldn't let me, he was strong. "Let go of me" I said, "What will Lacey think if she sees you taking me away like this"

"She's annoying" he said, "I don't care if she sees us"

"She'll be really upset and mad" he wasn't pulling me anymore, I was walking next to him now. 

"To me, she's not as scary as you are" he said, "You are able to make me tremble in excitement, or become really sad, sadder than I've ever been. That's very scary"

Now he slowed down, we were in some corridor somewhere, on the first floor next to some quiet classrooms. Matt was staring at me looking over like a true person. I didn't feel anything condescending in him. Then his eyes came down and stared at my chest. I crossed my arms and looked at him. "What are you doing"

When he realized I realized, he blinked and stood back. "Whoah, what am I doing, that's really bad behaviour, sorry" He rubbed his head and said he needed to tell me something.

"I'm listening" I said.

"Do you like me or something? You're always following me"

I hoped Jason hadn't told him anything.

I shook my head, "I don't like you, you must be imagining it"

"Then why do you keep approaching me and Lacey?" he said. "Usually people are too afraid to do so. I'm scary, Lacey's scary"

"You're friendly" I said, "Lacey's a knife, but you're fun to be around" Max would be proud of me, I was getting closer to the one person I had to be with.

Matt stared back. "How can you be so rude, no one's ever spoken to me like that before"

"Do you feel proud that others are afraid of you? Does it make you feel like an alpha male who is dominating all the females in estrus? Is that what it is?"

He didn't answer, I don't know if he physically had the ability to. The conversation fell silent again, maybe we just weren't made for talking to each other. Our personalities were too different. 

But whenever the conversation died, I knew what he was doing, where he was looking. I glanced up at him slowly to make it obvious to him that I knew. Sure enough, he was looking at the twins Josie and Yosie. He wasn't just glancing, he was staring hard. I mean seriously focused. I sighed, why couldn't he put that focus into things like study.

"Do you like Lacey?" I said.

His gaze broke off briefly and fluttered between my eyes and my chest like a butterfly.

"I like her" he said. 

"Do you like me?" For some reason I wanted to know.

He nodded.

"Then who do you like more?" I put my hands on my hips, "Lacey or me?"

"I don't know" he said. He was staring at my breasts again.

I changed the topic "Matt, do you know that you are fortunate?"

He shook his head, "I'm not fortunate, there are so many luckier ones than me"

"You're very fortunate" I had seen the world, I knew when someone was lucky. A well off person looked like Matt.

He smiled, "You sound like my Mom, she always used to say that kind of stuff"

I frowned, I didn't want to be compared to his Mom. Was he completely clueless as to how the world worked? People had to work, they had bosses to talk to and taxes to pay. A rich go lucky boy like him would never know.

But of course, he was staring at my chest again. His mouth practically watering. It was dangerous for me to be with him here, he could do anything to me.

"Matt" I said. "What do you do with Lacey?" I was shy to ask this, it was none of my business "When you're alone with her"

"It's none of your business" he said.

"Well maybe you should think about sorting your life out, doing something worthwhile and meaningful for the world. What do you think?"
He came closer, "I don't want you to talk to me about my life, it's none of your business, do you understand?" He looked angry, really angry, like he might punch me if I pressed further.

But I wasn't scared. "Then how can you look at me like that, I know what you're thinking about when you look at me, it's perverted, like an animal watching me. Do you look at everyone like that?"

Matt looked up at me briefly, then back down. "I know it's bad, but you're so sexy" he said, "Way sexier than Lacey and any other girl I've ever known."

I grinned, "Come here" I pulled him closer. He blinked, he could feel my warm breath on his neck. "We won't talk about your life anymore, just enjoy yourself"

"For a few minutes" I said, "I'll let you do what you like with me, anything. You can touch me anywhere, just for a few minutes."
 
Matt's eyes gaped wide. "Lacey...I mean, Colita, are you serious?"

"I'm Colita, not Lacey" I said, "Hurry up before I change my mind"

Matt was flabbergasted. "You mean I can do...anything?"

I ran my hands down myself, "This, is yours, do whatever you need"

### Chapter Seven - Colita the Beast

He wasn't afraid of Lacey finding out, he leapt onto me and grabbed my breasts through my shirt, rubbing his palms over them. Then he pulled his lips onto mine, inhaling in my scent.

I let him do what he wanted. I was actually excited to be so close to him, I had watched him from afar as he kissed Lacey, and now he was kissing me, greedily, hungry for more.

His palms pressed against my breasts and made them twitch and rise. My breathing deepened. He held my legs and pressed me against the lockers. Chains rattled on them. 

Anyone might walk past and see us. Then the whole school would find out that Matt was making out with me.

Some really deep part of me, disgusting part of me wanted that to happen, I wanted the school to know that Matt was mine. That he was desperate for me and completely under my control.

But if I let him go too far, he might forget about me.

Matt's palms were wet with sweat, he groaned as he massaged my breasts, then he reached down and unbuttoned my shirt. Soon my buttons were off and he flung my bra away. His fingers were on my raw flesh. Like an animal, he leaned down and sucked my nipples, making them harder and stretching towards him.

The cold air ran against my hair and body, but my chest was warm from his sucking, like a baby.
"I love you" he said, "Colita, you're the best"

"Does she let you touch her like this?" I said. "Do you...touch...Lacey like this?" I managed to say it through the licks twists he was giving me, it was making it hard to talk.

"That's none of your business" he lifted his fingers and squeezed my nipple. Again, I felt a warmth pulse through my body and all the way to my core.

I pulled his hand away. "Does she?" I asked earnestly. I had to keep him under MY control.

He looked up, noticing that I had a voice, and a face and feelings for what seemed like the first time. "She lets me go all the way" he said. "So I've seen everything"

"Everything?" These high school kids had sex?

Matt looked at me, "But she's not half as pretty as you, your body is the best in this school" I noticed that my nipples were wet from his saliva, and his mouth was still watering. Like he was eating the best most delicious fruit in the world

He reached out to my skirt and peeled it up. I didn't resist, I let him have his way. 

"Are you sure?" he looked around. "We're in school"

"So?" I looked at my watch. "You have five minutes left, before kids come streaming in and seeing us"

Matt's eye widened, "I can touch you down there?"

If he had touched Lacey, then I had to let him as well. He rubbed his hands up my legs, and places his fingers on the inside of my thighs. I felt his fingernails against my skin, they moved closer and closer up me. I leaned back and moaned in anticipation, this was sooo good. My back arched as I widened my entrance for him to move in.

Matt moved forward. HIs fingers were tracing the outline of my underwear, but they didn't move closer, just lying around there. Then I felt his lips on my right nipple, gripping licking the tip of it.

I let out a loud moan, this was too good. I was enjoying this far more than I expected. He was licking me and massaging me.

"Pinch my nipples" I said. "I like it when you pinch them hard"

Matt listened to me and pinched them, just hard enough to almost be painful, then he let go and feeling flowed back in.

I lifted my hand and tried to peel his shirt off, but he didn't let me, so I moved them down and started playing with myself. My panties were soaked, I wanted them off, and my shoes as well. I never wanted to be more naked.

But Matt stopped there, his hand hovered over my breasts kneading them like dough, and his knee at my crotch, but not progressing further.

"What happened?" I said.

"I can't" he said. "I'm going out with Lacey, she will be really hurt"

When he said that, my blood tingled, "She's just using you" I said, "You're just the ladder she's climbing to become the most popular."

"But, I should tell her, I should break up with her first" Matt said, he was still massaging my breasts and moving my nipples round in circles.

"She will never know" I said, "You can just break up with her later, and she will never have to know"

Matt sighed, "But I've known Lacey for a really long time" he looked at my eyes, "I've only known you for two weeks or something" He lifted his hands slowly off me.

But I grabbed them and put them back on my breasts, moving his hands around on me. Like this I would lose, I needed him to go further.

"Do you like me?" I said. 

"I love you" Matt looked at me, all over me.

I flipped my skirt up, then slipped my panties off, getting them past my toes and hanging them off my finger in front of his face. "Smell them"

He frowned, "I don't want to go further than this, I lied, actually Lacey doesn't let me do anything, only kissing, I haven't even got to second base with her yet, I just wanted to get further with you, so I lied."

It was too late for me to care, I just wanted him in me. That was all I could think about. As Matt smelled my panties, I unzipped his fly and grabbed the treasure that lay beneath.

I pulled out my phone from my skirt that was lying on the ground and texted Lacey, asking her to come and see something on the first floor corridor.

Matt dropped the panties, "You're such a bad girl" he said, "Colita, you're so bad, you have to promise me not to tell anyone about this, not a soul, and definitely not Lacey."

I smiled and spread my legs, of course not.

Matt looked around, "You're letting me have sex with you? In the school?"

"Hurry up" I said. I stroked myself and helped him enter. His shirt was still on but his lower half was bare, he began grunting as he moved in and out of me.

"You're such a pervert Colita" he leaned down and kissed me on the lips. I gave a moan and his thrusts intensified. I looked around to see whether she was here, whether she was watching. But she wasn't yet.

I started moving my hips up against him, but not going too fast. I grabbed his hair in my hands and pulled on it like grass.

"It's my first time" he said, "I can't believe it, this is in fricken school, and we're doing this. Don't tell Lacey alright?"

"Al...right" I barely managed to say. He was grunting like an animal, and I moved against him. I hadn't had someone inside me in such a long time, this was refreshing and a good change.

It was stupid to say I was touched and felt proud, of this body that I had conjured up. It was making these guys around me fall from their strength.

Then Matt twitched. He looked to his left turning his neck slowly.

The sight brought me pleasure beyond anything. Revenge. Lacey was walking up to us in her uniform, her expensive heels, and her clothes were perfectly arranged. She peered across the room at us, first at Matt, then at me, lying stark naked beneath him, with my legs wrapped around him and moaning Matt's name.

"Matt" she said.

I felt Matt's tool shrink and wither inside me. "Hi Lacey" he said. I wondered what he would do. How long it would take him run back and apologize. He stopped moving for a second, then picked me up again. 

"Matt, what are you doing!" Lacey shrieked, she ran over and began slapping his back, his bottom, and kicking his legs. 

I was surprised, Matt didn't care, he was too much focused on the task at hand. Letting himself go inside me.

I moaned more, just to get on Lacey's nerves. It worked, she ran around to face me and tried to attack me, words didn't cut it, she tried to pull us apart.

But Matt pushed her aside, then began pounding me again, this time more desperately to get it finished. 

"Stop it" Lacey was wailing, "Stop it Colita, that's my boyfriend, Matt, don't you have any sense? I thought we promised to do it at prom, why are you doing this with her?" She pointed her finger at me.

"I'm breaking up with you" Matt said. "I'm sick of you Lacey, besides, Colita's so much more sexier than you are, I deserve better"

Lacey couldn't leave, she tried to pull Matt of me, she tried kicking me, but none of it was any use. Matt kept pounding into me, and I cried in pleasure.

Lacey was crying, she turned her head away, then back, then away. "Stop, please stop" she said, "Colita, please stop"

The bell rang, and Matt pulled out, dripping from sweat. I put my clothes back on, when I looked around, Lacey was gone.

"Where did she go?" I said. I brushed my hair with my hand, trying to smooth it out a bit.

"I think she called Jason over as well" he said. "They were both watching us" Matt grinned, "You're so disgusting Colita, but I have to admit, it was one of the most fun things I've done.

"Good" I walked off.

### Chapter Eight - Julia the Stepping Stone

The next day Julia finally came to school. Her hair was meticulously done up, and she was wearing some new earrings, but she was still the same Julia. Quiet, sensitive, and following me around.

But even the gossip had reached Julia.

"Did you...with Matt?" she leaned in and asked me as soon as she got the first opportunity.

I nodded, "Yeah, cool huh?"

Julia's eyes became marbles, "Colita, that's amazing, and in school as well?" 

"I just was getting sick of Lacey" I said. Besides, it would help me get closer to Matt if Lacey was out of the picture. “Julia, haven't you ever felt close to someone else?”

“Yes” she thought about it, “My brother, he's two years older than me, so he's two years sadder than me as well.”

“Sadder? Are you sad? Is he sad?”

“Well, not really” she said, “It's just how I like to put things. My older brother is kind of handicapped, he was born with a sickness, so he kind of ran away.”

“Ran away? I'm sorry to hear that Julia, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to”

Julia's voice didn't change, not at all, she spoke in the same monotone as if she had lost the importance of her words, “Yeah, you see the stars in the sky? He said that everytime I looked up I should know that one of those stars was him. He was watching me.”

“Why did he run away?” I said. “If you don't mind me asking, of course”

“No, it's fine” she said, “He said that death was right behind him, he felt like he might not last much longer, so he wanted to run away. So one day we woke up and he was gone. Mom didn't cry though, she knew it was what was best for him”

Julia obviously thought this was normal, her mind had been warped. I didn't even know how much of this story to believe. But we soon got back to daily life, when Julia sat down to write in her daily to-do list, she covered her right hand. Otherwise she was the same timid Julia who agreed with everything I said. "Can I borrow your eraser Colita?" she said. "Then later tell me all about what happened"

Others didn't know why I was friends with Julia, especially the girls around Lacey. They thought I was throwing my popularity down the drain by hanging out with Julia. But Julia seemed to be grateful of me, so I didn't mind.

Besides, there were things more important than popularity.

I didn't see Lacey all day, she hadn't come to school. But, Jason was looking at me with a strange expression. During Geography, I went out to the bathroom, then happened to run into Jason. He saw me, then looked away and walked past me, as if he didn't notice me.

"Jason" I said, "Is that how you treat a friend?" I wiped my hands clean on a paper towel and chucked it away. "I thought we were friends, why are you ignoring me?"

"I'm not ignoring you" Jason said. "You're ignoring me"

"Are you crazy?" I said, "You just pretended like you didn't see me"

"Are you crazy?" Jason said, there was mirth when he spoke. "I didn't tell anyone about us kissing, because you asked me not to"

I smiled, "Thank you Jason, I'm really happy about that, it saved me a lot of trouble."

Jason clenched his fists, "I've never wanted to punch a girl before, but right now, I want to punch you so much."

"Tell me what you want" I said, "What's bothering you"

"Stop talking to me like you're so much older and understand everything" He pointed at me, "You're a lying cheat, you slept with my best friend, then made Lacey come and watch. You bitch, I hate you, I don't know what I ever saw in you, I thought you were nice, you're a horrible person, I hope you leave this school."

He was yelling at me, trying to offend me, I kept my cool. "Lacey was being horrible to me" I said, "SO I just her something back"

"You took Matt's virginity, in the school!" he said.

"So? I did him a favour helping him to lose it, now he can show off to all the boys right?"
He came over and grabbed my collar, "Did you know that Lacey and Matt grew up together for years? They've been in the same schools since primary, they were even prepared to marry, and you just ripped it apart." He stared into my eyes, looking for anything, some sign of weakness.

"I'm sorry, I'm not that weak a person" I said. "Matt was the one who had the choice to stop, he kept going"

"Us guys" Jason was yelling so loud that I could swear everyone down the corridor heard him. "We find it hard to control ourselves already, if you offer yourself out like that of course he'll take it, we can't control ourselves."

He was talking to me like I didn't know anything about guys. "Be quiet" I said, "Everyone can hear you"

"Stop telling me what to do, I'm never listening to you again" Jason screamed, "The point was, that I liked you, and I thought you liked me too, but I was wrong" He let go of my collar and took a few steps back. "You're the worst type of girl, a vain, shallow, slut."

I smoothed out my collar, "I'm going to pretend I never heard that, and if you're going to speak to me like that, I don't want to be your friend any more." I left him standing there in the corridor and went back to class.

During break time I sat with Matt, on opposite ends of the table. No one else sat with us, not even Matt's friends. I guess they all saw him differently as well.

Come on, it was only sex.

As I sat eating in silence, I looked up at Matt, wondering what he thought, did he dislike me as well? Did he also think that I had used him?

"How are you feeling Colita?" Matt said. "Is everyone upset at you?"

"Yeah" I put a dumpling in my mouth, "But I don't mind it" This gossip and backstabbing was so beneath me.

"Lacey didn't come to school" Matt said. 

"You guys are broken up right?" I said.

"Yeah" Matt said, "It shouldn't be any of my business any more, but I grew up with her, I care about her"

I leaned across the table, "Then why did you sleep with me?"

Matt blushed, "I...I..."

I laughed, "I'm just joking, it's not a big deal, trust me, we'll grow out of this"

"You speak like you've done it all before"

"Do I?" I smiled.

Then Julia came and joined our table. She said her class had finished late, so she only made time to come over just now. I made a space for her and sat down.
Then Matt began to open up, as if he felt less awkward. "Lacey's body is so good, yet it can't compare to something like that" he pointed to me, "Everything about you is..."

Julia also looked up and down me, "Hmm" she murmured. She studied my figure carefully. "What do you eat, and what do you not eat?" she said, "How do you keep yourself so slim"

I decided to tell them the truth. "It's magic" I said, "I have a superpower that keeps me slim."

Matt burst out laughing, "The way you said that, it was funny." Julia smiled as well. I noticed that as she ate, she kept her left hand wrapped around her right wrist.

"Julia" Matt said, "I have to tell you this, but you realize that Colita is a special girl?"

Julia nodded, "Yes, I like her very much"

"Then do you know that you will never be like her? Even if you follow her around all the time"

He had said that out of nowhere. "Stop it Matt" I tried to hush him, but he smiled at me and kept going. "Colita is good at studies, she has an awesome personality, and she's smoking hot, you can never be like her"

"You don't need to say that" I said, then turned to Julia, "It's not true Julia, don't listen to him."

"I'm just educating her" Matt said, "She needs to develop a personality, I've seen her following you around the whole time"

"It's fine, I don't mind it" I said.

"I mind it" Matt said. He leaned over and talked to Julia, "You're not very pretty, so you shouldn't be around Colita, you even make her look worse, so go and find some new friends"

Then Matt stood up and smiled to us both. "Hope you listen to my advice Julia, it will do you good as well"

Julia didn't talk for a long time after he left, she didn't even lift her fork up to eat.

"Don't listen to him, he's just an insensitive jerk" I said, "I don't know what he was thinking" She still didn't answer, she sat there quietly, not touching her food. People kept walking past us, staring at us, they probably also thought we were a weird couple.

"He just has to be rude to make himself feel better" I said, "Guys need everything to be in black and white, and stand above everyone. I don't really like him, he thinks he's all amazing."

Julia said something, so quietly that I could barely hear it.

"What?" I said.

"It's true" she said. "Everything he said is true, I'm just a disgusting creature who always hides behind and follows you, I have no personality and no ideas of my own"
She spoke like she was reciting a textbook. 

But even a textbook couldn't sound so sad.

"Julia, are you alright?" I said, "You haven't been coming to school a lot recently, are you feeling okay?" Yup that's right, I was deciding to have 'the chat' with her. It was time.

"I'm fine" she said, "Sorry Colita for causing you trouble, I won't follow you any more"

"I don't mind you following me" I said. "I like to talk to you and do stupid things with you and laugh about them, what's more important is that you feel that you can be yourself"

Julia stood up, she held her plate in front of her for a while, then dropped all the food in the trash and walked off.

She could have at least thanked me for helping her

I learnt that Julia had left school straight after lunch, she had walked out the gates and gone home.

---

### Chapter Nine - Colita the Friend

On my way home from school, I took a long look at the sign. Our high school was supposed to be a place for education, but there was nothing about education happening, it was all gossip and backstabbing and popularity play. I was lucky that I wasn't these kids' age, otherwise I would be feeling really upset. 

High school wasn't easy to get through, especially as a girl. And I guess my actions with Matt were really out of peoples' radar, no one had sex on campus, not even Lacey. So it completely shocked them.

But it also felt good to get back at Lacey, and to claim Matt for my self.

My homeroom teacher Mr. Gilbert had also noticed that Julia had recently not been attending classes, so he asked me to go over to her house and ask her what was happening. I guess he asked me because Julia and I were always together, at least when she came to school.

I told him that I would check up on her.

So being a student meant that I also had to do other things than study, I was starting to forget what it felt like to be a student, but I had responsibilities to uphold, reputations to maintain, and academics to impress.

I touched my necklace, I was an angel, I could never forget that, no matter how I acted and looked, even if everyone thought I was a human, I wasn't, I was an angel, and there was a great divide that separated us from humans.

I stood next to the address on the list, I stood next to her house. It was a plain middle-class house with the front gate hanging ajar. I called out "Julia, are you there" And entered with the lack of a response.

The garden would have once looked beautiful, but it hadn't been tended to in a few months, maybe even years, I didn't know, I was no garden expert, no herbologist. It was overgrown with exotic looking vines sitting comfortably on the path.

I stepped over the obstacles and made my way to the door. I wondered if Julia's parents were home, they were sure to be. It was already four pm, the summer sun was still high.

I hoped her parents would be there, it might get awkward. At school I wasn't wrong, I know that I saw slit marks on Julia's wrists. Why was she cutting herself? Did it give her pleasure? 

I knocked on the door and waited for scuttling footsteps or whatever I am supposed to be waiting for in these situations.

There was no sound. So I took a deep breath and knocked again.

The result was the same, no matter how many times I knocked there was no response. I was a sensible and logical thinking human being, I could learn from repetition, namely that no matter how many times I repeated an action there would be no change in the result.

The windows looked secure, and really clean. I bet Julia's Mom wouldn't enjoy my fingermarks on her window.

I sighed. I guess these were all signs for me to turn back. It was a pity, this house looked really nice, I would have loved to have a coffee here with Julia or something.

But do you remember how I said us angels just aren't the same as humans? Well this was one example. When I turned back, I felt something instinctively telling me that something needed fixing, really urgently.

I turned back and noticed Julia's shoes on the deck, sitting there quietly, arranged into a cute parallel. I walked to them for any clues. They were placed outside the deck, as if they were inviting me in.

The verandah door was open. It was the sliding door type, but it was open, and a curtain was hanging across it, the tip of it sucked out towards me by the wind, rippling like a ballerina.

"Julia?" I called. "Are you there? How come you didn't come to school these last days, everyone's worried about you"

I heard my voice echo through the house. The wallpaper was white, the desk was organized and tidy. There was a notebook of things to do on the kitchen counter. I could see all of this from the entrance but I dared not enter. This wasn't my house, I had to respect that. Julia had probably just gone out to buy something quickly before coming back.

Without her shoes...?

Her shoes were still here. I took off my shoes and stepped inside. My angel gut feeling was telling me that Julia was in trouble. I walked around, then headed to the second floor. I went up the steps but there was still nothing. 

I bet I looked like a robber right now. I even felt like one myself.
I would open Julia's room door and if she wasn't there, I would leave. It was none of my business to be here. Julia would be upset to learn that.

I quietly pushed open a few doors, the first was a closet with a vacuum cleaner tucked in the lower corner. The next was Julia's parents' room. The last room I opened was decorated with pink wallpaper. The curtains were strung across, letting in a pale yellow light and streaking it across the carpet. The bed was messy and some underwear was thrown across it, like pepper on a salad.

"Julia?" I called for the last time, if she wasn't here I would leave. It was getting weird just being her without her. The room was very messy, skinny jeans were lying on the floor, the kind of jeans I had never seen Julia wear, she always wore baggy stuff, and a few exotic belts.

There was a loud bang, I turned around, thinking that someone came home, but there was no follow through. Probably the wind had slammed a door downstairs.

I walked into the room unconsciously, I was fascinated by Julia's stuff, she had so much, but hardly any of it she wore to school. Necklaces, earrings, high heels, mascara of all colors. Even I didn't have anything like this, and I was a thirty three year old mature woman.

Then I saw Julia, but not in a way I wanted to. There was an open door leading to an ensuite bathroom, and in the bath, lying down with her arms out of the tub, was Julia. 

She wasn't moving, her head was still, her arms were still, and her chest wasn't breathing.

"Julia?" I cried out and ran over, grabbing her head. She was cold. Dead cold. I grabbed her wrists, they were crusty with dried blood. Her lips and eyes were closed. Her hair had collected the first traces of dust, making her an artifact.

"Julia!" I couldn't help but scream, what had she done? I leaned down to listen for breathing, there was none. 

My hand went to my mouth and I screamed.

Julia was dead.

---

### Chapter Ten - Colita the Angel

I had seen many dead people before. The job kind of asked for it. But I had never seen a dead person that I knew. All of them had been strangers, or people I didn't know anything about and hadn't invested anything into, emotionally.

But this was different. Julia was a girl at my school, I had felt close to her, liked her like family. Why had she done something like this? This wasn't like her, she was supposed to be a happy confident girl who was always asking me questions and laughing with me, asking me answers for the homework and chatting to me about everything.

But she couldn't speak any more.

I collapsed on the tub, wrapping my arms around her head, putting my hand on her lips.

"Why did you do this Julia? If you were so sad we could have talked, you didn't have to do this, you have so many friends who would love to support you. Just come and talk to us." I felt wet porous tears drooping down my cheeks, my eyelashes were stained with her make-up, and her mascara was pollinating my forehead. 

"Julia, say something" 

She lay there quietly, not saying a word. Never saying a word again.

I brought out my phone and started dialling 111. They would HAVE to do something. But I cut it off. If I did that, then Julia's Mum and Dad would find out, and the whole school would as well. 

Besides, there was nothing they could do. Julia had been gone for a few days already. I felt so bad that I hadn't noticed it earlier, she was depressed but she hadn't shown any signs, she hadn't told me anything out of the ordinary, it just happened. I read somewhere that 25% of depressed people were like that, without any external signs, they did it.

I sobbed and cried into Julia's chest, putting my hands on her cheeks and hoping she would love herself more, treat herself better.

Then I put a hand on my necklace. It was prohibited by angel law to heal a human out of your mission. The only one I could use my powers on was Matt, and even that was only if I asked for Max's approval.

I looked down at Julia, tears streaming down my eyes and landing on her cheeks. My hair dangled down and brushed the edge of her cheeks and her ears. What would her parents feel, I couldn't even imagine the pain they would go through. And how about me. I would lose a friend.

"Julia" I said, mainly to myself. "I'm going to do something, but you can't tell anyone, okay?" I paused for a moment and stared at her, as if she was going to answer.

Then I cried again. She was too beautiful, too amazing to go like this. I had to break the rules, I had to save Julia.

I closed my eyes and put my hands on my necklace. It glowed a bright yellow. With my left hand I slid the curtain away so that the small ray of sunlight from the window would hit her. Then with my other hand I beside Julia's head so I could lean down carefully.

Then, with my necklace glowing bright, and the tips of my hair floating, I went down towards Julia and put my lips on her, giving her a kiss. Pressing my lips against hers. I held that position for a while, letting my healing powers flow into her, letting her lips slowly grow warm as her heart started pumping. Letting her eyes see once more, and her fingers to feel. Her breast heaved once or twice as life came back into her. 

Life was all around us, but once it left us humans couldn't bring it back. Only angels could direct the whereabouts of life. That's why we were so valuable to humans.

I was committing a cardinal sin by doing this.

My kiss of life woke Julia up. But it would take her a few more minutes to regain consciousness, and then another few minutes before she would remember what happened. I had done it so many times before that it was supposed to be routine, everyday.

But not with Julia, it wasn't. I clenched my heart, feeling really tired. Healing someone wasn't easy, a scar required considerable energy. Healing a person who had been dead was a lot harder. I would need a few days to recover from this.

Julia stirred, her hair moved, her fingers touched. I stood up to walk out. This part was always the hardest, I felt like a mother parting with her child. I had too much oxytocin for this to happen easily. Julia's legs moved, and she started breathing audibly. Her day was starting. A new life had returned to this world.

I realized I was still crying, this was the most beautiful part of life. To return it.

"Julia" I didn't want her to hear me but I had to say it anyway. I couldn't let her know I was an angel, if that happened then I would really lose my job. 

"Julia, I missed you" I walked out silently.

Your Author 

The phone call that night back to Angel Corp was torture. It went something like this...

"Hi Colita"

"Umm...Max?"

"I see you used your powers. Did Matt need healing? You remembered to make sure not to let him see it right?"

"Umm...I may or may not have, I may have healed someone who wasn't on my mission."

Max replied immediately "That's very bad, Colita."

"And what if I may or may not have revived them as well?"

"That's worse, it's not your decision to give or take life, it's God's" Max was reciting the words we all recited before becoming angels. "But you didn't right?"

"And what if I may or may not have let them know that I was an angel and not a human?"

"Then you will have to be removed from the agency" Max said. "But why are you asking Colita? You didn't do anything like that right? If you did, then I may or may not have to exert my authority"

"I may have" I said, "I may not have" I didn't want to lie to him.

"Well then, I may or may not be angry right now depending on what you may or may not have done."

"I may understand you, I may not, depending on which may you take into consideration..."

"Alright Colita, stop playing around. Let's talk about something more important"

"Yessssie!" I gave him my planning-girl-smile and twiddled my fingers in glee. "Yes let's"

"Colita, Do you know Colessa?"

"You mean the-really-successful-famous-angel-Mirana's-equally-successful-older-sister-Colessa?"

"That's it" Max said, he was chewing something on the other side, probably eating dinner. I missed angel food, it as sooo much better than the stupid food we got here. "Well Colessa's also going to join you on your mission"

"You're not serious right?" I said. 

"I'm serious" 

I knew that Max was always serious, he was as interesting as a rock, the last time he made a joke was back in 1963, and it was a shocker.

"Why is Colessa coming?" I said, "I've got everything under control, Matt is fine, and I'm doing really well here."

"Colita" Max said, his tone made me shut right up. "You need to learn when to listen to things people tell you. I said Colita is going over so I need you to listen okay? You can both work together and accomplish a lot."

From my guess, Colessa was a few years older than me, but several times more accomplished. I didn't even compare to a strand of her hair. The rumors said that everything about her was perfect, she even pooped gold.

I groaned, "Please Max, I can do it myself, I've been doing well so far right?"

"You have" Max agreed. "It seems like it's a good environment for you" 

"Well then pleeeassse, can I do this alone?" I whined with my cutest highest pitched voice. It would have an effect on any man in the world, instantly persuading them.

Every man except Max.

"She's also going to be dressed up" Max said, "She'll go over and say hi to you tomorrow, just make sure to update on the situation and whatever's happening."

"Okaaay..."

Max didn't drop the receiver, we both listened to each other breathing through it on the other end. His breath was calm and rusty, mine was probably wheezy and agitated. Perfect matches.

"Colita, I'm not sending Colessa because of punishment" he said, "I've gotten reports that something really big is going to happen, and you will need someone's help there." He paused, "It's not because I don't think you're capable, it's actually the opposite reason that you're there. I just wanted to tell you that"

Oh Max, he always knew how to make me melt into a puddle of touchy feely fudge.

"Thanks Max" I said.

"No problem, see you next time Colita, I'm looking forward to seeing you back here when it's all over" 

"Me too" I said.

I sighed when the phone cut off. I hadn't met Colessa before, but she would probably be all about the rules, telling me to do this and that as politely as she could.

My freedom was over. That meant I had to light another cigarette. I smoked it hard, knowing that once Colessa was here, so was Mrs. Perfect.

The next day I wore my skirt extra short. I would try to at least get the boys on my side, this was my school, I had been here longer. I hitched it up my waist and went through to homeroom. Julia was sitting in her usual spot and waved and smiled to me when I walked in. She was wearing long sleeves, to hide the cuts across her wrist.

"Colita" she said, "You're finally here, I wanted to talk to you about something" She acted as if nothing major had happened, as if she had never...you know...DIED>???

I looked around and wondered if all the other students were the same. Did they also do things at home and then come to school dressed in normal uniform and normal smiles and normal talk, as if nothing had happened?

I was one to speak, I was a fricken angel, not even a human being, but coming here to a human school every day.

"Are you okay Colita?" Julia frowned, "You look like you're stressed"

"I'm not stressed" I gave her a quick smile, "I'm just thinking about stuff. What is it you wanted to tell me?"

Julia stared at me for a while, I stared back and we both blinked. "I could tell you" she said, "But I decided not to"

"Why not?" I said.

"Because you won't believe me"

"I will, I swear I won't laugh at you, is it something serious that you need to tell others? Is it about your health and safety?" I touched her hair, "Is it something you can control Julia? You can talk to me, we're friends, that's what friends are for."
Julia put her hand on mine. "Fine" She grabbed my hand and took me out of the classroom.

"Hey girls, stay here for homeroom!" Mr. Gilbert shouted. We ignored him and giggled to underneath the staircase.

Julia immediately rolled up her sleeves and bared her wounds to me. Wounds made from a life not suited to her, a harshness that she had trouble coming to terms with.

"Oh my gosh Julia" I leaned in and inspected the wounds. They were the same as I had seen them before, but I put on a performance and pretended I had never seen them.

 "Shh, not so loud" she looked around, "I don't want anyone else to know. She brought her wrists back, "I did these, all of them"

"But why?" I said, "You poor thing, why didn't you tell me earlier?"

"Because I wasn't happy" she said, "I never am, I hate school. I'm not pretty, all the boys laugh at me and the girls tease me. I have no friends"

"Julia" I wrapped my hair back and kneeled down to look into her eyes, to let her know I was there for her. "I'm your friend Julia, we have so much fun together."

"The other day, two days ago, I tried to die" Her voice was reduced to a whisper, like the air was too much for her. "I went in the bathtub and cut myself, then let it bleed. I lost consciousness as the blood pulsed out of my hands." She sank down into the corner with her knees tucked in to her body and her hands wrapped around them. "It wasn't painful, actually I felt kind of happy"

I was glad she was being so honest with me. 

"I'm so glad you're okay" I said, "And I'm happy that you're telling me this, we can work on it together."

"I was already dead" Julia said, "I've died once already, but somehow I'm still alive now."

I hugged her, and we both started crying. My emotions were spilling out, and hers onto me, interpenetrating both of us in this small corner of the school. I wonder if anyone saw us and wondered, what kind of situation would lead to this happening.

"I'm so happy to have you as a friend Colita" Julia said, "But you're so pretty, and I'm ugly and fat, no one cares about me."

"No you're not, you're pretty, don't say that" I said.

"Well you get Jason and Matt's attention, you get to go to the movies with them and have sex with Matt. Even Lacey is useless." She shifted her head deeper into my arms. "I wish I was as pretty as you, everyone likes you and you're so popular without even trying. I want to have shiny hair like yours and long legs."

"Julia..."

"And you get to have sex with Matt" she said.

"Is that what you want? Sex with a boy?" I regretted ever doing this, if it had hurt Julia this much, what would Lacey be thinking. 

"No, my Mum always told me that I should keep myself" she said, "And I don't go to parties or anything, the boys don't look at me anyway."

"Sex isn't that great" I said. "It's just a moment, and then it's gone, it's much better to keep yourself until you're married, everyone is..."

Julia broke my sentence, "Then why are you doing it? I had no friends at this school, I was just the stress ball for everyone to hate on, the girls bullied me and the boys ignored me. But when you came here, I had a friend for the first time."

"We're still friends Julia" I said, "I like you a lot" I could smell her warmth and breath, the warmth that I had brought back, the shivering that I had recovered back.

"We're too different, boys will never look at me how they look at you, and you don't even try, you're just naturally pretty. And when I saw how popular you were, and right next to me, I just felt lonely."

"It's just because I'm the new girl" I said, "Once I'm here for a little longer..."

"Stop it, you don't have to care for me, I'm just a nuisance anyway, you're just making excuses to pretend to care for me"

I felt hurt that she would say that. I cared for her like a little sister, it was just that our circumstances were not fitting, I was older than her, and I loved her. I had forgotten how easily she was affected.

"I never told you" I said, "But I had one boyfriend right before moving to this school."

"Really?" Julia said.

"He was the only boyfriend I will ever have, I loved him because he was so considerate of me, he didn't try to act macho, and he always cared about how I was feeling and tried to make me happy. In our society it was normal that guys acted that way."

"What happened?" Julia said.

"It's a long story, but I cheated on him" I said.

Julia grinned, "You couldn't control yourself? You love sex so much?"

I sighed, "You're the one who was trying to die a moment before, you shouldn't be laughing about such things"

Julia frowned, "Fine, but you have to tell me the rest of the story, I already told you mine."

"Let's say, I helped someone who I wasn't supposed to help" that was the only way I could put it to her without exposing too much about the agency. "I'm just saying that one day the perfect boy will come along, and when you find him you need to hold onto him so he will never run away."

That was romantic love, it created an intense attachment between people, so much that the loss of them was unthinkable and unbearable.

"Is Matt your perfect guy?" she said.

"Oh gosh no" I waved it off, "He's just a hunk of meat nothing serious"

"A delicious hunk of meat?" Julia raised her eyebrows.

"Pretty tasty" I said, "But he is just so I can forget about him" 

Colita always talks about evolution, how things aren't worth anything, yet she still heals Julia and is upset when Julia talks about parents loving them just because of genetics.

Julia laughed, she was making such a sound that you never would have known that she was depressed and suicidal.

"Julia, you have to promise me not to do anything like that again. Does your mother know?"

"She's always out at work" Julia said, "She's too busy to take care of me"

"Well next time if you feel like that, you have to tell me okay?"

"Okay" she nodded, "I will"

"So you wanted to die?"

"I thought I was dead, but somehow I woke up and was fine, like I was completely healed, I don't know why, maybe I'm just forgetting things"

"Maybe God protected you" I said, "He doesn't want you to take your life, He loves you"

"It was the only happiness I could think of" she said.

I held my honest words back. 

"You're very lucky" I said.

### Chapter Twelve - Colessa the New Girl

When we got back to homeroom, Mr. Gilbert was mad. And by mad I mean all that Mr. Gilbert was capable of was exuding a few puffs of smoke.

"Where did you girls go? Ignoring me"

"Yes!!" Julia piped up. "We love to ignore you"

Mr. Gilbert sighed and shrugged and waddled his toes, he was wearing sandals, he was always wearing sandals so we could see his toes. "Just go on and sit down" As we sat down, he went outside to retrieve something.

A new student.

Behind him was a girl slightly taller than I was, her hair was a light brown, and her skirt almost exposed her panties. Her legs were narrower than mine and her waist was smaller as well. I looked like a fatty compared to her. She waved at everyone as she walked in, the boys clapped, they were happy to see someone so hot in their class. They made whistling sounds and called out.

"So can you introduce yourself now?" Mr. Gilbert sounded as bored as ever.

"Good morning everyone" the girl spoke, her eyes twinkled around the class then rested on me. "For most of you, I haven't met you before, but my name is Colessa"

A few classmates looked at me, "Your names are similar" Julia cupped her hand around my ear and whispered. She must have been really excited to see me.

"I'm from Dunedin" she said, "And there we 

"Where is that?" one of the guys said, "Do we have a map?"

Colita smiled, "Look for it, it's spelled H, E, A, V, E, N!" she rolled her eyes as she completed the sentence and raised her hand. A few moments later the class burst out laughing when they realized what she said.

"So now I wish to become good friends with each of you" she said. "I'm excited to be here at this school."

She was an instant hit, during break time everyone swarmed around her. During lunch time everyone came to sightsee. And during after school activities she became an activity of her own. But it was mainly the girls who were interested in her, she was hot, but not attractive, a bit skanky. I don't know how the guys could tell, but I guess that when it came to women they got fussy and only chose the highest quality.

I sat at my table same as usual, but surprisingly Matt came to sit as well, he didn't ask, he just sat like he owned it. As soon as his bum hit the chair Julia became quiet and fidgety, laughing to everything he said.

It must have been awkward for her, considering that Matt and I had been together. I tried to make it as casual as possible, but Matt kept raising it. He made sure no one was around, then asked.

"So...Colita...do you want to come over tonight or something?"

"How about Lacey?" I said. "Where is she?"

"She's not feeling well" Matt said, "It's a perfect opportunity." Julia laughed.

"Uhh, no" I looked at Julia, killing her laughter. "Don't laugh, it's not funny. And Matt, that was just a one time thing, I think you should go and check up on Lacey and make sure she's okay" 

Matt groaned, "Oh come on, she's fine, she just gets moody and needy all the time. Whenever we go out she makes me hold her hand, and she always wants me to say I love her, I'm getting sick of it. I like you, you're perfect for me, we're perfect don't you think?" 

I shook my head, "No" Julia laughed again for some reason and we both stared her down. I didn't want to be too stern with her, because of...you know...her depression and all that. But she was becoming a bit annoying with her bad reading of the atmosphere.

"You're acting like you're all high and mighty" Matt said, "You made me cheat on Lacey so it's your fault if she hates me. And besides, look at your own life, it's more messed up than I am."

"I agree" I rubbed my chin, "Do you have anything else to say?" Conversation with Matt was beginning to become dull, he was a typical guy, only had sex on his mind and would do and say anything to get that, I was so over that kind of monotonous guy, no matter how old they got guys never changed. I wiped my forehead, ahh Strange Life.

"Don't you care about Lacey's feelings? You made me do something horrible to her"

"Don't blame me" I said, "It's you who betrayed her, don't point your finger at me"

Matt was upset. Julia cowered away from him. Thank goodness at that moment Nathan joined our table, with him here our conversation stopped.

Except, right behind him he had a girl with him.

"Hi Colita" Colessa smiled and waved, "Do you mind if we join you guys?" From the way Nathan and Colessa looked at each other I coudl tell that they were close. Nathan just attached himself to whichever blonde girl was the closest.

"Sure" I smiled, "I'm sure Nathan's showed you around the school quite a bit"

"He has" Colessa smiled. "He's so nice to me" I noticed that she was sitting with us without lunch.

"Aren't you eating?" Matt also noticed the same thing and pointed it out.

Colessa made a big smile and raised her shoulders. "No, it's okay, I'm kind of on a diet, I can't eat as much as you guys do"

I was eating a lot too. Colessa explained about her background, the background that the agency had made up for her. But she was so good at it that even I would have believed her had I not known that it was all fake. She was the center of attention, I don't know how she did it, but everyone was fascinated by her. Her stories were interesting, her jokes were original and funny, and she was a genuinely nice person.

She was a true angel, I was like dog poop compared to her, not worthy of qualifying as an angel. Now I knew what true power meant. As I sat there listening to Colessa talk and answer questions from everyone I had strange feelings come over me. If I said something right now I bet no one would hear me. 

"Hey, do you guys want to know where I'm from?" I said.

Nathan looked at me, "You're from Christchurch right?" he looked my way then back to Colessa, who was still speaking.

"I am, but the town I'm from is also really pretty, and there's hardly any tourists..." I stopped speaking when I realized that they were all too busy listening to Colessa. She was a master storyteller, I sucked up the last bit of my drink and put my hand under my chin to listen to her as well.

Colessa turned to Julia, "I didn't notice you in class, I'm Colessa, nice to meet you"

Julia beamed at the attention from the most popular girl. I guess Colessa unconsciously registered that Julia was no threat to her popularity.

"I'm Julia" she said, "Nice to meet you too"

After the obligatory greetings Colessa turned to me. "And you are?"

"I'm Colita" I said. "But I think you may have heard of me before"

Colessa nodded, "I have, actually I may have come to this school because of you, and Matt?"

Matt nodded, "Sure, whatever you say"

After five minutes I got bored and stood up. "Bye guys, I'm going to go and do some homework" By homework I meant sitting outside on the grass and staring into the sun, anything was better than having to listen to Colessa talk about how great she was for any longer. I asked Julia, "Do you want to come along as well?"

Julia looked at me, then back at Colessa, then back at me. She had a worried look on her face. "Sorry, maybe next time Colita?" She turned back to Colessa immediately, not wanting to miss anything. Then Colessa said something funny and they all laughed.

Julia was staying behind, she didn't know that I was the one who brought her back to life. I felt bad thinking this way, but maybe at this point in time I felt vulnerable and I just wanted a friend.

"You want some company?" Jason crossed his legs and sat next to me. "I guess even Colita feels left out every now and then" He smiled and watched me. "I care about you Colita"

"No you don't, you just want me naked, that's why all you guys hang around me."

Jason smiled, he didn't even flinch at my words, "You think you're so pretty and amazing Colita, but now there's Colessa she's who the guys care about now, not you." He stood up, looking down on me with the sun behind him, turning him into a big shadow that I could only hear. "Don't be conceited, you're old stuff we've all moved on"

"Okay, bye Jason" I rolled myself away from him. When he couldn't have sex with me he got all bitter. Now Nathan and Jason, even Matt were absorbed with this talk about Colessa. What was with guys, did they have no integrity? No matter what age they got to it was the same.
 
"You're Colita right?" I looked up and saw a girl looking at me. She was a freshman and looked a bit nervous at approaching me.

"Yeah?" I lay on the ground and looked upside down at her. "What's up?"

She looked down at me, crossing her arms and standing with her legs shut, frowning. "I need to talk to you about something, if you are Colita."

"What is it about?" I said.

She kneeled down next to me and outstretched her hand. "I believe you've been very rude to my sister" 

This girl looked at me with recognition. The type of expression an angel wears when she recognizes another of her kind.

"You were sent by Max...?" 

"No" she said. "Who's Max?"

"What's your name then?" I said.

"I'm Lacey's sister, Mel"  She stared down at me, her shyness had disappeared. "I heard you've been really horrible to my sister. 

---

### Chapter Thirteen - Colessa the Colleague

Mel and I stared at each other in intensity. She got her death glare from her sister, but unlike her sister, hers looked like she meant it. "Do you know why Lacey isn't coming to school?" she said. 

"Let me guess, because she's not the queen bee anymore?"

"You stole her boyfriend, they were best friends for such a long time until you ruined it"

"Mel" I said, still lying on the ground with my hands beneath my head and my knuckles digging into the turf. "How old are you?"

"Why should I tell you, it's none of your business"

"You're fourteen or fifteen right?" She looked young for her age. "Do you know anything about friendships?" I could see that she was like her older sister, one of the popular girls who bullied everyone around her. She was starting to show traits like Lacey was.

"I'm not sure" she said. "Some girls are really annoying, and some I can stand. There's a group of us who always help each other out and text all the time. And I'm old enough to know what sex is, and that you stole my sister's boyfriend" When I looked closely I saw features on her that were really interesting. Dark hair, light brown skin, and a really really cute look. She was glamorous for a girl of her age, even her shoes were pink. I was staring at a the newest model of 'Lacey 2'. She probably had a boyfriend and threatened the girls in her class as well.

If I was a witch, I would want to turn her into a frog. But I wasn't, I could only do good things.

"Do you not feel any regret? Don't you know that what you did was really mean? Are you a slut who goes around and has sex with everyone in school?"

"I'm pretty easy" I admitted, "I enjoy it" I didn't feel any shame or whatever it was I was supposed to feel, this was all normal for me, it was just weird in this Highschool.

"Well Lacey and me, and Mom and Dad, we're all Christians" Mel said, "Lacey and I aren't going to have sex until we get married, we're abstinent" she said the word abstinent like it was something special. "I think you should do the same"
"Don't judge me" I said, "You don't know anything about me, you just met me today and you're already telling me how I should live my life, just go and live your own"

Mel stood her ground, she was strong for a girl her age. "Well, do you even like Matt?"

"No" I said, "I just wanted some fun"

Mel stood still and stared at me, her expression unchanging, but a tear ran down her right eye, down her cheek and stopped on her chin, beside her lips. "My sister still doesn't come out of her room, it was traumatic to her"

"She deserved it" I stood up and flattened my skirt. "She was a horrible person" I turned to leave, but Mel came around and stopped me, she put her arms on my stomach. "How can you say that?" she said, "My sister's only been trying to do good to everyone that she sees, you don't know anything about her. You're mean. I want you to go and apologize to my sister."

"I won't do that" I said, "Tell her to come back to school" I pushed Mel's hand off me. Mel was taller than me, but her breasts were smaller and her curves weren't accentuated.

"She says she can never come back here. You ruined her life, she locks herself in her room all day and doesn't even answer our Mom"

A vein popped, "Mel, your sister is not a good person, she's horrible to everyone, she bullies everyone, she's not nice to be around okay? I just taught her a lesson, something she should have been told a long time ago."

"Only God can teach us lessons" Mel said, "That's not your job"

"God is too busy for us" I said, "So we have to do it for each other"

"That's not true, God loves us all"

"Mel, I like you okay, you seem like a reasonable girl, but you can't just follow your sister around all the time and support her actions. When you do that you're just as bad as her."

"No, you're an idiot" she grabbed my hair, yanking me in place to stop.

"Stop touching, get off me!" Mel gritted her teeth, she wasn't very strong but she had the temper of a wild cat. "You have to say sorry!" she said. "What you said was mean, Mom said that when you say something mean you have to say sorry."

I pushed her aside with all my strength and she fell on the ground. "You're annoying and rude, I wish you would suffer just like your older sister. The two of you are the same." 

Then, Mel burst out crying. She cried like she had been holding it in for a long time, some other girls and boys around us ran over to ask if she was alright and take care of her. Mel pointed at me as the tears gushed down her cheeks and onto the turf. "She was mean to me!"

I put my hairbands that had been ripped off back in place, and walked off without looking back. As I walked, people students stared at me, they were all wondering what just happened, if I was the bad one or her. Who could they blame, who could they tell about this? The boys stood to the side as I passed. They were afraid of me. To them I probably looked like a monster.

Would Matt find out? Nah, he was probably too busy staring at Colessa's breasts. Who knows, they might even be doing it now.

I shook the thought away, putting my hands over my ears. All these negative thoughts were appearing, I tried to push them away but they still came running towards me, relentlessly.

Walking past the stares, I felt a badness growing in me. I wished someone would stand in front of me and tell me off. I wasn't the innocent smiling girl that everyone thought I was. If they sincerely came up to me and told me that I had been extremely hurtful to Mel and Lacey and that I needed to atone, I would accept it gratefully. If they would tell me I was walking down a bad path and stop me, punish me and tell me I was wrong, then I would try to change myself.  

But no one spoke to me. I walked past the students and into the school, then through the changing rooms and into a private cubicle. I sat there and realized that no one told me it. No one cared about me enough to tell me so. A long time ago a teacher told me that parents punishing you meant they loved you. It was when they didn't say anything that you needed to worry. 

I wiped my eyes as tears were unleashed. Then, like Mel, and Lacey, and Julia, and so many other girls before me had done; I whined and cried. I was really worried now.

They left me untampered.

I heard a sound outside, a baseball bat hit a ball and clanged it through the air. Boys were yelling as they played football, the rugby team was clashing on the side field. Girls were walking around and sharing their latest gossip. But I didn't fit in, I always found myself alone, and wanting to enjoy being with others.

Then I heard footsteps outside. Tap, tap, tap, they echoed and came closer. I held my breath as the steps stopped in front of my door.

"Colita?" A female voice said. "Is that you?"

"I'm busy" I said. Whoever it was, I didn't feel like talking, I couldn't right now. My nose was runny from snot and my eyes were red from crying. I looked like a pumpkin.

"Can I come in?" the girl said. "Please?"

"Not now" I said, "We can talk later"

"I'm Colessa" she said, "From the agency"

I unlocked the door and swung it open. Colessa was standing in front of me. Her eyebrows were in a 'V' shape and she looked at me concerned, "Are you okay?" she said. "You look like you're in really bad shape"

"I'm fine, I mean there's certain things about me that I try and hide, but all in all I'm okay"

"Don't get too involved" Colessa ran her hand down my hair. "You're an angel, not a human, remember that"

How did she know that I was getting too involved, this was my first time meeting her and I was crying. I must have looked pathetic to her. We were supposed to be here for an important mission, not to resolve my crying. "Sorry" I said, "I just need a moment, then I'll be fine"

But Colessa looked down at me, peeling away the hair blocking my eyes "Do you want to talk about it?"

"I'll be fine" I wiped my eyes. Colessa gave me some space, "Talk to me about it" She was really patient and kind, and she didn't criticize me at all for wasting her time. I rubbed the bottom of my palm against my eye and forced a smile. "See, I'm fine now" I said.

Colessa wiped my eyes. "You know, Max sent me here to support you, he said one angel here wasn't enough"

"Max doesn't think very highly of me" I said, "I'm always failing missions, I'm not doing my job well, and that's why he wants me to come here, to keep me away until my contract expires"

"That's not true" Colessa said. "Max spoke to me of you very highly. He told me what you were doing and how you were making friends. When I walked into the school, yours was one of the first names I heard, and when I met you I could see that everyone really liked you, you made an impact on those you met."

"I'm not like that" I said, "I couldn't resist myself and had sex with Matt, all to hurt another girl and make myself feel better. I'm just too proud to admit it." 

Colessa grinned. "No one talks about this much, but do you know how angels evolved?"

She wasn't trying to pressure me into anything, she was really considerate, way more considerate than any guy was. She cared about my feelings and wasn't all about work. "I don't know" I said, "How did it happen?"

"The name Angels is misleading, humans who knew we could heal others gave us that name because of the extraordinary things we could do, but some scientists say that the only reason we have these powers is because we kept hurting others, so we needed to heal each other more frequently to preserve our race. So, in a sense, we're lower and baser than humans"

"So, having sex with Matt wasn't bad?" I said. 

"I don't know about that, that was pretty bad" Colessa moved in, "But it's not the worst that's happened"

"What do you mean?" 

"You're a new angel so I'm guessing you don't know it, but do you know why Max never assigns two angels on a mission, and only permits it in special situations like this one?"

I shook my head, before I knew it my tears had completely dried. Her therapy worked magic on me. Being a girl was hard, only another girl knew what this meant. Recently I felt that even if I was thirty three in actuality, being surrounded by teen girls made me the same maturity level as well, maturity was nothing but a stage of life and an environment that is habituated by a certain age group, thereby entailing packets of well processed thoughts and ideas that were expressed through the members in the detailed organization of the age group.

Colessa was leaning against the wall with one hand on my knee, the other holding the door closed, one of her legs was pressed against the opposite wall with her leg horizontal. "I'm sure you've heard of it" she said, "When angels are assigned on the same mission, then many of them tend to find an interest in each other"

"What do you mean?" I said. 
Colessa looked at me narrowly from the side of her eyes, then flicked her hair. "Many of them end up hooking up, working in close proximity with one another tends to do that for angels, its been observed by the scientists who watch our behavior. The agency knows about this and hesitates to assign more than one angel to a mission. Colessa came closer. "They say that angels have a very low volition, their self control is worth almost nothing, that's why they need to keep healing themselves to fix the mistakes they make."

Colessa was facing me now, leaning forward with her face close to me and her hands on her hips. I looked down and saw the hem of her shirt exposing the top of her breasts. She had shape shifted into an incredibly sexy figure, I hadn't even chosen a body so provocative. What was she doing? Why was she telling me these things?

I leaned forward and kissed her neck. She was warm on my lips. She moaned, "I was waiting so long to go on a mission with another angel, now it's finally come true" She touched my hair and whirled it in her finger. Then she moved over and sat on my lap, her legs falling to my left, pressing my whole body back. She touched my cheeks, then moved my head to face hers. 

I couldn't hold back, no one would know whatever we did here. Max wouldn't know either, it was our secret. I licked her lips with my tongue, then she intercepted my tongue with hers, and we started kissing, massaging each other's lips and mouth until our whole faces were covered with saliva. 

I couldn't believe it, we were actually making out with no boundaries, in the middle of the school. Hadn't she come here for the mission?

We were moaning and making sucking noises for about five minutes.

"See, this is why angels are so bad" Colessa said, "When there's more than one of us, we're just too affectionate"

I didn't want to know what Colessa did with the boys. She was looser than a halter top. But all we did was make out. Colessa made a few last kisses, then moved back and stood up, wiping her lips again. "I'm just saying, that's what we do, that's what tends to happen when two angels work together"

"Is it wrong?" I said. Colessa was one of the few other angels that I had worked with but this was the first time this happened. It felt weird, even for me.

"Is what wrong? Kissing? It's natural" Colessa poked her lips and they squished in and bounced back out. "It's a normal thing, all humans do it, so it should be normal for angels as well, it's just that most of us angels are trapped in established institutions where we have to repeat the same actions everyday in the corporation."

"But aren't there some angels who break out of it?"

Colessa grinned, her eyebrows thinned into small worms that sat over her eyes. "You mean fallen angels?"

"Yes" I said, "I would like to be one"

"You want to kiss and do all sorts of naughty things all the time with nothing to stop your pursuit of pleasure? But the agency gives us something important, it protects us from humans."

"True" I nodded, without the agency it was almost impossible for us to coexist with humans. After the agency had been established, things really started to change and the angels could vow for a possible equality that would come in the future. It was the dichotomy that we angels lived by, we all had to make our choice in life whether we wanted to be one or the other.

"It's just my thought so don't take it too seriously" Colessa said, "But I think we should all live in coherence, human's and angels, there's really no reason to split the two up into groups because the purpose of our lives is the same. We should be able to live in harmony with humans. It's just that they're afraid we will overpower them, if we have a war we are more powerful because of our healing abilities. They know that and won't let us develop."

"I agree" I looked up at her. "That would be the best solution, but it's probably not going to happen, at least not in the world we live in right now"

"The agency's been pressing it with the human governments for some time now, they're trying to advocate equality. It's beneficial for both parties" she said, "This mission relates to the global scheme. No angel's ever done this sort of mission and it feels like nonsense, but actually it might be just what is needed, I have a feeling that if we succeed, then it will be a huge step towards letting angels and humans coexist together once more."

Colessa looked at me, "But you can't do that if you want to be a fallen angel, if I'm correct, then right now we're representing not just our company but our whole race."

"But if you're right" I said, "Then that means humans have been oppressing us this whole time" I swallowed, "I don't want to believe that is true"

"We're the ones standing up for our race" Colessa said, "The dominant race can sit back and not do anything, that's the privilege of having power, you can let everything continue the way it is without change, it comes up to us to change the way things are, what is normal."

"But if we want equality, it means humans have been oppressing us this whole time" I said again. I had been around humans my whole life, I was an angel but I had talked to more humans than angels growing up.

"You are able to give everything to humans Colita" Colessa smiled and rubbed my hair, "You are someone who probably should have been born human, this war shouldn't be one for someone like you who loves humans to fight"
(Colita sleeps with humans, so is able to trust humans, do things and accept them) 

"If it's this power to heal that separates us from humans" I said, "Then I would rather throw the power away to be the same as everyone around me. I hate this power, I never asked for it. Everytime I heal someone it reminds me that I'm not human, and I feel like I've taken one step further from humanity and retreated further into the cave of darkness where the angels reside."

"That's not true" Colessa said, "You have a really pessimistic view of how things work, being an angel isn't that bad right?"

"A faint part of me wishes that when I try to heal someone, it won't work, I won't have my powers. I want to feel the helplessness and sacrifice that humans always feel, I feel like we've been missing that."

"Don't say that" Colessa said, "Now you're just insulting yourself" she leaned over to try and kiss me, maybe to stop me from confessing even more, maybe because she couldn't bear to hear it any longer. But I held my lips tight as she brushed over them.

"You need to stop being sad" Colessa said, "You're an angel, you're an amazing creature, humans want to be you"

"I'm not sad" I pushed her away gently. "It's time for class"

"You know, when I came to this school I met Julia, she was talking about you the whole time, about you this and that, she said you were really cool. So when I met you, I wasn't surprised, because I found out all about you because of her. She obviously really likes you. Max sent you here because you have a talent for the relationships and rapport between people."

"Your place and location can change everything" I said, "If you leave here and go somewhere else, then everything changes instantly. Likewise, with one word from someone, your whole perspective can change drastically. That's why sometimes I'm afraid to talk to someone, they might say something really hurtful, or they might say something really sweet. Everyone values different things, everyone needs different things"

Colessa followed me out and kept talking, "You need to develop some self confidence, you just walk away when I'm telling you how to help yourself, we just need to create an environment where we can be equal"

"We have to get to class" I said. "That's why I'm going"

Colessa was popular as soon as she walked in. The girls swarmed her, everyone wanted to be her best friend. The soccer players were sweaty, they had been playing during the break. Nathan was watching us. Jason and Matt were discussing stuff with the rest of the guys, but when the two of us walked in they all looked up.

But it wasn't me they were looking at, it was Colessa, she had overthrown my position at the top, now she was the attention grabber. I just followed her in and sat in one of the corners not to attract attention.

"You've lost your fans" Nathan turned around in his seat and addressed me with his usual smug arrogance.

"I don't care" I said.

"You want to be popular don't you?" Nathan said. "All girls want to"

"I'm not a girl" I said. Technically, angels weren't girls right? "Besides, not all girls wanted to be popular, that's a really shallow way of thinking, you shouldn't say that to a girl, it's rude you know."

Nathan raised his hands and stood back, "Jeez, I was just joking, chill okay? Is it that time of the month for you?"

I kicked him under the desk. Nathan scowled and turned back, "Colita's in a bad mood today, don't talk to her" he told the other guys, they looked at me in curiosity so I gave a fake smile back to them. Nathan was so annoying.

Jason and Matt had forgotten about me. With Colessa's arrival Matt forgot about the sex we had, and Jason forgot about his crush. Although I said I wasn't interested in them, when I lost their attention it felt bad.

That meant I was interested right?

I clenched my fists, I had to stop thinking like this, it was shallow and base.

Then Julia walked into class. I looked to her and waved, moving open a chair. I needed to talk to someone, Julia was my best friend here. Julia came up to me, she looked distracted, "You want me to sit there?" she looked around, "Sorry Colita, I'm going over there today, is that alright?" She pointed to where Colessa and half the class were. 

"It's fine" I lied, "Next time then"

She looked at me and walked on, past me. I felt like sobbing, even Julia who I had saved didn't think I was interesting or worth talking to. I watched Colessa smile and talk and make jokes, everyone loved her company, they all watched her she was the center of attention wherever she went. Was I feeling jealous? I wanted to know how  she did it? How did she command everyone's attention? What made her more interesting than me?

Class went like that, everyone had forgotten about me overnight. High school popularity ranks rose and fell like the waves on a shore, while you weren't watching the salty waves kept pounding against an aridness.

I walked out of class as soon as the bell rang, I walked down the corridor, then after I got to the end I looked back. I saw a Colita walk out with a bunch of students in tow, then Julia at the back following them out.

Was she just a lamb that followed everyone around?

"Are you feeling lonely?" Nathan walked up to me suddenly. "Colessa's grabbing all the attention"

"I'm not" I frowned, "It's none of your business anyway"

"Then what are you getting so mad for?" he said. "It's funny"

"Ugh, you're so annoying and judgmental, that's why" As soon as anything happened, they had to know about it and comment on it.

"I will still go on that date with you" he said. "You'd better give it up for me."

I stopped in my steps, "What did you just say?"

"You'd better give it up to me, like you gave it to Matt" Nathan said, "What, did I say something wrong?"

"I will NOT have sex with you, if that is what you mean" I punched my hip. Gosh he was so annoying, I wanted him out of my face.

"Don't take this the wrong way" he said, "But everyone says that you're a slut, so stop acting all self-righteous now" He came closer and tried to feel me up. As soon as everyone was gone, he became a monster.

I pushed him away, "Who's said that?"
"I can't tell you" he said, "But my lips are very itchy, they need to be kissed, if you know what I mean." He raised his eyebrows and smirked. Was he trying to be funny? This wasn't a time to be funny.

"Tell me" I said, "I'm not having sex with you, and I'm not having sex with Jason, all you guys just keep coming up to me, give me a break. Go find a girl your own age!" 

Oops, Nathan's eyes widened, "What? How old are you?"

"I mean..." I tried to save this, "You guys are acting so immature, go bother someone your own age"

"You mean Jason and I should hit on younger girls?" Nathan looked at me, "Is that what your moral mind has reasoned Colita?" 

"I mean...I mean..."

Nathan came over and wrapped his hand around my head, cuddling me. "You're cute Colita, it's you that I want, not some other girl. If you don't want to have sex with me, that's fine, but tell me at least why you did it with Matt."

"I regret it now" I said, "I never should have" My voice was muffled from talking through the fabric on his arm.

"Let me just ask you" he said. "Do you like him?"

I laughed, "Of course not, no waaaay!" I broke his grip and bent down in laughter. When he talked like I was in love with him, it was too funny. But Nathan stood aback, unmoving. 

"What's so funny?" he said. "I asked you a serious question. Do you or not?"

"I don't like him" I said. 

"Really?" He came closer, we stared at each other. He didn't break his gaze even when I looked away. "You're always around him, and you had sex with him, women only have sex with guys they like"

"You don't know anything about women" I said, I didn't back down from his gaze. This was a battle I wanted to win. There was no one else in the corridor, Nathan stared at me, how my hair fell in fronds above my eyelids and my uniform creased near the edges because of my special curves in the right places. I looked back at him with intensity, trying to see something behind his eyes, what he was hearing, and what he felt when he pressed his lips against something.

"I like him" I said.

"I knew it" Nathan said. "You do don't you?"

"I like Matt" I said. "I can't help myself, I really really like him"

"Fine" Nathan stood back, "Then I won't say anything, and I won't interfere with you anymore, I'm going to work hard to forget about you" He tried to smile, but he couldn't, he just made a half face where his lips twisted up, then fell in exhaustion.

"You're too hard to forget" he said. "It's the hardest thing I've tried to do in my life, but I'm going to do it still." he chuckled, "So you better forget about me too, alright?"

"Can we still be friends?" I said, "Or are we not allowed to see each other?"

"I don't think I can just be your friend" Nathan said. "You're much more to me than that, you're the only one I would ever consider to have sex with, I have very particular high taste in women"

I never realized Nathan had been such a great friend, I was always obsessed in my own affairs, doing things with others or smiling and talking to others, I never even really considered him...

"You're a great friend" I said, "You're the only one who will tell me when others are gossiping about me behind my back, sorry I yelled at you."

"It's alright" Nathan said. 

"But can you tell me, who said I'm a slut?"

"The rumour goes back far, I don't know who started it" he said, "But I heard it from Julia"

My world turned to stone. "Julia? Are you sure?"  

"Why do you look so surprised?" Nathan said. "Is it because she was always following you?"

"We're friends" I said. It was something I learnt recently, that if someone is very kind to you, and shows concern for you, then they are your friend. "She can't have said that" The Julia I knew always tagged along behind me, she admired me and respected me. I couldn't imagine any hostility radiating from her.

Nathan shook his head. "No, she said it, I'm sure. She's been around Colessa a lot recently"

"Julia...?"

I still couldn't believe it, that that innocent girl was spreading rumors about me. 

"No way" I laughed. "She wouldn't be able to do that"

---

### Chapter Fourteen - Colita the Actor

Spreading rumors required a precision and a level of lying that far preceded the skill set of Julia. 

"She was following you, but that doesn't necessarily mean she respects you" Nathan said. "She was probably torn somewhere between admiration for you and envy of you. SHe might have been thinking that you were so amazing and everyone was envious of you, and she, being your friend, meant that she was worth everyone being envious of her as well."

She backstabbed me, "She's sticking with Colessa now" I said. "All she cares about is her popularity, anything else doesn't matter to her." If this was true, it meant that she trashed on me and threw me away as soon as anyone better came along.
But did Colessa know about this?

"I'm going to go" Nathan said. "Good luck dealing with...this..." He looked to the side, "I'll see you around okay?"

"Okay" I waved and ran off, I had to talk to Julia. The best way to get to the bottom of this was to find out from Julia whether it was true.

I ran down the corridor to get to the art rooms. I knew that was where Colessa and her gang always hung out. But as I ran along I collected the stares of other students. They all thought I was a slut.

I don't care. I heard laughter near the music rooms and slowed down. Running looked desperate.

I rounded the corner, still panting. Five girls turned to see me, among them was Colessa, the gang leader, and beside her, standing behind everyone was Julia.

I forced a smile. "Hey" I said, "Do you mind if I talk to Julia for a second?"

Colessa gave me a warm smile, "Of course, but make sure to bring her back"

Julia looked at me, then at Colessa, her eyes were communicating upset. 

The other girls looked me down. "What are you doing here?" one of them came forward and blocked Julia off. "We were just talking"

"Did you guys spread a rumor about me?" I said. "Someone's been saying bad stuff about me behind my back, I'm just trying to figure out who it is"

"What?" They pretended not to know, "What are you talking about? Stop blaming us for your problems"

I put my hands on my waist, this had to be sorted out. "Were you guys were telling everyone I'm a slut?" I said. "I find that very offensive and rude and would like you to stop." I was talking to the three girls in front, I didn't want to get Colessa into this, but I had to confront them.

"You're so pathetic, it's real isn't it?"the girl in front said, "You're throwing yourself onto Matt and still so stuck up about it, get over yourself, you deserve it."

"You guys are just jealous" I said, "You all like Matt, every one of you, but I was the one who got him"

The girl in front rushed at me, "Youuu!" she screamed, "You're a filthy skank, staining everyone in the school, go back to the poor filthy neighborhood you came from."

Colessa held her back. "Now let's settle this in a civilized manner" she said. She had an air of purity about her, and they way she said it instantly made everyone fall silent. They respected her immensely.

"I heard that Julia said I was a slut" I said, "I don't like you talking about me like that, it ruins my reputation"

Colessa nodded and listened. Just earlier we had been talking about angels and I had been crying, now, in the second half of lunch we were talking about somethign else entirely. She heard my story and thought for a second, she looked to the girls and then back at me.

"It's true Julia wouldn't say that" Colessa said, "She had to have heard it somewhere" Julia was still standing behind, I realized that she wasn't just timid, but also afraid to confront me as well.

"Isn't it true though?" Colessa said. "You had sex with Matt during school hours, and you're still saying things like you never did it."

I looked at Colessa. So this was where the rumors had originated. I wanted to slap her, I wanted to kick her and knock some sense into her. Weren't we both angels? What was she doing?

She cocked her head and looked at me, still as calm as ever. "What do you think?" she said, "We only see your behavior" she said.

"I'm not a slut" I said quietly. I repeated it as I took a few steps away from them. "I'm not a slut" 

"I'm not an idiot" I knew who called out. I turned around to see Julia standing in front of me. As soon as I retreated she had gained courage. "I'm not an idiot" she said, "I know you're a bad influence, it would be better if you left this school." Julia looked at me with stern eyes that I had never seen her with. "Don't call me your friend anymore, I don't want my name stained by you."

I gritted my fists, scouring through this sea of girls, the five of them were full of pure hatred for me. Spreading rumors, then laughing at me when I came over. I wanted to bite back, I wanted to say something that would affect them. 

Later Colessa would come up to me and act all normal, when she needed to discuss matters about our mission. Then Julia would follow me whenever convenient. The boys would talk to me whenever they wanted sex, then call me a slut when I refused.

"Colessa" I said "You're a total stuck up fake, you've only been here three days but I already see right through you. You need attention from everyone."

The girls laughed, it was a standoff, me against the five of them. "You're the only one needing attention, look at yourself now, so shallow, can't you see you're losing?" One of the girls said.

I turned my gaze on the three girls in front. "I don't even know who you guys are, but you have the dignity to speak about me to others and pass on rumors, so I'll tell you this. You are the most pathetic dogs, just selling everything you have to be accepted, even selling those around you."

The girls were unnerved. "Is that all you have to say? You're such a fat stupid loser, you're so stupid and an idiot."

I ignored them and turned to Julia. I actually had leverage on Julia, but she didn't know it. I smiled, "I have to tell all of you a secret, actually, I'm an angel" The girls laughed, but Colessa's expression was priceless, her mouth widened in an effort to stop me. This was finally getting through to her. 

"Actually, Colessa's an angel as well" I pointed to her, "We're both here for a special mission"
The girls looked at Colessa. She was sweating, but tried to act nonchalant. "What is she talking about, she's crazy" she said.

"And Julia" I turned to her, "You've been cutting yourself every night, you're severely depressed and suicidal, but you hide it from everyone. Not even your parents know about it."

Julia tucked her arms behind her, "No, I'm not, she's lying" she said. The girls grabbed her arms and looked them up and down.

"They're no marks" The noisy one said, "You're lying"

I went on, "A few days ago she committed suicide in the bathtub. She was dead for over a day." Julia looked horrified, like even she didn't believe it.

I basked in her doubt and went up to her, a huge frown on my face, "And guess who saved you when you were dead?" I pointed a finger to myself, "Me, that's right, I used my angel powers to heal you when you were so depressed that you didn't even want to live."

Julia shook her head, "How do you know about that...Nothing happened though"

"I saved you" I pointed at her, "You owe your life to me you know, I wouldn't mind a thank you"

The girls looked at Julia, then at me. "You're lying" one of them said, "Now you're hurting Julia's feelings"

"Her feelings aren't loyal, so they will be easily wounded" I peered up at Colessa, she was trembling from fear. Even more than Julia was, that sure shut her up.

"What...are...you...saying" Colessa looked at me, trying to make me stop. "You're not an angel, right?"

Her pain was too much fun to watch, "I am" I said, "You are too, so stop lying"

Colessa gritted her teeth and moved her hand back "Please, Colita, stop, this joke has gone too far" she said. "I will slap you if you say any more"

"You're a fake" I said, "You think these girls are your friends, but they're just leeching off your popularity with the guys."

I looked at them, "You think you're all pretty, but we angels can just become anyone we like, slim and tall and blonde, and all the guys will love us. NO matter what you guys do, the guys will want us more" 

Colessa's slap hit me. It had so much force that I was flung on the ground. I think she drew blood from my lip.

"I'm sorry" she covered her ears, "But Colita, just stop, please"

The girls stared at me, then her, mesmerized. They had no idea what was happening.

"You've ruined everything" Colessa said, "Are you happy now?"

It dawned on me, I had just destroyed the mission. In my anger I had destroyed everything I had worked so hard to set up in an instant.

Colessa began weeping, her head cradled in her arms against the wall.

The girls were still staring, lost for words.

It all depended on them now.

---

### Chapter Fifteen - Colita the Deep Thinker

What I learnt was that when it came to crucial times for action, I was weak. Very weak, I had betrayed everything about the agency in the heat of the moment. Likewise, Colessa was weak as well, she couldn't say or act to help, she was sobbing uncontrollably.

But strength came from somewhere unexpected...

"Angels? Missions? What are you talking about?" 

In the aftermath of the explosion, Julia came forward.

"They were reading Shakespeare" she said, "Trying a live version act"

I sighed, anyone would know that there weren't such strange types of angels even in Shakespeare.

"Oh, right, so this is all an act?" One of the girls said, "Colessa was acting right?"

Julia put her hand on the girl's shoulder, "Sorry, we should have told you about this flash rehearsal" Julia said. "But we wanted to see your reactions"

Colessa stopped crying and wiped her eyes with her sleeve. She looked up at Julia.

"But it looked so realistic" Another girl said, "You looked like you really hated each other"

Julia came forward and made me hold hands with Colessa. "They're best friends, see?"

Colessa and I looked at each other in shock, what had just happened, had those two things seriously just followed one after the other?

The girls grinned, "Wow, that was some serious acting, you must be really dedicated to go this far." They looked at each other and started laughing. "For a second, I thought it was real" 

"Me too" said another girl. 

Soon they had all started laughing, I laughed in relief, Colessa was breathing deeply, letting loose her stress into the world.

"You're not serious right?" she said.

"Wow, just wow"

How had that been salvaged, I would never know. 

One of the girls asked, "So, the rumor about Colita?" someone said, "Is she still a slut?"

Colessa looked at me, for a second I saw the fear return to her, "No, she's not" she said, "That was my mistake"

So she had said it. But that moment had brought us together.

Through the whole thing though, Julia stared at me and Colessa with unflinching eyes. I tried to pretend I didn't see her, and then I pretended I did see her; to try and get her to stop looking.

Julia knew, and I knew that she knew.

Well, this was awkward...

"Hi Julia" I waved to her in class, she looked my way knowingly, then looked back. She knew exactly what I was thinking, I couldn't help it, people were predictable when they were tunneled into a corner, they only had a limited set of actions to apply.

No nasty rumors spread around the school, it seemed like the girls really believed what Julia said.

It meant that she had saved us. Which made it all the more awkward because she could only do that if she knew that we were angels.

And it also showed that she was a great liar. 'Great' didn't cut it, she was an excellent unflinching liar. She had lied through her teeth, improvising the whole performance, and they all believed her.

Maybe she had been the one tunneled into a corner, and reacted with a violent lie.

Anyhow, during math I raised my hand to go to the bathroom. Then immediately afterwards, Colessa raised hers.

"I can't let you two go together" the teacher said, "You're going to do your texting and head-booking."

"It's face-booking" Colessa said. The class laughed and Mr. Gilbert's face reddened.

"Fine" he said, "Just make sure to come back before the alarm rings, you girls always disappear for ages, but your grades are still excellent, I don't know what's happening to me as a teacher."

Colessa took my hand and led me away. She didn't say anything but walked fast, we went past the bathroom, past the ICT rooms on the third floor, and into the staircase in the corner that no one ever went past.

"Right" she turned around, "I'm not going to ask you to apologize, I'm not mad, but do you know what happened back there?" She stuck her chin out, "Hmm?"

"I accidentally told them" I said.

"Do you realize what you did? If people find out we're angels, our jobs are gone." Colessa said, "We won't be able to return to the angel world, and we will lose our healing powers. It's worse than being a fallen angel."   

"It's a human" I said, "It's not that bad"

"I don't want to be a human" Colessa grunted, "So don't you dare do anything like that ever again. I'm going to have to report your behavior to Max. Why did you do something like that?" 

I was going to answer but she just started talking again, "Seriously, everyone's going to find out, then our mission might fail. Remember I told you how important this was? It's about uniting the two races together again, we have a huge responsibility and you were about to throw it away carelessly"

I tried to act casual, I tried to not care, but the way she spoke was like I didn't matter, like I was just a nuisance to her perfect life. I was the one who started this mission, but she made it sound like it was hers. "I'm so sorry" I made it sound as sarcastic as I could. "Did I make you look bad? Is Max going to dislike you if he finds out?"

Colessa didn't smile, "You're so immature, get over it, this is just a stupid high school, you come and yell at me because you feel jealous? Betrayed? Who cares, there's more important things in life"

"YOU spread that rumor about me" I pointed to her, "Why'd you do that?"

"Because it's true" Colessa said, "You slept with him, us angels shouldn't be doing things that will raise suspicions, having half the school talk about you and Matt is doing exactly that"

"But YOU'RE the one spreading rumors and raising the attention of the school" I poked her stomach with my finger. "Not me" I wanted to cry, why was she acting like this, earlier today I thought she was my best friend, now she was being so mean. Didn't she care about how I felt? She was being heartless.

"Max will be very upset with us" she said, "We're arguing over nothing instead of being with Matt. You even slept with Matt"

"Why should we be with Matt?" I said. "You're jealous of me right? Because I slept with Matt and you didn't"

Colessa sighed, she grabbed my finger that was poking her and raised it to her lips. "We need to be working together, for when something does happen to Matt. So we're well prepared, Max assigned two of us, it means he thinks something's bound to happen. I can sleep with Matt any day, but unlike you, I don't want to do something that might jeopardize this mission."

I pulled my finger away, I didn't want this girl anywhere near me. She was so fake, pretending to be my friend when I felt lonely, and then gossiping as soon as I turned away. What was wrong with her? Did she have no loyalty?

"Shh, stop making that sound" Colessa said, "You need to trust me, this is just a high school, this is work okay? Don't get caught up in it, our real lives are far more important."

"I thought I could become a high schooler" I said, "Even just for a year"
"You are one" Colessa put my finger in her mouth then pulled it back out with a 'plop' sound, it was wet with her saliva dropping off it. "Everyone here wants to be you or me, it means we've succeeded. And you also felt jealousy, loneliness, hatred, anger, love." Colessa smiled, "See, you're a true high schooler"

She put my finger in her mouth again, watching me the whole time as she massaged it around her mouth, I could feel the solidness of her teeth against my finger, she rubbed her tongue against my finger and really softly, moaned. Then smiled.

"We need to bond" she said, "That will make us do a better job working together, if we're fighting over boys or girls and friends then we'll get nowhere."

"Do you want to talk?" I said, "About angels?"

Colessa shrugged, "Sure, if you want to." She sat down on the stairs, they were grey concrete steps that were off to the side of the school, so they weren't designed to be pretty, only to be used in times of emergency. Colessa rested there and untied her hairband, letting her hair flow softly down her shoulders and onto her fingertips.

"Colita?" she said, "Do you want to have sex?"

My body twitched. 

"I find you incredibly attractive" she said. 

I looked at her sitting there, invitingly. Her legs were crossed and her skirt was running up her thighs. If I just reached out...

"We're girls" I said. "The last time I checked."

"Don't worry, I'm experienced, I've done it with other angels. Think of it as fulfilling your job, to work better with your colleagues, if we get along, then we can help others get along too, don't you think?"

I shook my head. "Kissing was just...enough...for me" I backed up against the wall. "I don't want to try this"

Colessa smiled, "Do you want me to change appearance, would that make you feel safer? I could change into a boy if you like?" She put a finger to her lip, "Hmm, let me see, how about someone macho and handsome guy like George Clooney. Colita, are you into older guys?"

I shook my head, "I don't want to" I said. 

"Why not?"

"I just don't feel like it"

Colessa stood up and smoothed out her dress. "Fine, then don't ask me to do things for you anymore"

"What did you do for me?" 

"I won't mention it again, okay?" She came over beside me as we walked out. "Were you embarrassed?" she said.

"No, I just don't feel like it" I didn't want to offend her, and I was a bit afraid of her now as well. Really, she didn't seem to have any limits.

"Well, I just want you to know" Colessa said, "I'll do anything for you okay? You shouldn't be feeling left out, we're angels together, you're the most important person to me here." 

We stood and faced each other. Colita made a smile, "Come on" She took my arm, "Let's get back to class, Mr. Gilbert will wonder what's up, we've been missing for ages."

I pulled my arm loose from hers and sank to the ground, slouching on the step. "What's wrong?" Colita said.

I just stared at my fingers, how they sat on my knees, how my hand was on the rail, but unable to support me. (Use actions to express the emotions she is feeling.)

"I'm tired" I said.

"Oh, do you want to rest? I can go back and tell Mr. Gilbert what's happening"

"No" I said, "I'm tired of this, everything, why does it have to be so complicated?"

"You mean this mission?" Colessa peered at me.

"No, I mean yes" I said, "I don't want to go back to the classroom, I'm afraid of Julia, what if she doesn't like me?"

Colessa put her toilet materials back. "Oh come on, are you still talking about this?" she said. "Julia's just an innocent lamb, she can't harm anyone." 

"A lamb doesn't know it is a lamb" I said, "Everyone is a lamb without knowing it"

"Why are you in such a bad mood?" Colessa said, "Just have some fun, we're at school!" She tried to cheer me up with a gentle nudge from her knuckles, but it just pushed me over and I lay slumped on the ground. 

I went on, "Every lamb will grow up and be eaten, but they don't know it, their life purpose is to become fat and delicious for humans"

"OH come on" Colessa leaned against the wall, "Should I go back first?"

"When I turn on my light at home, it's radiance can be seen for miles and miles around, illuminating the world, decreasing the amount of darkness in the world"
"And it's just a flip of the switch right?' Colessa pulled me up, "Come on, let's go, we've heard enough of your philosophies, now let's get to class."

"Will Julia be there?" I said.

"Of course she will" Colessa groaned, "Can you seriously grow up? We're actually working right now, technically"

### Chapter Fifteen - Julia the Dictator

Julia talked to me as soon as the bell rang. She practically ran over to my desk. "So...Colita?" she had her hands resting on my table and looked up at me with her hair twisted over. "What you said earlier was true right? About you being an..."

I silenced her, putting my hand over her mouth. "No" I hissed, "But don't say that word okay?"

"So then why are you so embarrassed?" she said. "You are an angel right?"

"Yes" I said, "But please, don't say that word"

"Okay then" she said. "So you mean that this isn't your real appearance?" She pointed down my body, "All of this is fake?"

"Yeeeesss" I sighed.

"Good, I'm not jealous anymore, being surrounded by you and Colessa together really wasn't healthy for my confidence."

"I'm not that pretty in real life" I said. Then I realized this was real life for her, she looked at me quizzically, "I mean in my world, I'm not very attractive"

"Good" she said, "That makes me feel better"

I sighed, whatever she said, I didn't really want to listen to it anymore.

"I heard something interesting" she smiled, "Everyone is a lamb without knowing it"

"Did you?" I said.

"And that every lamb will be grown up to be eaten without knowing it"

I looked up at Julia, she was watching me with a proud grin. "Where did you hear that?" I said. "Were you eavesdropping on our conversation?"

"Come on, you don't have to hide, I could hear everything sooo clearly" she said.

"Julia, privacy!" I said, "That was a private conversation I was having with Colessa, you had no right to listen."

She didn't flinch, she was completely convinced that what she did wasn't wrong. "You sounded so sad and helpless" she said, "You act so different around Colessa than you do around the rest of the world, are you a vain girl?"

"I'm not" I said. "What did you want to tell me?"

She leaned over and whispered in my ear, "I recognized your sadness and was excited by it, I love to see the expression of a woman in pain, so come over to my house after school, I have something amazing to show you"

"I have to do something after school" I said. "I'm sorry"

"You will come" she creeped over and licked my ear, "I promise you will, or else people in school are going to find out about you, how you're not a human."

I stood up to get away from her, she was completely different. Now that she knew who Colessa and I were she had become courageous. This wasn't the Julia I recognized. This girl in front of me was scary and dangerous

"Just wait" Julia called out, "I'll see you tonight at my place, you don't need to knock. And don't tell Colessa, it's just you, alone."

I spent the rest of the debating whether or not to go. In history class I debated that if I went, Julia would take advantage of me further, this was blackmail. Then in Chinese class I debated about what Colessa would do. She would probably yell at Julia and threaten to do something. She might even call up Max to discuss it. 

That would be the end of my job.

Should I go and meet Julia or not, should I or not? As I kept thinking this, the last bell rang. I felt my knees shake. Jason and Nathan and Matt walked past and out the room with Colessa. She didn't even look at me, she was pulling the string of all those three guys together.

I crouched down on my desk, putting my head on its hard surface. Why did it have to be so difficult, why couldn't I just go home and have that smoke? Where were all these complications coming in from?

"I know you're a really nice person" Mr. Gilbert was standing in front of me. "Ms. Colita" he said.

I touched my hairband to make sure it was in place. "What do you mean?" I said. 

"But Lacey hasn't come to school for three days now" he looked over his notepad, flipping a few pages, "I would like you to go and visit her, I'll give you her address"

I sat up straight, this was some sort of joke right? "I'm not going to visit her" I said. "Why do I have to do it? Why not anyone else?"

Mr. Gilbert pulled up a chair, the way he sank into it suggested that he had not been sitting for a long time. "I'm sure you have your reasons" he said, "But I asked around, and they said that you and Matt..." 

I was glad he trailed off, this teacher was about my age, he was young, and looked endearing. It was belittling to have him also know about what happened.

"...And Lacey hasn't come back to school since then" he said. "What do you think?"

"Okay" I said, "Since I'm such a nice person, I'll do this for you, but please, no more houses okay?"

Mr. Gilbert stood up, putting the chair back under the desk, "Of course, thank you for being so reasonable Colita, you act like you're much older than you are, and for me as a teacher too, it makes my job easier."

Either that was an insult to my acting, or a compliment to my sincerity.

"I'll go and visit her" I said.

Mr. Gilbert stayed behind to work on some more grading. I wondered what time he would get home, and whether it would be nice to get home. Did he have a wife or kids waiting for him at home? How fulfilling was his life as a teacher.

"Bye Colita" Mr. Gilbert said.

I looked back, he was grading papers but looked up and saw me. He smiled and put his pen down. "I hope I can see you on magazine covers doing something someday, inspiring young people all over the world, once every now and then I see smart students like you come along, and I wish them along."

"Thank you" I said.

"Whatever career you choose, make sure to pursue it with all of your heart, our cities and people can really benefit from some well directed motivation."

"Thank you" I said again. I closed the door behind me quietly, leaving Mr. Gilbert to do his work in peace. I leaned against the wall in the bathroom for a while.

Mr. Gilbert really saw good in me, he really saw what I could do and wanted me to do my best. He wanted me to follow a career and do good with it, change the world. He believed I could.

So this is what it felt like to be human, to be trusted by someone, and to have someone supporting you when you felt weak, and when you weren't sure if you were going to fall. 

I touched my necklace again, playing with its texture in my hands. I knew it so well, I had grown up with it. But right now it reminded me of someplace I wasn't sure of. Home.

I walked to the school foyer towards the main gate. All of the students met up here, they talked for a while and walked back in groups. Couples who were dating left together, and other loners walked back alone. All the while, the gossip passed from mouth to mouth, from ear to ear. Filling each house with a new presence.

I saw the guys from my class, they looked excited and were talking about the latest happening. One of them saw me and waved. I waved back.

Jason and Matt were playing football right now. They were getting better and better at it. But Nathan stood at the gates, his hand leaning against the gate, and holding his backpack in his other hand. With the sun setting, his features were dyed orange. Like a flower petal losing its age. When he wore it, the uniform looked good. Better than anything I had seen in anyone. Or maybe it was just me right now.

Nathan, as if he felt it, turned to look directly at me. He didn't look past me or pretend he didn't see me, he smiled. 
In the school, Nathan was one of the first guys to approach me when I entered this school. And when I felt down or lonely, even though he was indirect and mean, he still gave me his attention. I know he cared about me, even though he only talked about sex and shallow things. It felt good to have him notice me right now.

Then the girl he was talking with also looked at me, she gave me a nod of understanding. A nod that transcended any humanly connection. She turned back to Nathan and laughed at something he said, covering her mouth with her slender hand.

It was Colessa, she was telling me not to come closer, because her prey was near. She was just about to have him latch onto her. I could hear her laughter with my eyes closed.

I walked past, this wasn't my stage to perform on; mine hadn't arrived yet.

I felt a tap on my shoulder, "Where are you going?"

I looked and saw one of the girls from my class, she had a concerned expression on her face. The sun was directly in her eyes, but not in a painful way, it was in a relaxing massage over her features. She wasn't very pretty, but the sunlight made her so.

She looked back, trading the sunlight onto her hair, then she was back again, always smiling. "We're just going to go to have dinner" she said, "Do you want to come along?"

She always saw me alone, walking around the school. I probably looked lonely to her, she was just being kind. I looked down at my hands, they were staunched orange, like a big bottle of iodine had been collapsed onto them. My uniform was also dyed the same tinge. In a matter of minutes the sun would disappear and we would be swallowed in darkness.

So we had to go. 

"I have to visit a friend" I said, "Sorry"

"It's Friday night?" she said, "Are you sure? You can come with us you know."

"Yes" I said. I tried to smile but I couldn't, it was too hard to. Instead I nodded to her and walked off. She was a sweet girl, inviting me over. If more people were like her, the world would be much better, there wouldn't be any segregation of all reasons..

I faced the sunlight and walked back, the opposite direction of where I had come this morning. The voices of students left behind me quietened.

On a Friday night like this, everyone went out and had fun, it was important to.

But one person hadn't, and I was going to visit her now. 

Julia.

### Chapter Sixteen - Colita the Angel II.

The last rays of sunlight spilt orange onto Julia's doorstep and slid onto my shoes as I glided into its presence. No lights were on in her house, only the gentle rays caressing the doorknob and reflecting through the window into a colorless house.
Her parents were out again.

"What do you want me to do Julia?" I said to myself and walked up the steps, into the ray, as it distorted and covered my hair and one of my eyes. My hands were orange, like they were burning with a sparkling gas.

The door was unlocked so I stepped in, taking my shoes off.

"Julia?"

If there was an answer, I didn't hear it. I went straight up the stairs and into her room. But her door was locked.

"Julia?" I said, "Are you in there? It's me, Colita"

Julia was a private person, I was her closest friend, but I didn't know anything about her. What she really felt, and she hadn't told me anything about slitting her wrists.

She had never thanked me either.

Her door was locked. I tried to grip the handle but it wouldn't turn.

"Julia" I said, "Are you in there?" She asked me to come, had she forgotten?

I stepped back and kicked the door open. "That's it" I said.

My mouth froze, my voice dissipated into the thick air. 

There was a rope attached to the ceiling, it was a normal rope, the kind you would find at any supermarket for $2.99 or something. Then, a stool was collapsed against the door, keeping it shut.

Above this, swinging slowly like a pendulum, from side to side, was Julia. Saliva foaming at her mouth, and looking down at the ground.

I screamed, covering my eyes, and then falling to my knees, feeling the carpet hit my other hand. I didn't want to look up, at her. 

She couldn't have done it too long ago, her body was still swinging, and her mouth was still wet. But her eyes were dry, they were tearless.

I tried to look away as I untied the rope, but I couldn't get away from Julia staring at me. I twisted the rope the wrong way and she started to circle, like a piece of chicken hanging in an asian barbecue store. I had seen many dead bodies, but this was unexpected, and someone I knew as well.

I expected her to grin and start laughing at any moment. Make fun of me for it all being a big joke. But I untied the rope and Julia's body fell to the ground with a loud thud, the house creaked as if some new object had landed in its lap.

Julia was in a weird position, so I straightened her out, putting her up to face me. There was still a red mark around her neck from the thick rope, on her wrists were big slashes that were oozing blood and dripping down to the floor.

I took my necklace and closed my eyes, focusing all of my energy. I was going to be very tired after this, it took a lot of energy to revive someone. But I had healed Julia before, so that might make it easier.

My necklace glowed, and I leaned down to kiss Julia, passing my energy into her. I put my warm lips against her cold and firm ones, my eyes against her closed eyelids. My nose beside hers. 

Slowly, something came into Julia, it flowed into Julia and exploded into every corner of her. Her fingers and eyelids twitched. But her first words weren't surprised.

Julia grinned, "You woke me up" 

"Of course" I smiled, "I was scared to see you like that"

"Did you take a photo?" she said.

"No, I just..." Why would I take a photo? Was her life a game to her? Did she not care at all?

"Well you should have taken a photo." She sat up, completely alive. "I feel younger" she said, "This treatment really is great"
"It's not a treatment..." I took a few steps back to give her space. It was unexpected how lively she looked. She didn't look depressed, she didn't even look sad. In fact, she looked like it had all gone according to her plan.

She smiled, "You wanted me to live. You chose that I should live."

"I never made that decision" I said. "I can't, I don't have that right, no one should."

Julia wants to make a performance. "Did you enjoy it?" she says, "I'm courageous right? I'm not afraid to do anything, aren't you proud of me?"

"I can't heal you again" I said, "I won't do it again, so don't ever do something like this, I love you Julia, you're a great human, don't do such silly things"

"I love myself too" Julia said. She put her hand on her heart. "But I don't love that thing in me" she looked at me, like she knew something. "You saw it too didn't you" she said, "That thing that comes into me when I am alive"

"You mean your spirit?" I said.

"I want to go without it" she said. "Do you understand?"

"No" I said, "I don't really understand humans very well, this is the first time I'm talking about anything like this"

"It's like a hot warm bowl of soup on a cold windy day" she said "Or like a warm fire heater after you wake up, and it's snowing outside. I like to have vegetables and meat and stuff in the soup, but I don't want tofu, I hate tofu, so I will take the soup without tofu. As soon as there is tofu, then I don't want it."

"Your spirit is the soup" I said, "Not the tofu"

She lost interest, "You brought my ghost back to me" she said, "You found my ghost and persuaded it to come back"

"I did no such thing, all I did was heal you."

"But isn't it amazing that you can heal me?" she said. "But can't you heal me and just bring me back? I don't need my ghost or spirit or whatever you call it, just bring me and forget 'it' "

"What do you mean?" my brows furrowed as I stared at her intently, "I gave you life, the most important thing one can give to someone else, it means that you owe your life to me" I said. "You should be grateful to me and just listen to me."

Julia shook her head, her hands were crossed and her hair moved in sticky strands. "I don't owe you anything" she said, "Don't overstep your bounds." She pointed a finger at me, one of the few fingers she had without slit marks on it. "You're not a human, you're not even close to being one, you're just a filthy angel, that's what I learnt recently. You and Colessa are just disgusting creatures pretending to be humans and pretending to fit in with us, but actually you're just fakes, stuck up monsters who think you control us by being the most popular, or the most polite or whatever, I don't really care. But don't you even think for a second that you're a human like us, and that we need you or something. You're not a human, you never will be" 

My hands sank, I let go of my necklace, "Julia, I saved you, you would be dead without me."

"You're a disgusting creature" she said, "I just wanted to show you how different you are from humans."

"What?" I said, "I thought we were best friends"

Julia looked to the mirror, inspecting herself, "What are you talking about. We were never friends? Who told you that"

Had I made a mistake? Had I brought a wrong spirit back into her by accident? Would that make her act so different?

Julia inspected the mark circling her neck, and then the marks on her wrist. She took out a bright yellow turtle neck and threw it on. "This is great" she said "I really look younger, maybe I've found something for you angels to do for us."

"I'm going to go" I said. 

"No" she took out something else from her cupboard. "Don't leave yet, I still want you here"

"No" I said. "Julia, you should think it over, what you've said to me"

"Why?" she said, "What did I say that wasn't true? What should I think about? You make me sound like I said something wrong."

"Because it hurts" I said, "I don't want to stay here"

"So you going to find some other human to look up to you?" she said. "Until they realize that you're fake as well? You may as well stay with me, since I already know you're fake." 

"I'm not fake" I said, "Stop saying that"
Julia took the turtle neck and unwound the collar and sleeves to cover her neck and wrists. "How do I look?" she said.

I made a step towards the door, trying to act casual, but I was actually becoming really afraid of Julia. She was acting so different, had I made a mistake and brought back someone completely different?

Then the doorbell rang downstairs, and a key turned in the lock. Julia didn't budge, as if she hadn't heard it, she was decorating her face with all sorts of products lined up behind the mirror.

Because she didn't care, I didn't say a word, I stood there like a piece of furniture, ignored.

Then I heard the door swing open, and the sound of shopping bags being put against the wall. 

"Julia, are you there? Help me with the shopping please." Her Mom said.

Julia responded, "Okay Mom, be there in a sec" She brushed a few more times before turning around and running past me, and downstairs. I pressed myself against the wall as she passed.

I heard her talking with her Mom downstairs, about something that happened at school, or about her coursework. Even after ten minutes Julia didn't return. Her Mom didn't know I was here.

Then I heard the kitchen start, the stove was turned on. lights were being switched on, and music began to play, some old classic. Outside, it was pitch black, all the neighbors had their curtains drawn, with just the rims of the windows lit up from the light that seeped through the corners.

I was still standing with my back against the wall, hands shivering. The sun was long gone, the rope was gone and packed neatly away into cupboard.

The house was coming alive, pans were rattling and Julia and her Mom were talking animatedly about something. I heard the microwave start, the whirring echoed through the house.

Some part of me wanted Julia to come back and introduce me to her mothers, or let me sneak out. But I didn't feel safe leaving by myself. That meant that I was admitting I was afraid of confronting.

The corridor lights were on, it flowed into Julia's room, and onto the corner of my foot, my toes were pale white. Her mother walked came up, walked past me into one of the further rooms, whistling something to herself. Then a few minutes later she went back across me, and when she got to the bottom of the stairs, turned the hall light off again. Now I was standing here and it felt even darker. 

I really should do something, go, or sneak out. 

Then the doorbell rang, Julia's Mom called to Julia to open it. "Yes, I have it Mom" Julia's footsteps sprang across the room and went to open the door. 

Then a man's voice was heard. "Wow it smells good, what is it?"

I couldn't hear the conversation, but the corridor light turned on again, heavy footsteps made their way up the stairs, then past Julia's open door. I saw her father walk past, a content but weary expression on his face, as he made his way to another room. I still stood there, unable to move, unable to make a sound. It was far too late for that.

Then he went back, dressed up, with a casual shirt, and his bag left behind in the room. He was wearing some light slippers, but the steps creaked under his weight as he stepped down them, in a rhythm.

A moment later plates started clanging, the table was being set. Julia's mother called up the stairs, "Dinner's ready, come down now"

Was she addressing me?

But then a door moved and a tall boy walked past, he was wearing pyjamaes and walking tiredly. Julia's older brother? 

I heard voices downstairs of them eating, cutlery clanging against voices, food being swallowed. 

Then halfway through the meal, I heard footsteps running up. Then the room light switched on. Julia walked past me urgently, she walked past me and went straight to her desk, opening a few drawers before reaching in and pulling something out. It was a homework diary. She flipped a few pages, finding something she liked, then turned around to go back down.

She stopped mid step and looked at me, surprised. "Oh, you're still here" she said. "You should come down and say Hi to my family or something, whatever you want to do."

I nodded, swallowing a gulp of anxiety. I wasn't a human, it was true, I didn't have a family like this, I didn't have a brother or a mother or a father. But I still had anxiety, and I still felt lonely standing here in the dark only with my toes exposed.

I leaned down, taking anything I left then started walking down the stairs. They creaked under my weight mercilessly.

"Who's that?" Julia's brother said, "Is someone upstairs?"

"A ghost" Julia's mother said, "Of course not, now eat your food"

Then I took a few more steps and they all fell silent. 

"It's my friend" Julia said, "She was just visiting"

I emerged from the corner, my hair down, my arms down, and my legs barefoot. I stood in front of their family, but I wanted to go.

"Oh, hi" Julia's mom said. Julia stared at me blankly, I couldn't tell what she was thinking, did she even care or not. "You're really pretty" Julia's mom smiled. "Julia, how come you never introduced us to her?"

Julia's father was too busy eating, her brother as well. 

"I'm Colita" I said, "A new transfer student in the school"
Julia's Mom nodded, "Good, I'm glad you and Julia are friends"

I nodded, "Well I'm going to start to get going now" I edged out towards the door.

Julia's Mom nodded, "Good, I'm glad you and Julia are friends"

Julia got up to show me out. "See you at school" she said. She was still wearing the yellow turtle neck, all scrolled up. 

"See you" I said.

I still heard the family talking after she slammed the door behind me. They were saying my name and something about me. But the conversation soon turned. They must have thought I was weird.

I walked back slowly. After reviving Julia I felt dead. I walked away from the place Julia grew up, where she became the girl she was now.

I couldn't walk back in a straight line, so I leaned against a tree and sank down, slowly. I felt regret for healing Julia. What if I had just left her there? What would her family think? 

But after I healed her, she became so cold to me. She was supposed to be my friend right? So why did I feel so hurt?

I gripped my fists, trying to stop the tears streaming down my cheeks. Why did I have to be born with this power? Why couldn't I be born as a human? This power was a curse, it made people use me, and then hate me for being different. This power gave me nothing good. It made me lonely and quiet.

I clutched my necklace, it glowed, it was trying to heal something. Whenever I slept with guys, I always healed myself afterwards, of anything they may have given me other than pleasure. The necklace thought I needed healing.

I gripped it harder and it lit up brighter. It was ironic because the necklace could heal anything, it could extend peoples' lives, even revive people. 

But it couldn't heal a saddened heart.

That was a wound that couldn't be healed. It was something that could only be healed by others.

### Chapter Seventeen - Colita the Noble

I had five missed calls from Max. When I rang him, he picked up immediately. Max was always on standby, no matter what he was doing, our performances were vital to him.

"Colita, where were you?"

"I'm a high school girl, I'm busy, I'm sorry" I said. I was stretched out on the couch, my legs relaxing. I inhaled a sharp rasp of my cigarette, letting it flow to each section of my body. 

"Are you smoking again?" he said.

"Don't worry, I will heal myself up afterwards" I said.

But the nicotine wouldn't flow to my heart, it stopped short.

"What did you do last night?" Max said. "Matt was suffering, but both you and Colessa weren't watching her."

"What?" I gasped.

"I put two of you on this mission to take care of him, I don't care if you're busy or something, but you need to watch Matt."

"I'm sorry" I said, "I didn't realize, I thought Colessa would watch him."

"She said the same, she thought you were watching him. Don't let it happen again, both of you"

"Who's targeting Matt?" I said. "What do they want him for?" All this time had passed and I still hadn't learnt the details of the mission.

"I feel very low in confidence" Max said. "But I don't know what to do to go back to normal. It's like whenever I talk to you guys or try to do a good job, then I am constantly pulling myself lower and lower.

"I do too" I said. "But you're our boss, you have to pull yourself together. Remember what I told you about everything." 

"I try to live on your advice Colita, I am trying to print it into my brain, like a black stamp. So that I don't stray from the way."

Max sighed. "I will go and visit there later this month, but up till then, make sure to watch Matt. Matt is your life, if he is gone then you are gone, if you are gone then he is gone."

"What is this mission about Max?" I said, "Colessa and I have been at this school for a while, I've been here longer, but we still don't know what we're supposed to be protecting Matt from." 

"I can't really tell you" Max said. "It's actually confidential..." 

"Well we can't do a proper job without you telling us" I said. "What do you expect us to do? Matt isn't an idiot you know, he's going to find it weird"

Max sighed. "Fine, I'll tell you, but you have to keep it between just you and Colessa. No one else, got it."

"What is it" I threw my cigarette out, "Tell me"

"Matt's a human, the genetics department just identified him as a candidate for holding angel genes. His sperm might be able to increase the progeny of our race." 

"You mean Matt's children will grow up to be angels?" I said. It was the first time I had ever heard anything like this. "Doesn't that make him really special?" I said.

"Yes, that makes him very very special, he's the most important human that we have found... in ever. Our whole history with the humans has never seen anything like Matt. He will become the bridge between our race and the humans. With him we can finally develop an equality that will suit us both."

"What do you mean?" I said.

Matt, the rich high school kid, he was super important? I had sex with him and hadn't felt anything about him, except that he was a fast mover. "Who is targeting Matt though? Why does he need our protection?"

"We're not the only ones who know about Matt, some human organizations who know Matt's potential are trying to eliminate him."

"Eliminate?" 

"They want to kill him" Max said. "It's all politics, but they don't want angels to become equals, it will weaken humans. And they're afraid angels are going to take over against humans if that happens, so they want angels to live suppressed."

"That's horrible" I said, "We angels already work the same jobs and get paid less, when we voice our opinions, as soon as people find out we are angels, then they don't care. Yet they make us work so hard and nurture them. Without us, humans wouldn't be progressing at all"

"I know how you feel" Max said, "Every angel feels the way you do, that's why we've entrusted you and Colessa with the role of protecting Matt, at all costs. He's our ticket to equality. Once we're equal, humanity can really see new progress."

I guess I shouldn't be raising the fact that Matt and I had sex to Max. Besides, he was an ex-boyfriend. It was just off the books.

But I was excited. That meant that Matt would be connecting us to each other. When Matt smiled, both sides would laugh. I guess he was supposed to be that kind of a person.

"But Max" I stopped him before we both got too excited. "I've met Matt? he isn't the type of person to care for others, he is extremely selfish. He is quiet and ignores you when you talk to him. In school, he is called the beast and everyone is afraid of him."

"That's alright" Max said, "I'm sure he is a nice person at heart. Most humans are selfish, it's the way they are born, but we angels need to lead by example to try and change them into living the right way."

"Right..." I had almost forgotten about what we were educated about in school.

"Just protect him okay? We don't know who''s going to target him, but it could be anyone, just make sure to watch out for him." Max swallowed, loudly. "I'm kinda not wanting to say this, but isn't the way to get closest to him by becoming his girlfriend? Then you might always be together."

I blushed, it was hard for someone like Max to say something so touching. I was touched by his passion for the job, but also by his honesty. "So it's alright for you if I just go with Matt?"

"It's....alright" Max said. "Stop making it difficult for me Colita, just do what you have to okay? It's for our race."

I laughed, it was amusing to make him embarrassed by these things.

"Okay, Colita, I'm going to go over there to check up on the mission okay? And then shall we discuss what's going to happen next? Maybe over a coffee"

"If I'm Matt's girlfriend, then I can't go out with you right?" I said.

"Fine, then let Colessa go out with him, she can right" 

I giggled, the way Max talked, he was so immature, it was cute how shy he was to ask me out.

"I'll see you then" I held the receiver next to my hair, "Don't push yourself too hard okay?"

"Yeah, see you Colita" Max said. "I won't, and you too"

I felt like saying 'Love you' the way we always used to. But it wouldn't be appropriate anymore. Besides, saying it would only make it more painful for me.

Max didn't put the receiver down either, we both held it like that, listening to the blankness on the other end.

I sighed and jammed it down. I stood up and did a stretch, then went to brush my teeth.

Then the phone rang again. "Yes!" I answered, "Max? Do you want to go out for coffee?"

"It's Mr. Gilbert, I was calling for Colita, is she home?" 

I tried to sound normal, "Oh, Hi Mr. Gilbert, how's it going" There was silence again, an uncomfortable type. We both didn't know what to say. I could start talking about my life, right about...now. Well, this was awkward, why was he calling.

"Hi, sorry Colita to call you so late at night" Mr. Gilbert said. I noticed that his voice sounded tired, and breathy. He had probably been marking papers all night.

I suddenly remembered, "Sorry Mr. Gilbert, I forgot to visit Lacey's house, I will do it tomorrow, I promise!"

"I was just about to ask about that" Mr. Gilbert said. "The problem is that if Lacey doesn't come to school tomorrow, then she's going to fail for the whole semester"

"...So are you saying she's already skipped so many days of school?" 

"Yes, I'm sorry to bother you with this. It's just that someone needs to go and tell her today, tomorrow is too late."

"Can't you just change the records to say she came to school?"

"I can't do that Colita, that's illegal as a teacher, I'm supposed to set an example to you guys"

"Well do I have to go alone?" 

There was a sigh on the other end, "Okay, I will go to your house, I know your address from the records, and we'll go and talk to Lacey's parents together. I'll call them right now to let them know we are going there" he said. "We have to make sure to let them know"

"Okay" I was surprised by how organized he was. It seemed like he had everything under control.

A car pulled up on my driveway, it was an old grey car, but Mr. Gilbert took care of it. He tried to smile when I opened the door, but he had bags under his eyes. He looked around, "If anyone sees us, they're going to think something weird. Are your parents okay with this?"

"They're fine with it" I said.

His car was old, so old that it was bumpy like we were going over speed bumps every meter. We turned down a few roads and came past big modern houses. They had lights that completely terraced everything.

"I've been to her place once before" Mr. Gilbert said, "Lacey was in trouble for something else. She's not a bad girl, she just has her troubles every now and then."

Lacey's house had a huge driveway. We came to a big black gate that sealed the house off from the rest of the houses. Her place was beyond the richest. Mr. Gilbert pressed the voice button and announced that he had arrived.

"Mr. Gilbert?" I heard a girl's voice, then it cut. Momentarily, the gates began to swing open, revealing a garden that looked like Eden in front of us.

Mr. Gilbert looked at me nervously, "Are you sure you're okay?" he said, "I actually brought you all the way here to apologize to her, do you think you can do that?"

"Mr. Gilbert! I don't want to apologize to her." 

"What you did in school, that could be considered traumatizing for her"

We drove past trees and flowers, the grass slid past like a scar on the ground. He started speaking as if he was remembering the past. "Recently I like to think back on when I first started as a teacher, I taught the younger kids" he said. "There was a girl who was really sweet, she gave out the handouts to everyone in class and made sure to greet them. I never heard her say a swear word."

"Really? Who was that?" I said.

"I always let them play games instead of go and study, I held them back. I always hoped it paid off. I thought of it as character development. And after a while, these kids really became good people. That really sweet girl, her name was Lacey. She was just this tiny back then." He put his hand down to show me how small she was.

I knew what he was saying, and I knew he wasn't planning this, or criticizing me for anything. The way he said it made me agree with him, I didn't feel offended, but supportive of him. Perhaps that was the quality of a good teacher.

He was saying that she was a human, just like everyone else. But a lot of the time we forget that others are humans as well. But when we see someone's insecurities, or faults, then we see how they are really affected by their surroundings, and it is these interactions that form a person.

"Okay" I said, "I will try" 

Mr. Gilbert looked at me for a second before turning back to watch the road. "You will do what? Did I say something?"

"Never mind" I said.

We finally saw the house, after driving for ten minutes down the driveway. I looked through the back window and couldn't even see the gate we came in from. Just how big was this place? What did her parents do? I swear even professional Hollywood stars couldn't afford anything this big.

When we got to the house, the front door opened as Mr. Gilbert and I got out. A tall pretty blonde lady was standing with two dogs on leashes running around and barking. She was cuddling a anorexic-looking poodle in her hands. Her fingernails were painted sparkling purple.

"Hello, you must be Lacey's teacher" she said, "Daniel Gilbert"

Mr. Gilbert smiled, "Thank you for letting us see Lacey on such short notice Mrs. Triangle"

"That's alright" she smiled, petting her Poodle. When she focused her attention on her poodle, the other dogs ran out, but when she pulled them back, the poodle started begging for attention. It was a hard position she stood in. "As long as my baby girl gets better, she's been suffering so much recently. It's unbelievable, what the other girls at school did to her."

She turned to look at me, her perfect red lips pouting into a sip. "Who is this?" Her eyes slowly widened, syncopated with time. 

"This is Colita" Mr. Gilbert stepped aside to allow her to make a full inspection of me. "She has come here very nobly, to apologize to your daughter."

I heard running down the stairs, then a moment later a girl called out "Mom, there's no more Nutri-Grain"

Lacey's mother made another double-take over her shoulder, then rushed off to take care of it. Mr. Gilbert took his shoes off and entered, I followed and did the same.

I heard things being shuffled around in the kitchen, then cereal being emptied out into a bowl. Mel walked past us with a full bowl of cereal, she looked at me and Mr. Gilbert, then stuck her tongue out at me and went up the stairs two at a time. 

I stood there timidly, not knowing what to do. Thankfully Lacey's Mom came back. Her eyes were set on me. "You're the girl who hurt Lacey's feelings, if you're not going to apologize then I would like you to leave" she pointed out towards the gate. "We don't tolerate rudeness here" she said. "You should be thankful my husband isn't home, he was even more upset than I was"

Mr. Gilbert stepped between us, "We can have a chat about it while Colita goes up and apologizes"

She looked at me, her hair was perfectly blonde and straightened like the hair on her dogs. "Who's Colita? Are you a latino?" she said. "Is that why you're so rude?"

"Don't say that about other races" Mr. Gilbert really stepped between us, "All of the races are the same Mrs. Triangle. Can I let Colita go upstairs now?" He looked at me, I nodded approvingly, the shorter the time spent here, the better. 

But Mrs. Triangle held me back, she pulled the corner of my shirt with her sharp fingernails, almost ripping it. I looked at her, she stared at me with sharp eyelashes that were heavier than anything. "You really hurt my baby daughter" she said. "She has never felt that kind of pain before, her whole personality changed, what if she is unable to function properly as an adult because of the traumatic experience you endowed on her?

I shrugged, "I'll go and apologize"

"Right" she nodded, "You'd better, and if she doesn't heal up properly, or if there is anything slightly wrong with her, even the tiniest hint of something being off, then I'm going to sue you, and we're not going to stop there. We're going to pull you out of school and have it known around the country. What you did was horrible."

I walked up the stairs, walking past some loud music from a room. I looked in and saw Mel focused on her computer screen, some music video was playing with skinny and pretty white girls singing seductively about something. She was licking the spoon of her cereal. 

She felt my presence and suddenly turned her head to look at me. I tried to look away but it was too late, she had caught me.

"Stalker" she called out after me. "Go and say sorry to Lacey you loser!"

I walked on, going to the next room. It was a big room, the door was open. It was Lacey's parent's room. The bed had a huge roof over it, like the ones in the movies where royalty slept.

The next room was the bathroom, I opened the door and was blown away by the smell of perfume and loveliness. If I put my Barbie in that bathroom, it would disintegrate from all the strong smells. The shower was still wet, and the curtain was drawn back haphazardly. Everything was sparkling white.

I closed the door and went further down the corridor. I walked and walked, this corridor was really long, even after turning a few corners I still couldn't see the end. 

Then I started to hear sounds. It sounded like a woman yelling something. I walked closer to it, then noticed it wasn't yelling, it was breathing, moaning.

"Matt, harder, please, harder" she said. "Oh, I'm so glad you're back with me"

I stood in front of the door. People were having fun inside. As I kept listening to the moaning I knew it was Lacey. She knew I was here and she was putting on a performance. But what was I supposed to do? Was I to go back to Lacey's Mom and tell her that I couldn't go in and apologize because Lacey was having sex with the guy I had slept with?

She was getting my leftovers, but why was Matt doing this? I thought he liked me? Or Colessa? Hadn't he already given up on Lacey? Did he have no honesty, one moment he was with me, then he switched whenever he felt like it. 

Men were the worst. 

I hated Lacey even more now. She was the worst person. I never knew I could get so angry at a high school girl, but she was pushing all of my buttons.

I stood there indecisively. To not go in meant that I would be backing off, but if I went in it was weird as well.

Did Matt not like me anymore? Was I not pretty enough for him? Was that why he was cheating?

I bashed the door open, I didn't care anymore. Lacey was stark naked and sprawled on the bed, her legs wide open, Matt was sliding in and out like a well-oiled machine. There was no friction, it was smooth. With every slide, Lacey gave out a well toned cry of pleasure. Lacey saw me out of the corner of her eye, Matt turned around and stopped for a second. He pulled out and let the liquid on his tool drip onto the carpet.

"Not the carpet!" Lacey cried, she covered him with herself and turned to me. "So, Colita" she said, "Sorry about this, I never expected it to take this long, I heard you came to...apologize?" She flung back her hair while she savoured in the pleasure.

"Matt?" I said, "What are you doing?" Matt turned his head, his neck was muscular, and his arms were holding Lacey's small body against him, protecting her. He tried to pull out but Lacey forbid it. "Go on" she said, "Don't stop now, keep going. This is what I saw, let her see the same."

My mouth dropped, my knees felt weak, I wanted to throw up. I had barged in expecting them to stop, expecting them to feel guilty and stop, but none of that was happening. Matt just went on like a blind and deaf animal purely focused on his feed. Lacey was smirking in my face. I was powerless against her.

"Sorry....Colita..." Lacey managed to say, "Matt likes me more" She caressed his short hair as he grunted in pleasure, still thrusting in and out, in and out like a robot on a factory line. "Don't you Matt?"

"Yeah" he said, he kept moving, his butt muscles clenching like a Greek god's.

I turned around to leave. This was too much, even I had anticipated this. I would leave them to it, let them make the baby.

"Uh, uh...no" Lacey said. "You can't leave yet"

I slowly turned around. Lacey was still moaning and thrashing around, entranced in a dance, her head swaying and her arms holding Matt's waist. He was moving in big movements now, penetrating every inch of Lacey.

"That's...It!" she said, "Go deep...in me, good boy"

Matt just kept grunting. To him a girl was a girl. 

"Matt's mine now" Lacey said. She was holding herself back from smiling, but she couldn't help herself and a huge grin spread across her face, widening into a laugh. 

It was scary to see how much pleasure she was getting from this. 

"Matt loves me" she said, "Not you, you slut!" She kept panting and moving her hips against him in rhythm.

I turned to leave, but Lacey called out to me again. "Colita" I looked back again and she was smiling so much now, her face had widened into a monster, her teeth looks like fangs, and her eyes were pupil-less. "You came here to apologize right?" she said, "You can't leave without apologizing"

She was enjoying this, relishing in every moment.

"You're sick" I said. I didn't want to cry in front of her, but I had never felt anything like this before, she was sick, she had planned all of this knowing that I was coming. 

Lacey had her eyes closed, Matt was close to coming, his thrusts had become slow and calculated, for maximum pleasure.
"You're supposed to apologize, not insult me, you can't hurt my feelings any more" she said. "You're not allowed to anymore, because I said so. So I want you to kneel down on the ground, put your head on the floor and say sorry to me properly, loudly."

I turned to leave, there was no way I was going to do that.

"If you leave" she said, "I will make everyone in the school hate you, and wherever you go next."

Matt looked at me, but not in sympathy, he was drowned in pleasure. "You're so tight baby" he said, "I missed you so much" He rubbed his hands against her breasts, pinching them and making her moan.

"That's a good boy, you know how to pleasure me don't you"

I couldn't make any expressions, it was beyond communicating my emotions, they didn't care what I thought. If I cried I lost. But I couldn't feel pity for Lacey, only a strong intense dislike.

"You're sick, you're disgusting" I said.

"What was that?" she said, "That wasn't an apology"

I shook my head, "You're the sickest most messed up girl I've ever known" I said.

She moaned as Matt started to get desperate and move faster again. "I'm coming" he said. 

"wait a bit" she pulled on his balls, "Don't let it go yet"

"You're so warm, and your breasts are bouncy" he played with her nipples a little bit more.

Lacey turned to me, "Well? Are you going to apologize, or do you want your life ruined?"

I sank to the ground, my knees hitting the carpet, wet with some of their juices. I looked at the carpet, I could only see the shadows of the two of them moving in motion, I didn't dare look up at them.

My arms moved forward, stretching out underneath me, then I cradled them beneath my head, resting on them. My knees were bent under me, like a geisha praising her master.

I looked at the carpet, silently. Their shadows were still moving, just when I thought they didn't know I was still there, Matt spoke to me for the first time. 

"Well? Are you going to say it or not?" he said, "You've already hurt her enough"

Matt...he was the reason for our conflict, but he didn't care at all.

Their shadows started moving faster, Lacey started to moan louder, "I'm coming!" she said. "Quickly Colita, if I cum then it's too late, I might not forgive you at all then"

I tried to make out the words but it was hard, saying them meant that I had really lost this. That I was giving in to her.

"Ah, ah ah, you beast" Lacey said. Matt was also groaning, they were both close.

"Hurry up b****" Matt said, "Hurry and apologize, I can't hold it anymore"

"I'm sorry" I said, quietly

"What was that?" Matt said.

"I'm sorry! I'm sorry for everything" 

Matt was ruthless, "Who are you apologizing to? Is this a joke to you? Lacey's feelings were really hurt, do you think this is funny?" He was pumping into Lacey desperately, their juices mixed and slid down his legs, onto the carpet. I coudl still see their shadows intertwined, moving close then far, close then far.

"I'm sorry...Lacey" I said, "For all the trouble I caused you"

Lacey screamed as she came, wave after wave, Matt left it in as she squirted inside her. They hugged each other as Lacey's breathing calmed down eventually.

"That was great" Lacey said. "Really really good, you're amazing"

Matt grinned.

Then Lacey turned to me, still kneeling down on the floor, prostrated. "You can go now" she said, "I've seen enough of you"

When I got downstairs, Mrs. Triangle looked at me with anger in her eyes, "Did you apologize or not?" she said, "Did you make Lacey feel better?"

I didn't know if she knew that Matt was there or not, but I didn't care anymore. I didn't answer her and walked out. Mr. Gilbert called out after me.

"Sorry Mrs. triangle, we will be heading off now" he said. "I will try to the best of my ability so Lacey will not experience anything like that again."
The door slammed shut behind us. I didn't say anything until we got back in Mr. Gilbert's car.

"Was it hard?" he said, "Did she still get angry at you?"

"No" I shook my head. I felt like anything I said wouldn't justify it. "It just made me really uncomfortable"

"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you want to talk about it?"

"I don't know why" I said, "It just made me really uncomfortable"

As soon as he turned the engine on, I realized I left my wallet behind...in Lacey's room.

"You're going to go back and get it?" Mr. Gilbert said. "Do you want me to go for you, it might be awkward for you right?"

He was so kind, but I had to do this myself. I knocked on the door, Mel opened the door and walked away. I ran upstairs through their giant house. Lacey's Mom was watching TV on the first floor, it was really loud, it sounded like America's next top Model, or 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' which was ironic because this family were already millionaires.
I ran to Lacey's room, praying that she wouldn't humiliate me any more. I would just get the wallet and run out.
I knocked on her door, when there was no answer I ran in, the room was empty. Matt and Lacey weren't there. I heard the shower running.
I took the wallet and went to leave.

Then, on the desk, I saw a diary. Lacey's diary, with strings across it, and childish handwriting saying "DO NOT READ!!! EVER!!!"

I stood there for a few seconds, still panicking that she might come in any moment.

I decided that enough harm had already been done, to both of us. I closed the door quietly behind me and ran downstairs. It was actually like running laps around the track, the house was so big. I didn't run into anyone because the house was so big. Then I just went on and on, out past the sound of the TV, then out the front door and straight into Mr. Gilbert's car.

"Wow that was fast" he looked back and started backing out of the driveway.

"Turn around" I said, "This driveway's long remember?"

"That's right" he looked back forward and did a big U-turn. As we drove out, he asked how my parents would be feeling about me being out this late.

"It's still ten" I said, "They won't mind"

Mr. Gilbert looked at me curiously. "When do you study then?"

"I don't" I said.

He looked at me

"I'm just joking, as soon as I get back home"
"Good" he said. "Thank you for today, it really helped solve a lot of problems that you were mature enough to apologize, I know it was hard for you, and I don't know much about girl problems, but I think you really learnt a lot from this experience. I'm your teacher and even I learnt a lot from it. It's always hard to deal with students in their homes. The parents are always out to attack you, no matter what you say."

He drove and drove, towards my house. "I'll get you home soon, don't want your parents to worry" he said.

"It's fine" I smiled. He really was kind. The best kind of teacher to have. He cared about his students and tried to be fair. 

"Mr. Gilbert?" I said.

"Yes Colita?" He looked up onto the road, the street lamps kept zooming past us, terracing the car and Mr. Gilbert and my face, travelling horizontally over us.

"You're a really good teacher" I said.

He sighed, "No I'm not, there are many better teachers than me out there. I'm just trying to do the best I can. Sorting out this kind of issue is one of the most important things I can do as a teacher." He looked at me, "Anyway, I probably shouldn't be talking to you about this, it's more business stuff. How come you suddenly asked me that?"

"Because you are kind and try your best, I trust your opinion" I said. 

"What's bothering you, we can talk about it" we stopped at a traffic light. It became yellow just as we got to it, so we would be here a while. There were no other cars around in this part of the suburbs at night. And Mr. Gilbert wasn't taking the motorway.

"Do you treat me nice because you have to as a teacher? Or is it because you needed my help with Lacey?"

He sighed. "Colita, every student I take care of, I try to see how they are unique. Every one of my students is very important, they will grow up to represent the society we live in. Everyone whether student or not deserves to be treated right. That's why I heard Lacey was needing help, and I wanted you to settle your conflict, rather than Lacey getting suspended from school and failing her classes."

"Everyone's helping Lacey out all the time, they're talking about her, and everyone cares about her. Am I pretty enough for you to care about me? Or will you forget about me as well?"

He sighed, "Don't worry about that stuff, girls your age always do, but you're all very special and unique, but if you keep comparing yourself to other girls you're never going to be satisfied." (He's clueless)

"But she's really made me upset" I said, "Is that because I'm just not as good as she is?"

"You can work your whole life at something, but someone else can come along and with one instant make your whole life work meaningless. Trust me, I know. Because they have more personality and are more natural everythign works better for them; but that doesn't mean that you are worth any less. You are still you."
I turned in my seat, the traffic light changed and we moved on, turning right. Mr. Gilbert turned the indicator on three seconds beforehand and left it flashing one second after the turn as well. 

"I loved someone so much, then they are destroyed easily and meaninglessly by someone I dislike, and they didn't even try." I said, "What do you think that means?"

Mr. Gilbert looked up, then back at the road, "Hmm, let me think. Something you cherish...it brings memories...then was destroyed by a person who means nothing and is annoying. I'm not going to say that I don't know what you mean...but..."(Mr. Gilbert basically answers the same way, he only has one way of saying things, and repeats it over and over. (Simple man?))

"Maybe it's because you're wanting too much" he said, "That's why anything you realize you don't have feels like it's damaging you"

"So how do you fix that?" I said

"I don't know" he laughed, "Gosh, I'm just a high school teacher alright? I bet smart and important professors spend their whole life researching this kind of thing, but I'm just a math teacher, sorry I don't know anything really helpful."

"But am I valuable?" I said.

He looked over at me. "Of course you are, what are you thinking?"

"Then how come my friends don't even care about me, what if they don't care?"

"So?" he said, "It doesn't matter, because you are still you, it's all in your mind, but you are still you, no matter what anyone else does, no matter what they think."

"Then even if I do something right, it's still all in the mind right?"

Mr. Gilbert shrugged, "I guess so" He circled the handlebar to the left and we swerved into a bigger street with shops on the side.

"We'll be at your place soon" he said.

"How can I have friends that will really care about me?" I said. "And not just pretend to"

"Um..maybe you should try and do something for them" he said, "Like something kind that they will enjoy"

"They're all having sex, and girls are giving blowjobs" she said. 

Mr. Gilbert lost balance of the car, it suddenly skidded to the side before he regained control and went back. His driving had suddenly become reckless and wobbly, he took a few deep breaths and his driving recovered. "What did you say?" he said, "I'm your teacher okay? I'm pretty open to talk about all sorts of stuff with my students but I don't wish to hear about what you do with boys." He paused, "Don't even mention that word" he said, "Because I will get excited, I'm a man, whether I like it or not."

"Don't even mention that word" he said, "Because I will get excited, I'm a man"

"Sorry" I said. "Lacey doesn't care about me, and Matt doesn't either, I thought I was over them, but it hurt a lot. Lacey was horrible to me, she didn't say anything nice."

"I'll talk to you about anything" he said, "But just constructive stuff, clean stuff okay? I don't want to get into the nitty gritty details of other students. Is there a brighter topic?"

"Do you like blowjobs?"

The car swerved slightly, but only a tiny bit. Mr. Gilbert sighed, "What is wrong with you?"

"I was just asking" 

"That's an inappropriate question, I'm your teacher" he said. "I said not to talk about it" He slanted his eyes over at me, looking down my body, then back to the road.

"How far away was your place again?"

"I don't know, close" I said.

"You sure you've got all your things?" he said.

"Yeah." 

"Sorry, but I don't want to talk about your private life, or mine, the sexual stuff is off limits. We can talk about anything else though."

"Well" I said, "How about something a bit big, like world peace? I feel like I can trust you on it, one of the few people I can trust."

He looked over me again, then back at the road "Colita, if you want an equal world, you can't go around sleeping with random guys, it's not good. I'm criticizing you right now. You need to have some morals to live up to, some pathway that you will follow."

"I want some people to like me" I said, "Just some is enough"

He looked over again, then back at the road. "One more turn to your place if I'm not mistaken" A few seconds later we were stopped in front of my place.

"Say hi to your parents from me" he smiled. "Tell them you're a great girl"

"Do you want a blowjob?" I said, "I mean, I don't mind giving you one"

His smile froze on his face. "No" he said, "You should get home, thanks for your cooperation today."

I looked at him a bit longer, then shrugged. "Fine" I picked up my bag and started up the stairs.

"Wait!" Mr. Gilbert said. "Colita"

I turned, he was sitting in the car, in the driving seat, he sighed, dropping his shoulders and frowned, shaking his head. "I'll take it...come here."

"Sure" I shrugged. "But you know you will lose your job if anyone finds out, I'm also underage, so you're putting yourself at risk."

"Then I won't do it" he said. 

"But you want it right?" (Show how he can't resist)

"And you won't tell anyone?"

"No, why would I?"

"Let's drive away" he said. "Not right in front of your house.

I got in the car and closed the door behind me. I reached over to unzip his pants.

"Let me drive away first" he started the car, but then a minute later turned the engine off after I swallowed him a couple of times

He reached over and turned on some rock music, he told me it was a song by The Pixies called "This Monkey's Gone to Heaven" 

The creature in the sky

As I stroked him, he groaned, just like Matt did. "You are so good. Wow" His penis inched slowly bigger and bigger towards my face, I moved my mouth up and down, trying to give him as much pleasure as I could make.

Got sucked in a hole

My teacher shoved his tool in my face, he put a hand on my head and gently nudged me towards him.

Now there's a hole in the sky

I had left the house lights on as an anti-burglary. The light that escaped the edges of the curtains shone down onto the car, lighting up my gaping mouth, and his disgusting genitals bare like a spotlight, leaving the rest of our bodies in the dark.


And the ground's not cold

"Should we move out of the way?" he said, "Your parents might see us"

     
And if the ground's not cold

"It's fine" I said. "Do you like this?"

He moaned.

"You're a good teacher, a good person" I said.

Everything is gonna burn

He pet my head, "You're a terrible girl" he said. "Who raised you to do things like this to your teacher? I should be embarrassed as a teacher. After this I can never be a normal teacher again, I'm enjoying this too much I'm breaking. I hate you Colita."

"But you're don't, you're enjoying it."

We'll all take turns

"I should be" he said "This is bad, you're being very bad right now, we should stop"

I'll get mine, too

"Should I?" I said.

This monkey's gone to heaven

"You HS girls, are you all like this?" 

Then I felt sad, to him I was just another High school girl. I wasn't anybody else. I wasn't Colita. I pumped him a little harder, already getting bored of him.

If man is 5

He succumbed to the pleasure, a few seconds later he let loose inside my mouth. I wiped my mouth and stood up. 

But I was glad to be able to control him.

Then the devil is 6

"Don't tell anyone okay?" he said, pulling his pants back up "Colita, please, don't tell anyone, if you do my life will be over"

Then god is 7

I was upset, "Why do you think I'm going to tell anyone? I did it for you okay? Did you enjoy it?"

This monkey's gone to heaven

He looked up to my windows, "Are you sure your parents didn't see us?"

This monkey's gone to heaven

"They didn't okay?"

This monkey's gone to heaven

He sighed in relief. "I feel so bad for doing that, please please don't tell anyone, I've got my job and my family on the line."

This monkey's gone to heaven

"I won't" I walked away. He was no different to all the other guys. I wasn't valuable to him.

This monkey's gone to heaven

The music was turned off.

He was gone by the time I got the door unlocked.

### Chapter Eighteen

_Guys, I am ashamed I wrote that last chapter, I don't know what got into me, I thought it was disgusting, but somehow had to do it. Sigh! I don't know what I'm doing...
Anyway, I'll try to bring things around to make sense, because my life's been a bit scattered and I've been doing this and that and living here and there, so I kind of lost the plot of the story_

I felt really depressed today, I looked at my cereal and wanted to yell at it. I looked at my uniform and wanted to tear it apart. I looked at my reflection in the mirror and wanted to cry. Nothing was exciting me anymore, really. 

Sounded like I was becoming a teenager...again.

I wasn't excited by anything much. I had lost all hope in the world since last night. Julia hated me, and so did Lacey. Matt probably did as well. And Mr. Gilbert probably did as well.

I sat on the toilet, letting my inside water gush out. What I swallowed last night was probably also coming out. My body didn't like it, it thought it was fish.

Poor kidneys.

I looked down in the bowl, I felt like the stuff in it. I was no good, no good at anything.

I flushed, put on my underwear and held my necklace with both hands. I closed my eyes, earnestly praying. Hopefully this time, it might heal my sadness.

I kissed it and it started to glow. Then I held it in both hands (Draw this scene) Then I let it flow into me. My insides healed, my mouth felt better, and I felt a bit cleaner.

Recently I was doing this a lot more than I was supposed to. It was wearing me out.

"OCD" I smiled into the mirror, making sure that my teeth showed, and no sign of my weariness, my weakness, my insecurity, and my uselessness would show.

"I am Colita, a sophomore student, and I love my friends, I am kind to everyone, and I see the best in everyone."

I put on my uniform, had breakfast, then was out the door. I was getting better and better at faking it. No one knew how I really felt.

I wondered how honest everyone else around me was. Were they also faking it, or were they living normally. If I felt this strongly about faking, then surely I wasn't the only one? How honest are we about our life? How much of it do we mention to others?  And how much is kept to ourselves privately?

Mr. Gilbert barely looked at me as I walked in. He gave me his greetings, then he went back to his book and avoided me.

Julia came into school in her usual way, quietly, before I realized it she was sitting next to me in her seat and was already falling asleep. It looked like she had been there for a long time already. 

Then Colessa walked in, she was trying not to draw attention as usual. But as soon as she stepped in, every kid's head turned towards her. The boy in front of me was turning red.

"Oh come on, you're just looking at her" But then I noticed that even Jason and Nathan were staring at her. 

I turned and Colessa had her shirt tied up, so her midriff was showing. She glanced around at the faces and smiled proudly.

Mr. Gilbert looked up, looked at Colessa dressing inappropriately, then at me, then went back to his book.

I leaned back as Colessa walked past. "What are you talking about? You mean this?" She was talking to the boys, "You need to stop looking at me okay?"

She sat down and shooed off the glances from the guys. What was she thinking, she was attracting too much attention, we were supposed to just be incognito angels.

"You're jealous, you're still jealous" Nathan came over and sat in the free seat in front of me. "She's still getting all the attention"

"I'm not jealous" I looked him in the eyes, "I don't like it when you say that"

"I heard what happened" Nathan said, "Last night, you and Mr. Gilbert went to Lacey's place right?"

I swallowed, Mr. Gilbert heard his name with mine and looked up, directing his gaze across the room at us.

"I heard Lacey was 'busy' with Matt, and you just walked in on her without even knocking"

I sighed in relief. So they didn't know, it hadn't spread around the school. Mr. Gilbert also looked back down to his book.

"Even when you apologized, you still annoyed her" he laughed. "You two are like deadly enemies, even why you try to do good you still fail"

"Is it that funny?" I looked at Colessa and wondered how she got along with Lacey. The two of them were like gunpowder and fireworks. Colessa was more popular than I was, the two were bound to blow up when they met.

Then there was a knock on the door and a blonde lady came in. She had perfect hair and a low cut shirt that showed the top of her boobs. Her boobs looked fake, and her high heels made a loud noise as she made her way across the room.

Mr. Gilbert looked up, he looked sooo guilty.

"Mrs. Triangle" he said, reaching out to shake hands. "Nice to meet you"

Mrs. Triangle didn't shake his hand, instead she looked around the classroom, wearing a sour expression the whole time. Her eyes stopped on me, and everyone looked at both of us.

"You're the problem student" she said. "I've come here to make sure Lacey's not going to be made fun of anymore"

She leaned towards me, her butt sticking out towards the wall. Her figure was like Beyonce. She was tiny, but her attitude skyrocketed.

She looked around, the nodded in acceptance and walked out with her head held high. She made sure to wave to Matt on her way out. He waved back glumly.
Then when we thought she was gone, she came back in, walking straight to Colessa. "What are you wearing?"

"Uhh...My uniform?" Colessa was lying with her head on the desk. "What do you think?"

"WHAT are you wearing???" Mrs. Triangle said again. "You're at school you know"

"Do you know what your daughter wears to school?" Colessa said.

"Your top is too low, and your skirt should be longer, pull it down please" She stared at Colessa's bare midriff in dissatisfaction, her lips twirled. "And cover your stomach, not everyone wants to see what you had for breakfast"

"Well I didn't have breakfast!" Colessa banged the table and stood up. Then she looked around at the shocked class. No one had ever seen Colessa get upset, over anything.

She frowned and sat back down, untying her shirt. "There, are you happy now?"

Mrs. Triangle was happy, "Don't you give me attitude" She looked over our heads, "Mr. Gilbert, you need to keep these girls under control"

"Yes, yes" Mr. Gilbert came over and nodded, telling Colessa the same thing.

After she had left, everyone went back to their usual habits, Colessa tied her shirt back up again, showing off her stomach.

If my Mom had worn something so revealing like Mrs. Triangle had, I would want her to stop. It was uncomfortable for her daughter. It was like she was competing with her daughter.

Then the main dish came.

"Oh, were you still coming to school loser?"

Of course she was grinning. Lacey was always grinning against me. She hated my guts.

She stood there with her lips polished and twisted in an always attractive way. Her hands were crossed in front of her and her skirt was so short that her panties were showing. Her shoelaces were tied so vigorously that they looked like they would snap any second. Who else could it be but Lacey.

"Colita, did you miss me?" she said, "I thought you had given up on school"

_That chapter was just a breather, once it's done we can move on. Now there's no stopping or breathing, we're running all the way to the end!!!
Thanks guys, thanks again._

### Chapter Nineteen - Lacey the Princess

In a game the princess always needed to be saved, but Lacey wasn't that way. She would bite back at whoever attacked her, ruthlessly, until they needed more saving than she did. Because there was no one who could run faster than her. It was like something in her had snapped and her cruelness had reached a new level. She couldn't be mended, touched. 

Nathan told me he went to her house a couple of times and she answered normally. He said she was completely fine.

Lacey walked past me, she turned, making her skirt snap to the side. The boys' head's travelled up with the skirt.

The fact that Lacey had appeared meant that she knew something about me, she had some raw material fresh to the world that would be used to shame, embarrass, or humiliate me.

Even more than she already had. 

She had an air of renewed confidence. And her confidence didn't come from inside, but from walking a long path treading over others, slowly getting higher and higher as she was pulled up by other's admiration of her.

She was quiet and normal during class, but as soon as the break came everyone flocked around her desk. "Are you alright?" They said, "We heard you were really ill"

"I was ill" she smiled, "But thanks to everyone here thinking of me, I don't mind anymore. I feel so much better, thank you everyone."

"I heard what happened" One of the fake girls whispered loudly, "It was so horrible of her"

Lacey looked at me, sitting alone on the side of the classroom. The moment she looked, I got glances from all of them, when they saw me they turned back to Lacey.

"Don't speak bad of someone her" Lacey said, "It really was my fault as well"

"You're so nice Lacey, even after that you're still thinking of her" Lacey was beaming from all the attention.

"No I'm not" she said, "I'm not that good"

"You're so good" The other fake girls said, "And you're so pretty too"

Then Colessa walked into the room, she looked at the girls talking, then at me. She nodded for me to come.

I got up and followed her out. The girls started talking about Colessa "They're friends? Is she cheating on Colessa as well?"

I closed my eyes not to let it get to me. Sometimes girls could be so harsh. When they got together they would never stop.

Colessa took me to the bathroom where we first met. She grinned and closed the door. "So...Lacey's back. Now I know the kind of girl she is." 

She wasn't baring her midriff anymore. 

"Colita, believe it or not, but you really did hurt her. I heard what you did, and that was inexcusable behavior, especially as an angel. You probably ruined school for her. Don't forget she's really a high school student, we're just studs okay?"

I bit my lip, it was painful but she was right.

"I'll try not to mind it" I said.

"If you need to talk, then come to me" Colessa said. "But we need to talk about Matt, we should take turns watching him. Do you want to start or should I?"

"I don't want to start" I wanted to get away from Lacey right now.

"Fine, I'll start, I'm going to sit at his table at lunch and follow him around and all that. Then maybe you can do it tomorrow?"

I agreed to it. Colessa was just about to leave before spinning back to ask, "Do you want a kiss? Will it cheer you up?"

"It's okay, I mean I'm okay thanks" I said. "Thank you for your concern though"

"Are you sure?"

"Yes, I'm okay" I said. I had kinda had enough of all this kissing and stuff, it didn't seem to lead anywhere, I knew Colessa was just trying to be kind but I had to reject it.

Then during lunchtime, I heard a big argument break out over at the popular table. 

I could hear Colessa screaming and shouting something at Lacey. Lacey was standing back looking shocked and upset that she was getting yelled at. She grabbed Matt's hand and hid behind him.

I sighed. So it wasn't just me. That girl was the real deal, she won the award for most fake, most annoying, most insulting little brat EVER.

Moments later Colessa gave a loud scream and ran out. Everyone was stunned, their latest drama had been more than interesting.

Julia came over to my table with her tray. "Lacey said Colessa was throwing herself at Matt. She said Colessa looked really stupid."

I rubbed my palm against my head. Matt was one issue, Lacey was a whole different level.

"You guys can do something right? You're angels" Julia bit into a chopping of silver-beet.

"You can't tell anyone that okay?" I said.

Julia nodded.

"Why did you save me the other day?" Julia said. "I was so mean to you, but you still saved me. I even ignored you in my house."

"I can't just ignore someone, you're a living person." I said "But yeah, that was weird. Why did you ignore me? I felt really unwelcome."

"Well I just want to say sorry now about that. I treated you badly."

"It's okay Julia" I said, "It's finished now"

"It's not okay" Julia said, "You're like a saint right? I treated a saint badly, I hope I'm not punished"

"I'm not a saint Julia, I'm just like you, a human. I won't punish you, what are you talking about?"

Julia looked past me, "No, not you, I hope God doesn't punish me for hurting your feelings."

"Julia, we're friends right?"

"Yeah" Julia said, "But, I don't want to do that kind of thing with you, I feel like I'm sinning when I upset you, because you're an angel, you're not supposed to get upset."

"It's fine" I said, "I'm like any other person you see, I'm no different so you can say anything." 

Julia went and did something else, "I feel bad for liking you" (Even best friend perceives differences) "Not just because you're a girl, but because you're not even human"

The more I heard it the more of an insult that was. That I wasn't human? So was she treating me differently? The only reason she knew I wasn't human was because I saved her LIFE, how could she go on saying that? What did she think? That I didn't ever get upset and I was always perfect? That I always showed the exact right kind of kindness that someone needed? I had feelings too, I got upset, I got sad, and I got angry when people disregarded me as a person with them.

"Now that I think of it, I think I was jealous" Julia bit into another chopping of silver-beet.

"Of what?" 

"Of just how you have this power" she raised her hands as if I was a cartoon character. "You can do anything"

"No, I can't" I said.

"You saved me Colita, twice! That's got to mean something."

"Shh, don't speak so loud, someone might hear you. That's all I can do though."

"Then it's not that" she bit another chopping of silver-beet. "I was jealous of your happiness, you're never sad or upset. Do you heal yourself? Can you do it to me to? But not if you don't want to okay?"

"What are you talking about? Have you not seen me sad before?" I changed tacts, "Do you even see me sitting in front of you right now in your monologue?"

Julia shook her head slowly, "No, I really haven't, how do you do it? Why are you always happy?"

I guess she was too sad to see anyone else sad. Or else people could only envy the happiness that they saw around them, and were blind to their own.

"I wasn't born like this" she said. "I used to be really happy, inviting everyone to my birthday parties and things when I was a little girl. But when I entered high school, everyone kind of got into their cliques, and I...never really...got into one...And then from then I just started to feel sad and it got worse and worse until I just kind of gave up. The only joy I could see was to end my life"

I looked around...everyone around us was laughing and joking around. Julia was probably the only one telling me how sad she was.

"I'm not afraid to die" she put her fork down. "Sorry, I know you didn't ask, but I'm really grateful for a friend like you. You're the only one who will listen to what I have to say. When I'm around you I get excited to talk." She bit into the last of her silver-beet, letting it swish around her teeth. Then when she swallowed it with some water, she put her hand on mine.

"Next time I do it" she said, "I want you to come and save me again, is that okay?"

"No Julia" I shook my head "What are you thinking? You've got a serious problem you know"

"If you don't come and save me, then I'm going to tell everyone in school about you and Colessa, how you're not human but pretending to be human."

"No, don't do that" 

"Look, I don't know why you're here in this school, but I just want you to give me this little help okay? Your kind can do that right?"

"Julia, we're pretty much the same as humans...you should stop talking like we're so different." 

"Okay okay" she said. "You got bullied by Lacey, and just now Colessa got bullied by Lacey as well. I do all the time. You can keep using that as an excuse why you get bullied by her, because you're 'angels' or whatever that means" She did bunny ears with her fingers. "But I can't use that excuse, I have no reason like that for why I don't fit in at school." 

I fell silent. I suddenly felt her pain, how she really had difficulty fitting in, so much that it was affecting her study, the whole time she was thinking about this.

"Old people say I'm smart or whatever, but I always think other people talk about boring stuff" she said, "But that just separated me further from everyone else. I'd rather be the same as everyone." 

"Okay" I said, "I understand, but you can't do something like that again" I said, "It's your LIFE Julia, that's not something to throw away, you only have one."

"Stop yelling at me" she said, "I've already made up my mind"

They say that criminals leave and repeat their actions, Julia was the same, but with something else.

"Next time you are worried about me" Julia said, "Just call me okay? I promise I will answer the phone within ten rings, just count one two three..."

"I can count to ten Julia!"

"Then count to ten and if I still haven't answered, then you know something has happened."

"I'm afraid, what if it really happens, the next time I call you, you won't answer, even after I let it call for ten rings."

"But you actually want me not to answer right? So you can be rid of me and all of this trouble. It's funny, although you want me to answer within ten rings, it would save you a lot of trouble if I didn't."

"No, it's not funny" I said, "I love you so much that I want you to answer me, every time, even if you're in pain and suffering, I want you to answer the call, you have to. It's no trouble at all, okay? Don't ever think like that"

"Okay" she held up her hands, "Just chill a bit, you're kind of freaking me out"

"You can't joke about this, if you know you're going to do it, then why don't you try to help yourself instead of relying on me? It's not your life to take, it's not a life that I can give. Your parents gave you your life, God gave you your life" I said. "Can't you appreciate it?"

"If you were me" Julia said, she was suddenly quiet, "If you were me, then would you appreciate this life? What do I have that anyone would possibly want? What do I have to offer to others, when I can't talk to anyone without them thinking I'm weird. It doesn't take too many rejections from others to learn that."

I had no answer, but I had to convince her to stop. "You can't do it again, if you do it again I will tell your Mom."

"If you do that, then I'm going to tell everyone here who you really are!" she said. 

"Hey guys" Nathan came to out table and pulled the chair beside me open. He sat down and looked at us, "What were you guys talking about? You look all tense."

I was still fuming but had to restrain myself, Julia gave me a burning laser gaze reminding me of what the consequences were if I were to tell. "I was just going to go" She took her tray and left, I watched as she carefully emptied the contents into the bin. 

She hadn't eaten much, and her eating patterns were irregular. She was probably trying to lose weight.

"Now that she's gone, we can talk" Nathan said.

"Julia's gone?" I said.

"Yeah, she's kind of weird don't you think? She always gives me a bad look"

"No, I don't think she's weird" I said.

"Well relax, this time I'm not trying to ask you out" He pointed to my tray, "You done? Want me to take it away for you?"

"Okay..." I said.

He did so, then returned and pulled me up. "Let's go to the gym" he said, "There's something I want to show you"

I was happy, he was showing me a lot of attention even when he didn't need to. It was after I had fallen that I started to see the truth. "What is there?" I wobbled cooly. "That you want to show me?"

"I don't know" he said, "I just wondered if you'd want to hang out or something"

"That would be nice" 

Nathan looked at me, "That's the first time I've ever heard you agree with me."

"Really?" I said, "You must be mistaken"

"No" he grinned and tucked his arm around me, leaning on me. "I remember everything you say"
"Uh..." I pointed to his arm around me, "It's heavy, and everyone's watching"

"So?" he said, "Don't you want me to be your boyfriend?"

"Uh...no? I said we could hang out" 

Nathan stepped back, raising his hands innocently, "Fine, I guess we've taken a big enough step already"

On the way to the gym, on the second floor looking down into the sports area we passed by a group of people in our grade. 

And of course, directing the traffic was none other than 

"Lacey..." Nathan looked hesitant. "This path's been blocked off"

"Don't be silly" I said, "It's just Lacey"

"I don't mind it" Nathan said, "But you do right?"

He looked at me considerately, he was really thinking of my feelings. Why had I not noticed how kind he was earlier. He always came to check on me when no one else did. Even when he knew I slept with Matt, even when I looked bad after arguing with Lacey.

We approached the group. They were laughing about something, but when they saw us coming it calmed down. The guys stopped laughing and watched me. A few girls standing with Lacey cupped their hands and whispered to each other. Lacey kept talking about something.

I joined in the circle, being normal. But they stopped talking. It was getting awkward.

"Hey Colita" One of the guys said. "Where are you headed?"

"How's it going?" I said. "Nathan was just taking me to the gym"

The girls' eyes fell on Nathan, judging him as an enemy who betrayed them. 

One of the guys next to Nathan leaned over to say something to him. Nathan frowned and pushed him away. "So, does anyone else think Mr. Gilbert is weird?" he said.

"He's weird as" The guy who greeted me said. "He keeps talking about stars and planets in class. Mercury this, Mars that, it's so random."

Another guy laughed, "He does that with you guys too? With us it's just everyone's just quiet and we ignore him"

"Mr. Gilbert is actually really kind though" I said.

Everyone looked at me, "He's kind? Really?" Nathan said. "Colita tries to see the best in everyone when we all can't."

Lacey stared back at me with her arms crossed, the two other girls looked at Lacey, then followed her example and did the same.

"Mrs. Hofstadter is also kind of queer" another guy said, "She shoudl get with Mr. Gilbert. Seriously, what is with our school and weird teachers?"

Lacey grunted, "I'm leaving" she said, "I've had enough of this" She swung her head, flicked her hair and walked away like she was all that. The girls followed her out. They swung their butts like it was Christina Aguilera in Lady Marmalade.

We tried to carry on the conversation but it didn't really happen. Everyone felt kind of weird about Lacey leaving. 

Nathan looked troubled. "She still hates you huh?"

High school relationships only lasted a week but High school enemies lasted a lot longer.

Nathan went to ask Lacey why she left. He said he'd be back in a second, then when he came back he said Lacey left because I arrived.

"You didn't need to go and ask her that to find out" I said.

"Did you say sorry?" Nathan leaned to look at me. He moved a strand of hair away to see me properly. "Colita, did you let her know that you were sorry?"

"Yes, I did" I pulled my hair back. "I told her okay?"

"Good" he said, "I'm proud of you."

I felt strange when he moved to look at my hair. I hadn't felt this when I was doing more with others, but just now when Nathan touched me I felt nervous, like it was something important.

"Well, because of that, lunchtime's almost over" he said. "We should make our way back to class"

He walked off, but I grabbed his hand and held it, standing still. He took a step then looked back. "Colita?" he looked down at my hand holding his.

"Sorry" I said, "Just for a moment, let me hold your hand, is that okay?"

He came back to me, hugging me tightly. "You're hurt huh?"

"Maybe" I let myself sink into him. "Do you like me?"

"Of course I do" he said. "I like you now more than I ever did, I'm so glad you came to this school."

"I know class is starting, but I want to go and hang out with you" I said. 

I felt Nathan's cheeks tighten right next to my head. I looked up and saw that he was smiling, really big. "Sure" He picked me up easily, then carried me over to the bleachers. He sat right next to me and put his arm around me. 

"Aren't you afraid that others will see you?" I said, "I'm not popular with Lacey"

"I want them to know" Nathan said, "I want everyone here to know that I like you"

I felt so happy. There were horrible people in school, but there were kind ones like Nathan as well. 

Five minutes late, we went to class, promising to meet again after school.

Then Colessa was waiting for me.

"Colita" she said.

"Colessa" I couldn't help smiling, "How are you?"

"I'm fine thank you" she said, "But I saw you were just with Nathan."

News sure spread fast. "Yeah, I kind of like him, isn't it great!" 

Colessa bit her lip, "I need to warn you about him"

"What? He's a player? The first thing he asked me was to have sex with me, I already know that"

"No" Colessa shook her head. "It's something more serious. Max and I have been suspecting that he might be the one targeting Matt."

"What? How is that possible?" Of all the guys I knew, why were they talking about Nathan? The only person who was kind to me.

"Be careful with him" Colessa said. She uncrossed her hands and walked into the classroom to join the teacher's lectures.

### Chapter Twenty - Nathan the Philanthropist

Nathan wasn't that conceited, he wouldn't treat angels differently to how he treated humans. And he wasn't nice to humans, knowing Nathan, he treated everyone badly. So this special treatment from him had to mean something right?

I spent the whole class thinking over Colessa's words. I had to talk to her about it again. She could just be lying, or trying to get me to lose interest in Nathan so she could have him for herself.

But when I stood outside the classroom waiting for everyone to leave, and for Colessa to come out, I got a nasty surprise. Colessa didn't come out, but when I peered in, I saw a petite blonde girl with a nice dress and sparkling shoes. 

Lacey turned to me, she had victory in her eyes.

"Were you waiting for me?" she said, "That's so kind of you" She glanced around inconspicuously to see if she had any of her ally girls around, but they had gone out first.

"Why are you avoiding me?" I said.

"I'm not avoiding you?" she said "You're avoiding me?"

"It's so immature" I said, "I know you're trying to make me look bad in front of everyone, but it's not working you can do what you like and you're not going to break me. So let's just stop here okay?"

"You're such a loser" she said, "Don't you know what everyone is saying about you? I'm just trying to help you, at least I'm honest and don't hide or anything liek everyone else does. Is that how you treat a friend."

Some part of me felt bad for accusing her. "I'm sorry if I made a mistake and this is wrong" I said, "But actually, I feel like you really dislike me for some reason"

"Do you know what everyone is saying?" she clung her bag closer under her arm.

"Go on" I said, "I have nothing to hide" The worst of me was already known to everyone, I couldn't be shamed any lower.

"If boys touch you, just touch you, you become a complete animal" she said, "You're a slut" she said it to my face, her lipstick perfect, and her skin perfect. But the words that came out of her were disgusting and filthy, oozing through the small pores in her skin like a green viscosity.

"Is that all?" I said, "Is that all theyre saying" I faked a laugh, "Then in that case I don't really need to worry do I? Since they're already saying the same things about you"

"No they're not" Lacey said, "You're lying"

"I'm not lying, ask anyone, your friends."

"Shut up, you don't even know who my friends are" she was losing control now. I bit my lip in victory. "You think you're all that, like you can waltz into our school and take everything, who are you anyway? Do you even have friends? You don't know anything about me do you"

This proved that Lacey didn't have much beneath that exterior shell she wore. She was as soft and mushy as liquid soap.

"I know that you need Matt to hold you, just so you can feel special, and so the other girls will all see you as some special girl more important than they are."

Lacey grunted, she actually grunted. I couldn't believe that kind of sound would come out of her cuteness. "I hate you" she said, "You're just weird, you don't even feel pressured by bullies, no other girls are like that. And you're not even afraid of what I say. You don't even try and you're so pretty, you don't go on diets and you hardly exercise. I've never met anyone like you, I'm genuinely scared of you, please dont' come close to me."

On that day, Lacey and I officially became enemies. And not just enemies that would lose their dislike for each other through high school and then forget about it afterwards. We were now enemies that would no longer get along in life. And maybe generations after us, our children would shun each other in antimony in remembrance. It was the kind of stain on personality that couldn't be removed by a passing of time. 

Ah, sigh.

Lacey still avoided me, and she still stuck to Matt. It was like nothing had changed between us. But, a padlock had been put on her heart and the lock was permanently for me. If anyone ever asked her what that padlock was for that she kept her heart in. She would say that she saved it for someone who was no longer important to her. Someone who really didn't matter to her anymore.

I left the class in a haze and walked down the corridor. Julia soon joined me, but I was still thinking about Lacey and what had just happened. It wasn't that she was bad, and it wasn't that I was bad, well we were both bad. But for some reason we always clashed head to head when we met. Maybe if we had been born into different circumstances then we would be more similar.  

That's what I thought until I felt my necklace around my neck. It felt sharp and cold to the touch, but warm against my skin, only because it had been there for so long. Who was I kidding, I'm was an angel. Nothing else.

Colessa was sitting alone at lunch. Julia and I joined her. She looked up and smiled, her eyes were red, like she had just been crying. But Julia and I knew not to ask, there were some things better left unsaid.

"Is it Nathan?" I didn't mind Julia hearing, she already knew we were angels.

"I don't know" Colessa answered blankly. "I don't know anymore, it's just what Max said"

"Why do you say that?" I said. "Nathan is a good guy, he shows me kindness all the time"
 
"Uh hem" Julia put her fork down. "Actually Nathan isn't kind to anyone, he's more of the type to be a bully than anything" Julia said, "I don't know why he's been showing so much kindness to you"

"That's it" Colessa said, "Colita, you think he's being loyal and nice, but he approached me with the exact same things" Colessa said. "I bet he is only treating us differently because he thinks we're angels, or even worse, he knows."

What..."Nathan isn't like that"

"Isn't like what?" I turned to see Nathan pulling open a chair and sitting down again. He rubbed his hair two or three times. We all fell silent without knowing it. "So...what were you guys saying about me?" He looked at me, "Have you finally decided to go out with me?"

"Did you ask Colessa as well?" I said, "Are you hitting on her as well?"

He looked at Colessa, moving his eyes down her. "Yeah, I did. I'm a man, I will hit on every girl that I want, you two are the hottest girls in the school, of course I want to be inside you."

I felt the hairs on my spine shoot up. This guy was disgusting. Colessa also looked at him in disgust. I guess we were both surprised at how easy human guys could be. Were they all like this?

"How about me?" Julia said. She spoke out of the darkness like the sparkling from the blade of a knife. "Do you want to come inside me as well?"

 Nathan looked her up and down, as if he were noticing her for the first time. "No thanks" he said. "I get insecure around girls who are wider than I am. Besides...yeah, I don't think I'm that into you."

If Julia was hurt she didn't show it. She held a poker face without betraying any expression whatsoever. "Oh, is that right"

Nathan's attention glided over to me. "You're free this weekend right? Wanna go to the movies together?"

"No thanks" I said, "You insulted my friend, I don't think I'm that into guys like you"

"Hey" Nathan tried to smile to make me smile as well. "You and I got along so well remember?"

"No" I said, "I don't remember, I thought I knew you but now I'm not so sure anymore." I got up and put my tray back, Colessa and Julia followed. I wanted to get away from Nathan. It was strange how fast feelings changed. 

"What did you say?" he called out, "I didn't hear the last part"

We ignored him and walked out.

"Just because he followed us isn't enough evidence to say that he's targeting Matt" I said. 

"This is true" Colessa said. "Maybe it was just because I didn't like him so I was saying that."

"He's just a typical guy" Julia said. "None of the guys look at me, they only see you two cause you're so much prettier than I am. That's all people care about anyway, how attractive you are."

"But...Colessa" I said, "If Nathan isn't the suspect, then who is? We really don't have anyone else to look at, we literally have no clues at all."

"It doesn't matter" Colessa said, "We just need to protect Matt, that's all" She looked at Julia, she was obviously uncomfortable with Julia overhearing everything we were saying. 

"It does matter" Julia said. 

"You don't know anything, so don't speak, please, let us sort this out." Colessa looked at me with eyes saying 'Why-did-you-have-to-let-her-know? We-can't-let-humans-know-we're-angels.'

"But I know that it matters" Julia said, as if she knew the look"Because it's not just about Matt, it's also about protecting Matt, why would anyone ever want to hurt him?"

Out of nowhere tears welled up in her eyes. She screamed into the air. "Why does it have to be like this, even for you guys who are so popular. You can't be equal with humans the way you want to, why does everyone have to be so left out?"

The amount she knew was a bit creepy, she seemed to know all of me and Colessa's concerns. But even more so, she was suddenly really upset by it. 

"Julia" I said, "You don't need to worry, really, thank you for your concern though." 

"No" Julia said, "I'm not happy about how we all have to fight just to fit in. The fact that you even feel this way means that you are human, just like us" She waved to the school, "Just like everyone here"

Then I felt a shudder. It took a simple human girl to let us know the most obvious truth that we had always known but not dared to accept.

We could be human as well, no matter how others treated us. 

We were basically the same.

We were the same.

### Chapter Twenty

I was dead tired by nine pm, but I lay awake because I was waiting for a phone call from Max. For hours and hours I was dreaming of sleep, forgetting about tomorrow and everything else. That's when the call came, at 3 fricken am. 

"Colita?" Max said. 

"Yeah, I was waiting for you to call, do you know how tired I am?"

"Sorry, you can sleep after this"

I couldn't sleep at all. "What is the important thing you wanted to tell me?"

"Have you been using your powers?" he said. 

So he had finally found out. I knew it was a matter of time, but I thought I would be in trouble earlier. 

"I have" I decided to play the honesty card. "Just to help Matt out"

"But Colessa told me that you never healed Matt"

"Colessa doesn't know anything" I said. "She practically just got here, compared to me she's just an innocent."

"Yes, but right now I trust her more than I trust you, you're my ex girlfriend..."

"So you're saying you still have feelings for me? If you didn't have feelings for me then you would trust me more right?"

Max groaned, "Don't make this into an argument as well, can we just talk business for once"

"Well you're the one who started by blaming me for being your girlfriend before"

"I wasn't blaming you" he said, "I was just saying..." I gripped the phone with all of my feelings resurfacing. It all depended on what he said right now. 

"Watch your words carefully" I said, "I'm still not completely healed from what you did to me"

"Ok, let's just change the topic okay?" It was silent, but I knew what he was doing, he was leaning back in his brown leather chair and looking at the ceiling. he probably wanted a smoke right about now, and was wondering if I had one. 

I opened the window and threw my cigarette out. Then I took a long look at the grass and the moon. It really was nice, this human world. The more I looked at it the more I wished we could also be more of a part of it. Were we already a part of it or was there more that we were missing out on?

After the phone call I felt nervous and called up Julia. I counted the rings, "One, two three, four..."

"Hello?" A sleepy voice answered, "Is this Colita? What time in the morning do you think it is? Stop calling me at this time."

I couldn't help smiling, "Sorry, I'm just glad you're fine"

"Of course I'm fine, are you fine?" 

She hung up.

There was a knock on the door. I shot up, it was 3am, who could possibly be here. And knocking meant that they knew I was awake.

"Colita, is that you? It's Colessa" I opened the door with the chain, sure enough Colessa was standing there, with some cupcakes in a tray. She smiled. "Sorry to bother you so late at night, but Max told me to come and visit you, he said we have a meeting."

"I was just on the phone with him" I said. "Do you want to join in with us?" It seemed like everyone wanted to join in right about this time, it was a party. Who had school tomorrow? Who went to school anyway?

Colessa heated up the tray in the oven. I had forgotten that Max was still on the other end.

"Are you girls enjoying it there?" he said, "In a human school, you must feel really welcome, are people treating you nicely?"

"Yes, we're having a lot of fun" Colessa said. "Human schools are really great places"

"That's good, very good" Max was happy just to see us enjoying ourselves. 

"Are you asking us that because it's about to change?" Colessa said. "Does that mean that things are going to get difficult for us now?"

"Well, things are going to be more...abrupt" The way Max said it made it sound like he didn't know either. Besides, how did Colessa know what Max was going to say, it seemed like they knew each other much more than I understood Max.

"If you've been healing anyone" Max said, "Angel Corp needs to know about it, we can't have angel powers being used without any authority, it needs to change."

Both of us fell silent, being reprimanded wasn't nice, no matter how old you were.

"I just called you both here to give you a rejuvenating safety briefing on why you are here. I don't want you to forget that."

"It's to protect Matt isn't it?" I said, "We already know that"

"Remember what every angel learns before they go on their first mission?" Max said.

"Is this about the very first angel in existence? How she was very nice and kind to everyone no matter what?

"Go on, please" Max said.

Colessa looked up to try and regain her memories, "Her name was Clara, she always helped others with her powers and always made sure that everyone was happy. She only saw the best in others and strived everyday to make a better world for every human and angel after her."

I sighed, "Somewhere along the way, we lost the plot. Look at us now, we're pathetic."

Colessa shook her head, "No, you're wrong Colessa, people of the past would die just to be able to be here with us now, we're witnessing the time when angels will become equal with humans, there has never been any time more important in our whole history. One breath from us is worth a life from other generations. Every angel would love to be in our shoes right now, we're literally creating the stepping stones of history, carving out a new path for our race. One person defining everything so many people do. We are the cupholders for the future of our generation."

"But remember what happened to Clara?" Max said.

I remembered it as well, we had all learned it in school. It was instilled in every young angel's mind since young.

Colessa went on, "After a while the humans noticed that she had these healing powers and they isolated her. They started calling her an angel, something separate from humans, but not necessarily bad. But eventually they started treating her worse, disregarding her as a human. Then Clara came to know how the human world could be violent. As soon as humans find out that you aren't human, they will treat you badly. Because you aren't human, it doesn't matter what they do to you."

"But not all humans are like that, some are really kind" I said.

"What do you mean Colita, are you saying that someone knows you're an angel?"

"No, I just think that some people would actually embrace us if they knew, if we could show them how much good we can do." 

"Don't try it" Max said. "Look, I'll be coming over there next week to see things for myself, so until then just lay low and don't do anything ridiculous."

Max was coming? My heart started racing, suddenly I really wanted to see him. I had been talking to him so much over the phone that now I wanted to meet him again. He gave me more than any of the guys I met ever did.

"That's what I wanted to tell you guys, that everything is going to be over soon. It won't be much longer before you can return back to angel corp." 

"But it hasn't been ten months" Colessa and I said together.

"I know you're itching to return, and things are happening much faster than we expected so it should be fine." He held the receiver still, "Okay, well I'll call you up next time okay?"

"Mmm, bye" I said.

Colessa told me that she was actually really worried about Max. "I'm really worried about him" she said. 

After the phone call I sighed because I actually really wanted Max to one day say on the phone "I'm proud of you Colita, you're an excellent angel." But even nearing the end of the mission, he never said it. No matter how old I was, even if I was supposed to be a mature and responsible adult, I still wanted to hear something like that every now and then from someone who meant something to me.

Everyone told me different things, some said I should be an angel. If I can just become a proper angel, then I will feel like I have proved others and found my identity. Then there will be no more need for pursuits.

Colessa put her hand on me. She rubbed my shoulder and moved it down my loose shirt, tucking her fingers in the opening to my neck.

"I'm lonely in pursuing something, have nothing to talk about with others, have nothing to say.They all talk about phones or boys or school work, but I have none of those worries. I'm glad that you're here, because I can talk to you about it."

Colessa dipped her hand into my shirt, moving her fingers over my bra, playing at the straps. Her other hand held my waist, feeling its big curve that was round like a skate park.

"I know you're just saying this because you just had a talk with your ex" she said, "But I want you to know that I'm not lonely." She moved my strap and placed her fingers on the skin beneath. 

"I think it's just you" she said.

Then she untapped my bra and let it fall to my stomach, under my shirt. I lifted up my shirt and it fell out. 

I looked up at Colessa, her face was right next to mine. Her breathing was soft and smooth. Her hair was disorganized but kind.

Her hands stopped for a second and she looked down at me.

---

### Chapter Twenty One - Julia the Daughter

_So now we're going to see some action, some drive towards the end._

Colessa had already left in the morning. I put on my uniform and dragged myself to school. Mr. Gilbert was still too shy to look up, three or four days later. I didn't know anymore, it was too much to remember. 

But just as I got to the school gates, I saw some students walking back. They weren't ignoring me, but walked past me normally. 

Great so now they don't ignore me but just walk past as if I'm nothing drizzle drizzle drizzle, I guess that's improvement.

I saw Colessa standing at the gate. She turned to me already smiling, like she recognized me from somewhere before I even arrived. Maybe she saw my reflection in on the watery ground, or maybe she just knew all about me.

"There's no school today" she said.

"Why not?" I said.

She widened her arms and leaned back, immersing herself in the sunshine that was coming over the hill. "Because of teacher training" she said. "So we don't need to do anything today, we're free." 

"But we still need to..." I stopped because I saw other students approaching. They looked at me and smiled, I smiled back. They knew who I was but I didn't know them. That was just the way it was. That's what we all did.

"Don't worry, I'll watch him today" Colessa said. "You've probably had a hard time already, so let's go and do things together later okay? Sometime soon."

"That's great" I said. "Thanks a lot"

"So you're free today?" I turned to see Julia. I had none of the cool prediction that Colessa could manage. Julia's presence surprised me.

"So do you want to come over?" Julia said.

"Not particularly" But Julia didn't listen, she pulled me with her.

Colessa smiled and waved, there was nothing she could do. "Sorry, I'll see you next time Colita" she saw I was being pulled away by Julia and ran away.

I walked behind Julia all the way to her house. She would suddenly stop and tell me random things. Then when I asked her a question she suddenly jumped forward as if she had never spoken. I guess she moved like a frog would.

"Where did you spend your time growing up?" she said.

"Just overseas" I said, "Probably not anywhere you would know"

"Hmm" she said, "Is that why you're so weird?"

"Huh?"

But she had already gone forward.

Then when we got to her house her Mom opened the door for us. "Hi" she said, "You must be Julia's friend, Colita?"

I bowed, "Thank you for having me"

Julia's mother had the same eyes as Julia did, but her hair was a lot lighter in color. She was also more active than Julia was. I learnt that she was a dance instructor. I didn't see anything depressed about her. She wore tight clothes that showed her confidence off, but weren't too revealing to be immodest. And she smiled and made sure I was well cared for. I went up to Julia's room, then her Mom called me down and asked me if I wanted a drink, or something to eat.

"No thanks, I'm fine, I'm just visiting" I noticed that it was still around 10am.

"I'm not working today" she said, "I'm glad Julia's brought her friend over, she's always alone, so I started to wonder. I mean, every parent will start to wonder like that" She made me a smoothie of some sorts and sat down at the table. 

She began asking me all sorts of questions, about how my I was adjusting to this new school, if there were any boys I liked, and to make sure that I don't spend too much time on them and forget about my grades. Then she put her empty smoothie down and brought out another one.


"How is Julia doing at school?"

So this was her real reason for calling me down.

"Does she have many friends?"

"She's doing fine" I lied, "What did she tell you?"

Julia's Mom closed her eyes and rubbed her temples. Then she finally looked back at me, with a big sigh of relief exiting her. "That's good, I'm really worried about that girl. She comes home but never tells me anything. But she's really a good girl, she always helps me with dishes and things, but as soon as I ask her about her friends...she shuts me out and completely ignores me.

"That's how daughters are" I said. Then I held my mouth, I wasn't supposed to know this stuff.

"You speak like you're so much more mature than you are" she said. "Do you have a younger sibling?"

"No" I said. "I just think it's that way"

As I sat there talking to Julia's Mom, I began to forget about school and power play and appreciated the life around me. I started to feel envious of Julia, she had a Mom as great as this who cared about her so much. Why did she still have to do such hurtful things to herself? Did her Mom know about this? If she didn't, then would I be the one to have to tell her?

"Julia and I were planning on going shopping today" Her Mom said, "Would you like to come along? We were just looking for a prom dress"

"Prom?"

"Don't you know? Prom is coming up soon, I thought all of your girls would know about it."  

"Oh, I just didn't realize that it was so soon" No one had mentioned it. 

"Just wait a week, then everyone will be talking about it. Julia is going to find a boy to dance with. Well, she has to make herself acceptable to boys first. Right now she says she's not interested in guys."

"That's not true" I smiled, "She's into them"

Julia's Mom smiled, "Like I said, she doesn't tell me anything anymore. I just hope she's happy at school. Colita, you're the first friend of hers I've met. Does she have many?" 

I didn't have the courage to lie to Julia's Mom. But I couldn't tell her that Julia only had me for a friend, and was otherwise teased and mistreated by her classmates.

If I ever wanted to tell Julia's Mom the truth about Julia then it was now.

"Don't worry" she put a smoothie on the table in front of me. "You don't have to answer that. I was just joking, of course Julia's fine."

I sat with my head bowed, silently sipping the contents of the smoothie. It probably had a lot of healthy things in, intended to keep us energetic and kind. Julia had this kind of food all the time. Besides, her mother was great. She really cared about Julia and wanted the best.

"So you're coming right? Can you tell Julia that we'll be leaving at 12, right after lunch?"

"Okay" I nodded. "I'll do that." I looked at the lunch, it was just me and Julia's Mom. "Is Julia eating?"

"She says she's on a diet..." Julia's Mom rolled her eyes. "Again, I don't know what to do with that girl." She took my plate away, "Don't worry about her, she'll start eating as soon as one of the boys at school takes an interest in her; girls are like that."

I went upstairs, the smell of lunch had wafted all through the house. As I went upstairs the stairs creaked and I was reminded of when I first came here. Now that Julia's Mom was here it was a lot nicer, the house was more cosy. 

The food I just had was so good, and then next we were going shopping. It was a good lifestyle to have.

I knocked on Julia's door then went in. She wasn't in the room, the curtains were open, the bed was still messy with clothes lying all over it. I walked over to close the window and noticed that the bed was still warm. Julia must have gone to sleep again just before I came up. I closed the door and arranged things to look more tidy. Julia's Mom was chopping up some more vegetables, it echoed through the house like a grandfather clock.

Then I saw a skirt lying on the carpet. It was one of Julia's, a light brown skirt that barely reached the knees.

Then a little further up was a petite yellow T-shirt. I picked them up, then noticed two socks lying further away. They looked like they had been thrown down and trampled into the carpet in a hurry.

A bad feeling was playing through me. Right in front of the door was pale pink underwear, there were brown stains running on it. The underwear was wet with whatever. I pushed the ensuite door open and saw a bra tangled up against the wall.

Then I pushed the shower curtain open and saw Julia. Blood was dripping from her wrists onto the floor, a puddle had formed, the sides of it were half dry already with a thick layer forming on the surface. Her feet were pale white and hung over the edges of the bathtub, her legs spread out and exposing herself.

Her eyes were closed and she looked peaceful.

"Julia, are you ready to go?" Julia's Mom called out, "We should go before the mall gets crowded"

What was happening here? Was this normal? Was it deliberate? Did every human girl have this kind of ritual? Was this amount of bloodflow their period?

I ran over to Julia and cradled her in my arms. "Julia, why, why" I kissed my necklace, waited for it to glow, then kissed her lips. It drained a lot of my energy, I felt more and more tired. But eventually Julia's eyes opened. 

She kissed back desperately, but she had no energy either. She had just been dead.

I sat on the bed and stared outside. Exhausted.
Julia got up, then put on her bra, she opened the door and put on her undies. Then her socks and shirt and pants. She stood right next to me with a smile.

"Thank you" she said. "I knew you'd save me"

I didn't want to look at her. "You've got a serious problem" I said, "You need to stop doing this. Do you know how much the people around you care about you? Do you know how much your Mom loves you?"

"She doesn't love me by choice" Julia said, "She has to love me because I'm her daughter."

I stared at her, "Isn't that enough? Do you think everyone has someone else to love them so much? Do you know what I would do to have someone love me so much? It doesn't matter if it's conditional or not, does it?"

I sunk my eyes into my palms. I couldn't look at her, someone who so easily threw away everything they had. "I just wanted to spend one day as a normal human. A normal human didn't have healing powers, I just wanted to spend one day as a normal human would, without healing anyone. Just once..."

"You're an angel" Julia said, "Why do you act like you want to be human? I'm human, and I can tell you that it sucks, if I could change shape anytime and heal anyone then I would, and I would be happy. I'm so sick of this" She pointed to her reflection in a mirror, "I'm sick of...me!"

"Stop doing it deliberately" I said, "It's an insult to those who love you, and most of all to yourself. I won't help you next time. You need professional help."

Julia looked at me blankly like she had heard it all before. "Okay" she said.

"Julia, Colita, we're going now!" Julia's Mom called out. 

I opened the door to answer, then turned around to Julia. "Come on, let's go have some fun, we've had enough here"

"Okay" Julia said she would clean up the bathroom first before coming down.

"It's your prom dress" I said, "Aren't you excited for one?" I felt bad about reprimanding her and wanted to be the nice friend.

Julia saw me, she must have felt more confident when I talked about her prom dress. I was someone she respected. That was what respect did, it made my words weigh more and etch further into the prints of her mind, even though I wasn't her mother and was just a friend.

Julia came down to the car and we drove off. Julia's Mom asked us about school and homework, the general questions. 

"Did you know Julia used to be in the drama club in intermediate?" she said. 

"Argh, Mum stop!" Julia said, "You don't need to tell everyone about me"

"Why can't I? You're my daughter" she turned the wheel as we cruised before a traffic light. "How come you don't stand on stage anymore?"

"I do" Julia said, "I stand on stage everyday and act all the time, I memorize what I'm supposed to say and perform it to make it convincing. It's called REAL LIFE Mom, you're welcome"

"But you don't stand on a stage for school, you used to be so good at it"

"I'm not interested in drama anymore" Julia rested back in her seat.

Julia's Mom sighed and looked into the rear mirror at me. "Colita, do you have anything you do, maybe Julia can join you in it"

I thought about what I liked to do, smoke, trash talk, and flirt with Max. 

"Umm...not really" I said. "But I like coming over to meet Julia"

"That's good, you two are a good match" Julia's Mom pulled into a parking spot with dexterity, stopping the car just perfect so that three cars perfectly surrounded us. Her driving instructor would be proud.

"Let's get you a dress" She took Julia's hand and they marched off.

### Chapter Twenty Two - Julia The Daughter 2

The mall wasn't the biggest, but it was the biggest in this area, people from neighboring areas all came here to shop for goodies.

Prom dresses were considered goodies. The clothes stores and all the big names in the mall had their walls drenched in dresses. Frilly, not frilly. Pink, not pink. Strapped, strapless. There were dresses of all shapes and sizes for girls of all shapes and sizes.

The moment we walked in and saw this Julia's Mom was overwhelmed. "Oh my, I didn't realize prom was so big."

Julia grunted, "Of course it is Mum, it's called life, Have you heard of it before?" She charged forward like this was all her territory, with a gaze she instantly worked out which stores had the best sales. We went into Cotton On: Jeans and picked out dresses. 

"Why don't you try this one one?" Julia held up a strapless slim black dress for me.

"Umm...I don't think so" I saw the price tag and almost fainted. It would cost a fortune to buy. 

"Are you sure?" Julia's Mom said, "What are you wearing to prom? Have you got a design yet?"

To be honest, I never even thought about prom. The way things were going with the mission, Max said we might be ending it early so I might not even be here until the end of the school year.

"I'll think about it in a few months" I forced a smile, "But you should have fun deciding."

They both stared at me. Julia was holding up a dress and almost dropped it. "This is your prom!" she almost screamed, "This is the most important day of your life, you have to wear something that looks good, you can't go in school uniform you know."

Wow, Julia was upset. Her Mom tried to calm her down. "Do you want to try that one on?"

Julia shook her head, "I already know which one I want" She pointed up to the sky. We followed her gaze, we went past the dresses that all hung on the wall, past the expensive ones that were in stock, and then above that, there was a sparkling dress in gold and silver. It was so divine that it looked like ti had a halo circling it. I felt sorry for Julia's Mom, she was covering her forehead with her hand, trying to block out the strong rays of glimmer emanating from it.

"Are you sure? You like that one?" Julia's Mom said. 

Julia smiled and she nodded.

We asked the store clerk to bring that one down. She looked at us in shock. "You're looking at this dress?" 

"What do you mean?" Julia's Mom said. "Can't we look?"

The store clerk was flabbergasted. She was barely older than us, she looked like she was born to wear fashionable clothes. "I mean, the dress is only in a small size" She looked at me, "Is it for you?"

Uhhh, this was awkward. 

"It's for this lovely lady here" Julia's Mom put her hands on Julia's shoulders. "Do you think it will suit her?"

"Suit her is one thing...oh well, try it on, what do I know" She walked off and opened up one of the changing rooms. Her sarcasm was deafening.

Julia stomped her foot as soon as the store clerk walked away, "She doesn't think the dress will fit me, because I'm so fat"

"You're not fat" Julia's Mom said. "Honey, go and try it on and show us, tell us what you think."

When Julia went in to get changed, Julia's Mom picked out another dress. "I think this would suit you" It was a pink dress. I had to admit it looked beautiful, I had never worn anything like it before. Angels never dressed up, they always wore casual clothes. It was rewarding to think that dresses like these existed.

"Thank you" I said, "But I can't accept it, it costs far too much"

"I can't have you watch Julia getting a dress and you not getting one."

"It's alright" I comforted her, "I really don't mind, I will decide sometime later so don't worry about me. Today is Julia's day."

Julia's Mom's brows fell. "Oh my gosh, I can't believe Julia has such a wonderful friend like you. You must have amazing parents, they did a better job than I did. Julia's so spoiled, but please stay with her forever. Are you best friend forever?"

“Uhh...I guess?”


We could hear Julia coughing while getting changed, the bottom of the door was visible, her jeans fell to the floor and sank in a heap around her shoes. She started humming while changing into the dress. One leg moving in and out of the shoes and in and out of the dress.

Julia's Mom leaned over as we both watched, "Did many boys ask you to the dance?" Julia's Mom said. "Hopefully she can learn a thing or two from you. I don't think anyone asked Julia to the dance. That's why if you could help her it would be great."

Then I saw a familiar face. The automatic door slid open and pink shoelaces that were strapped so tight that they might snap any second came prowling in.

"It's not here!!!" Lacey's voice wasn't a voice, it was a shriek. It pierced through every dress in the store.

She stood in tight black spandex jeans that were so sparkly that they reflected your reflection back at you. She had sunglasses tipped up onto her forehead and a ton of bracelets decorating her arms.

"It's not here Mom!" she said, "Someone took my dress"

This was the queen of sparkles looking for the dress she had claimed. Mrs. Triangle quickly marched in from behind her with a handful of cards and phones. "Wait a moment darling" she said, "I just got a new facebook notification, and all these apps are OUT OF CONTROL"

It was still salvageable. We just had to make sure that Lacey didn't see Julia wearing the dress. 

Lacey made the store clerk come over, As soon as she saw Lacey her attitude was different, she became a timid and gentle cat. To us she was a snobby and dismissive teen. And to Julia she was a rude and obese critic. 

"Lacey, you're here! Great!" she said, “We were awaiting your arrival”

'awaiting'? Wasn't that word like...off the dictionary?

"What so great?" Lacey didn't smile. She didn't need to, she had complete control over this girl. "Where's my dress?"

"We have another customer trying it on at the moment, but as soon as they're done..."

"It's my dress!" Lacey shouted, "Mom, tell them it's my dress."

Mrs. Triangle slipped her phone back into her bag, she looked up and walked right in front of the young store clerk. She trembled in the presence of Lacey's Mom.

"I don't know what happened, but I hope you know that's Lacey's dress. She's been looking forward to wearing it for three months now, since it was released on December 15th. As she says, and as she has so politely told you, and as she has sensibly remarked in a civilized manner, this is her dress."

"I understand" The store clerk said, "I'll sort this out right now"

As soon as the girl gave in Lacey crossed her feet and said out loud, "Well, who's wearing it? Is she pretty?"

The store clerk looked in our direction, she didn't know what to say. She couldn't say what she wanted to say, that Julia was fat, and she couldn't say that Julia was skinny either. It was a tough job to have.

"Is she prettier than me?" Lacey said, "If she's not, then she should know that it's my dress"

Lacey followed the store clerk girl's gaze and saw us. She scanned past Julia's Mom and set her eyes on me.

"Is it you? Are you prettier than me?" Lacey crossed her arms and walked up to me. She got it from her Mom. They were the same.

"Do you think you can always step on me?" Lacey said, "If you take my dress I'm going to make you regret it for the rest of your life." She finished and smiled. "Okay?"

The humming from the changing room grew louder. I saw the jeans and shoes being picked up. The curtain slid open and Julia came out with an upset look. She was holding the dress behind her, it was a bit long on her because she was short. And the pink was a little too intense for her lack of make-up.

Lacey's eyes travelled past the room like the terminator. She saw Julia wearing her dress and freaked.

Then,

Julia looked at Lacey, then at us, then at Lacey. She dropped her jeans and shoes.

Duh Duh Duh Duh!!!

This was bad...

### Chapter Twenty Three - Julia the Warrior

It was a battle of rampant ego and raging insecurity on both sides. When Julia saw Lacey staring at the dress she was wearing she felt a possessive patch pulse through her. To say that she was wearing the dress was a gross exaggeration. She held it in place on her body, the straps were clinging to her shoulders so tight that it was a wonder why they didn't snap any second. The waist was stretched so that it didn't look natural,  the dress reached almost down to her calves. It was designed to reach just above the knees.

Julia was obviously barely pulling it off, but her willpower overpowered her common sense.

"How does it look?" She ignored Lacey's threatening gaze and looked at us. "Does it suit me?"

"Uhhh..." It didn't, not at all, but I couldn't say that. Especially not while Lacey was watching us and judging everything we said.

"Darling, why don't you try something else?" Julia's Mom said, always the pacifist, "This dress doesn't really do you justice."

Lacey was fuming over us. Her Mom was moving her thumbs over her phone and smiling at something in her own world.

"It's my dress" Lacey said. "Give it to me before you break it"

"I'm not breaking it" Julia turned to Lacey, "I'm trying it out"

"You're so stupid, can't you see that you're too fat for it? Take it off before you ruin it"

"I'm not" Julia said. “Fat”

Lacey walked over to Julia, "When did you start talking back to me? Did you forget that I can ruin your life anytime I want?" She said it quietly so that the adults couldn't hear, "When did you get the courage to face me?"

"Go ahead" Julia said, "You can't do anything to me to make me feel worse than I already do, from you"

"Give me the dress, or I'll tell Jason what a loser you are, I know you've had a crush on him for ages."

"Mum!" Julia cried, "I want this dress"

"No" Lacey reached out and tried to pull on it, to get Julia out. "This is my dress"

I sighed and sat down. Julia's Mom went over to settle the girls down. "Julia, what about you give your classmate this dress, she probably has wanted it for a lot longer than you have. We can try out another dress, something more fitting."

Julia shook her head, "No, I want this dress, I don't want a different one" She looked at Lacey then grabbed the dress.

"It's expensive, don't break it" Lacey said.

Julia's Mom rubbed her forehead. "Why does it have to be this dress?" she reached over and pulled out another one the same color but a few sizes bigger. "Isn't this one nice? Look, it even has a pocket, and it's a third of the price." 

"I don't want that dress, it's fat, I don't need a pocket. I like this one. All the girls at school will love me."

(Show how the dress is a status symbol for school)

"It's mine, take it off!" Lacey grabbed the dress and tried to pull it off. "It's $700, you can't afford it. I was looking forward to having Matt see me in it."

Julia's Mom stared at Lacey, she squinted and looked over her. "Are you Lacey?" she said, "Lacey Triangle?"

Lacey smiled, "Yes?" Her attitude changed instantly the moment she talked to an adult.

Julia's Mom looked past Lacey and at Ms. Triangle. "London?" she said, "London Triangle?"

Lacey's Mom looked up from her phone, she tucked it away in her bag. "Is this Julia?" She put her hand on Julia's head and rubbed it. "Deborah?"

Julia's Mom smiled, "That's me. What a surprise to see you here."

"Wow" Lacey's Mom smiled, "I can't believe it, we haven't met in about ten years"

"Or more" Julia's Mom said, "Remember we used to take the girls to kindergarten together? They were both in the morning class."

Lacey's Mum looked at Julia, she held Lacey's hand. "You two were such great friends, I never knew you were in the same school, if I had known I would have invited you over for a sleepover."

"Mum!" Lacey said, "She's wearing my dress."

Lacey's Mom ignored her, "I can't believe you lived so nearby"

Julia's Mom turned to me, "London Triangle and I, we used to be great friends while we were pregnant, all while the girls grew up through kindergarten as well."

"And now we meet again to go shopping for the girls' dresses"

"What a coincidence" They both laughed. Lacey's Mom recognized me, "You're the girl who came over last time to apologize to Lacey right?"

"Yes" I said.

She turned away and looked at her phone, then showed Julia's Mom. "See, I still have a picture of the girls when they were so small."

I guess she didn't really care about me.

"They used to play together as well" Julia's Mom said. "We went over to your place once or twice"

"Yeah, what happened? We should get back in contact" 

The two mothers either couldn't see the laser beams firing from the girls' eyes at each other, or they didn't bother.

Lacey's Mom was like a more mature version of Lacey (she doesn't like the world 'old'), she wore a darker pink, and her shoes had graduated from shoelaces, otherwise they were almost identical. Julia's Mom wore really tight jeans with heels. She dressed young and elegant and showy. 

They started talking about everything, their jobs, their marriage, their lifestyles. 

"Mom, Julia's ruining my prom" Lacey said. 

"No, you're ruining my prom" Julia said.

The fight over the dresses was still continuing, there had been a brief ceasefire when the commanders of the forces recognized each other, but now they were preparing to engage once more.

"So do you both want this dress?" Ms. Triangle said. "I think it will fit Lacey better, don't you Julia?"

Julia shook her head, "I want this dress"

"It's because I want it, that's only why she wants it" Lacey said.

"Then give it to her" Lacey's Mom said.

"Julia, let them have it" Julia's Mom said. "We'll find you another dress" Julia retorted with something nasty and Julia's Mom rolled her eyes. "When did you become such a nasty girl? Is it how I raised you?"

Lacey tried to pull the dress off Julia, "Give it to me, there's only one of those, you can go get another one, I've wanted that one since I was five."

Julia stepped back as Lacey reached out, Julia took a deep breath to say something, just as she did, there was a loud rip. I saw the whole of the back zip fall apart.

"My dress!" Lacey ran over to check the zip. Julia spun around so Lacey wouldn't' get to it.

The store clerk also came over, "That's our most expensive item" she looked scared, her boss was going to yell at her.

"It's mine" Julia said.

The war ended with Julia's Mom buying the dress for Julia. It was ripped so they had to. Lacey cried for a while then left to find another dress.

The store clerk smiled in relief as Julia's Mom forked out the $700 for the dress. she wrapped it up in nice wrapping paper patterned with sophisticated shapes and dropped it in a big plastic bag. 

"Thank you for shopping with us today" she said. Her tone tone said she was happy to see us leaving.

On the way out, Lacey's Mom waved to me, like she completely forgot about what I had done. She chatted for a while to Julia's Mom. They both apologized for their daughter's behavior. 

"Sorry, Lacey should have had the dress, but Julia was being too stubborn"

"Oh no, you know Lacey's very demanding sometimes, and Julia was trying it on first, things like this happen sometimes. I'll see you around Deborah"

Lacey ignored me the whole time.

The dress was very heavy as we took it home. The car sunk down. It was tough to carry the weight of everything home.

"No more pocket money for a month" Julia's Mom said from behind the wheel. "You made me spend a fortune today, I hope you like the dress and wear it afterwards as well."

Julia didn't answer, she stared out the window in silence.

Even though she had gotten the dress nothing had changed. Julia was still Julia, the same Julia that had gotten in the car to leave for the mall. Just a few hours of difference. But that wasn't the most important, she could dress how she wanted to showering herself in all the accessories and distractions she could find. It wasn't for me to judge what she wanted to wear, even if it was just to compete with Lacey.

But was that same Julia also wanting the dress before seeing Lacey? Who knew about that...

More importantly,

I looked at Julia as she gazed out the window. She was carefully covering up her wrist where she had slit it, and the rope mark around her neck with a bright yellow turtleneck scarf. She was practically a walking injury. But she couldn't disguise what was inside, that she still wasn't happy, and that lack of happiness was leaking from her wrists.

And maybe she never would be happy.

### Chapter Twenty Three - Julia the Sleeper

Julia's Mom invited me over for dinner as well but I declined it, I needed to chat with Colessa, it was probably my turn to relieve her to watch over Matt.

Instead, Julia's Mom brought out some hand picked food she semi-cooked, semi-microwaved, and semi-loved.

"Does any other Mom cook like this?" she said.

"Mmm, it's delicious" Julia's Mom looked back as I chewed every bite carefully, every swallow was savoured. She seemed strangely worried about how I thought of her cooking. "A good woman is motivated by taste" she said, "That's what my husband always tells me."

"And is he right?" I said.

"He's my husband, they're always right" She cracked an egg into the pan and threw the remains into a huge bin next to her wrapped in plastic from head to toe, it wobbled a bit as the egg shell landed and splattered. "You'll know when you get married" Then laughed to herself.

She told me how housewives will like to compete with other housewives over the things they cook, even though it shouldn't be important.

I nodded. But a sad realization hit me that even though I was similar to her age, I had never cooked food for anyone, in our culture angels didn't do things like cook or clean or work like humans did. We just had one job, and if we failed it we became fallen angels. Basically disowned by even our own kind, it was cruel.

"Try this salmon" she said. I put it in my mouth, it had a salty taste from the soy sauce dipped on it.

"Now try this tofu" she said. "Always eat tofu in between eating other things, it is like something to cleanse your mouth of taste so you can start anew."

"Start anew?" I ate the tofu, then she gave me a sweetened egg over rice to try. 

"Relationships are the same" she said "We all need to start our relationships anew, so we need a verbal 'tofu'." I laughed, the way she said it made it sound hilarious.

"What are you two laughing about?" Julia came down the stairs and popped a salmon in her mouth, then bit into a tofu. I was impressed, it was ingrained in her.

"Then, when you finish, you eat a chilli pepper to burn off the taste of everything" she said.

"Really?" That sounded kind of weird.

"No" Julia ate another tofu, "Mom's just being all weird again, she's teaching you weird things, don't listen to her, everything she says is a lie."

Julia's Mom dropped her hands, came over and gave Julia an awkward side hug. "Ahh, you're such a good girl. Did you try on the dress?"

I was amazed by their relationship...they were perfect for each other.

"I'm glad you and London's daughter Lacey go to the same school. You two used to be such good friends when you were smaller. Tomorrow make sure you go and say Hi to Lacey, she seems like a really...energetic girl"
 
That was one way to describe her.
 
"She's a pain, she's so mean" Julia said.

That was...another way of describing her.


"Her Mom's real pretty and an excellent cook" Julia's Mom said. "I think if you try to be her friend then she will appreciate it as well"

"Mom, you don't know Lacey, at ALL." Julia threw down her hands, "She's like three atom bombs falling on my face at the same time."

I laughed.
  
Julia's Mom didn't find it funny. "Julia, that's a horrible thing to say, take it back now!" 

"Mum, you're just protecting her because of your own reasons, she's just the cause of a lot of misery at school, everyone hates her. Colita had to go to her and apologize."

Julia's Mom turned to me, "You went to her place to apologize?"

"Yeah...kind of...yeah" I didn't really want to talk about it, it was a bad thing to happen.

"Everyone at school has their own cliques and they all make up lies and scandals to protect each other, it's so stupid, I just want to be finished with school and get out. All their reasons for doing things are so shallow, once you look at them to the bottom there is nothing there."

It felt weird for me to be standing here watching them, but I couldn't just leave. But I couldn't stay either. Reasons are shallow once you look at them to the bottom. Look over the well and you will be literally astonished, not by how far down it is, but because the bottom of the well is right there, it's just that the water was covering it completely so it was unclear. But it's so close that you will be surprised that you didn't recognize it earlier.

"Julia, that was a great comment" Julia's Mom said, "See, you're learning so much at school"

"Mom! How many times do I have to tell you that I don't learn ANYTHING at school."

Julia pulled me up to her bedroom. She started complaining and whining about school, not just Lacey, but everything else that was going on in her life.

I listened silently for a while, not knowing what to make of it. "Julia" I said, "Is this why you're always trying to...harm yourself? Because of all of this pent up negativity?"

"This isn't negativity" she said, "It's just my feelings"

"Yeah, well they're all negative"

"Oh, I'm sorry Ms. Know-it-all. I'm just trying to release what I'm feeling so that you won't complain about me anymore"

"What, when did I complain about you?"

"I know you're always talking to others about me, saying mean stuff."

"I don't ever. What would make you say that?"

"You don't like me anyway, you probably think I'm annoying and a pain to be around"

"Julia" I grabbed her shoulders, "Don't you EVER think like that, that's very dangerous, if you think that then you are alone. I don't think you're a pain, I think you're a wonderful friend."

"You just think I'm a risk and a liability, if I die then it's your fault."

I couldn't say anything, she was too far gone. 

"You told me that we're just evolved" Julia grinned, her middle teeth showing. "I'm just a failure to evolution that's all" she said. "Others are stronger than I am. Mum and Dad only love me because they have to, because I'm their daughter. Otherwise they wouldn't care about me. No one does. I'm just someone's genes."

"No, you're important" She was saying what I always said, and without knowing it, I had influenced her so much. "Don't say that anymore"

"Why not?" Julia sat down at her desk and brought out some of the homework. "You say it all the time, how it's all a process of evolution, I'm just repeating it. Why don't you agree with me, is it because of me? Because I'm saying it?"

"No, it's not"

The next day at school Lacey made fun of Julia's Mom. She and a few girls found us by the lockers and circled us with their arms crossed and their expensive bags hanging from an arm in between us.

"What did you say about me?" Lacey said. "I know you guys were talking about me, so say it to my face now"

Julia was always silent at school. 

"How do you like the dress? I'm surprised that a pig like you can even fit in it." The other girls laughed. They played their part well, they laughed on cue and stopped laughing on cue. It was a complicated job that only a few in the world could do, and they were good at it.

"I want to let you know that I got something better, it's perfect for me, but I won't tell you, just in case you want to steal it off me again"

"Your Mom was so fat too, that's why she couldn't recognize that her daughter's also fat."

That was it, Julia slammed her locker shut. She grit her teeth in anger.

"What? You're not saying anything? Pigs can't talk but they can Oink" Lacey dashed around to her friends, she stood with a foot out, talking and bringing Julia down lower and lower.

Julia finished packing her bag and walked away without a word. I had to rush to keep up with her. "Get lost Lacey" I said, "You're the worst"

"Shut up skank" One of the girls beside Lacey piped up, then she looked to Lacey for confirmation. Lacey nodded her approval and looked back down on me.

The next I saw of Julia, she ran into the bathroom. "Mom told me to be kind to Lacey but I can't. Can you believe that we used to be best friends when we were this small?" She put her hand just above the ground. "She said we used to play together, but look at Lacey now. She's a monster"

"She's just jealous of me and you" I said. 

"Why would she be jealous of me?" Julia said, "I've got nothing to compare to her, she's prettier, more popular, and also good at school."

"Because she sees you have a friend" I said, "She thinks she is better than you, but you have a real friend that she doesn't have"

"And who is that?" Julia said.

"Julia, you really don't know? It's me"

"Oh" Julia said, "Of course I knew"

I didn't know it, but Julia had swallowed a TON of sleeping pills during that bathroom break, halfway through class she fell asleep at her desk. The class found her unconscious. I had to run to the nurse's room with her. I took her into one of the bathrooms and used my angel powers to heal her. 

Afterwards I felt so tired. Recently I had been using this power so much that it was really draining me. Julia felt no embarrassment at killing herself in front of the whole class. She felt no shame in making me work this hard for her. How come I was the one feeling more embarrassment than her? For what she was doing.

But the only person she couldn't tell was her Mom.

I was annoyed that she kept using me like this. I had done everything just to bring her here. I wasn't even supposed to be using my powers.

Julia came to, her eyes blinked and opened. She looked up at me, then beside her at the tiles right next to her head on the bathroom floor. They were colored a light yellow and a light blue. One strand of her hair flowed into a drain at a slight angle so the water would leave.

"You saved me" She looked up with a big smile. "You really do care about me."

"Julia, this is really getting tiring, I'm sick of you doing this, now at school as well. Is this all a test from you for me to show you how much I care for you? If it is, then all I can say is that you're sick, this whole thing is sick. Messed up, messy messy messy."

"Was I dead in class, at the desk?" she said. "I was right? And you dragged me all the way out here. That's so sweet, but I hope no one found out." 

"Don't do it again" I said. "Is it because of what Lacey said? You don't need to care about what she says, it doesn't mean anything anyway. Next time I'll argue for you, I'll make her stop saying horrible things to you."

"No, don't. Mom told me to be kind to her" Julia said, "That's why I didn't want to say anything to her, I didn't want to argue back, Mom really likes her."

"Your Mom doesn't know how she's mistreating you, you need to go to the school counsellor to sort this out. What she's doing is verbal abuse and bullying. If your Mom knew, she'd be appalled at Lacey's behavior and she wouldn't ask you to apologize."

"Its useless anyway, to say anything to her."

"To who"

"Both of them"

"Why will it?"

"It will just hurt her" Julia said, "I don't want anyone else to be hurt in this world. Not my Mum, not Lacey."

"But she's hurting you"

"But if I say something back it will just hurt her, so it's useless"

"Julia, but you can't let yourself suffer like this"

She brushed her hair on the tiles, then heaved a breath and sat up, using her arms behind her to help her sit straight. "I've suffered through all these years" Julia said, "I can suffer for more, it doesn't change anything for me, it doesn't matter. So if I can suffer and stop my Mom from suffering, or anyone else, then my life is worth it."

She brushed off her skirt and stood up, leaving me crouching on the floor and looking up at her.

"After this, right now I have no remorse and no boundaries are holding me back anymore, I'm feeling incredibly free." 

Julia walked out of the bathroom.

### Chapter Twenty Four - Matt the Beast 2

During lunch I sat at the table with a tray full of two people's lunch. Julia sat opposite me with nothing.

I didn't bother asking her why. She'd probably just give me some excuse and want more attention from me. So we just ate in silence.

Then the chair next to me slid open and a young handsome man slid in. 

I knew who it was, it was always Nathan

"How are you doing recently?" Jason said.

I did a double take, "Jason? What the flip! I never expected you here." We didn't talk since that time out on the field. I pretty much hadn't seen this guy around school at all.

Julia was already silent, but she became even more silent. I felt her shoes brush against mine under the table. Julia was blushing like a rose that had just been plucked and was offered in its fresh entirety.

I gently nudged her toes. I had almost forgotten that she had a crush on Jason. 

"Hi Jason" I gave him a wave, even though we were close he better get used to it. 

"Wow, what's with the sudden change of attitude?" Jason grinned, "I like it, it's sexy"

"Are you Nathan?" I said, "Leave the perverted jokes to him okay, one guy is enough. " I set my utensils down and put my hands flat on the table and turned my whole body towards him. "So, Jason, to what do we owe this pleasure of your attendance?"

"We're going to the movies on Friday" Jason said. "You and Colessa want to come along?"

"No thank you" I said. Friday night was my turn to watch Matt. "Who's we?"

Jason looked puzzled, "Me and Matt of course, who else?"

"Oh...in that case, I'll go"

 Jason frowned, "You girls are all the same, you hear Matt's going and then suddenly change your mind. Do you know Lacey's coming as well?"

I looked across at the popular kids' table. Matt was hardly visible underneath Lacey's hugs and kisses, but he was there all right. 

"If I have sex with Julia will it make you jealous?" 

"What!?" I turned to see Matt grinning down at us. He grabbed the chair on the other side of me and sat down with the back of the chair under his chest. He leaned forward, letting his fingers gently slip over the frills of my skirt, he was delicate like a paintbrush. 

"Is that how you say Hi?" I grunted, "You're despicable"

"I'd rather be despicable to you than liked by you" Matt said. "So answer my question, would you be jealous if I have sex with Julia?"

Julia reddened like a beetroot straight out of the can. "No, no, I won't" she said, "I would never."

Matt laughed, "Of course you will, I'm the best guy here, Jason is second, no one can resist us."

Soon Lacey joined in as well. She made sure to come right in between Matt and me. But Matt ignored her like she was a piece of dust.

I guess he was wise, we all eventually did turn into dust, his foresight was AMAZING.

I pinched his fingers and moved them off me, like a power shovel maneuvering its grasp of soil. Like a broom swiping the dust off a surface.

"These fingers" Matt moved in and held his fingers in front of my eyes. "They've touched you everywhere." He emphasized it like a tiger hunting its prey. "You're mine, I've seen everything from you so you can stop pretending to act proper and be the slut you are." I could feel the heat from his breath on my eyes, but it wasn't warm, it was a cold chill that ran straight to my heart.

"You're disgusting" I said. He had always been a jerk, but now he was seriously the worst. Dissing me for something that I thought he had enjoyed as well. Why was he acting like such a dork? Did he secretly like Lacey a lot, and was bringing out the anger on me? I just didn't understand why he had such a strong need to put me down, just like Lacey was putting Julia down. I felt a hand on my shoulder, I looked up and saw Nathan. He came up beside me and stood in front of Matt, angling him down.

I gripped my fists and released all the tension in my shoulders. "I don't care? You can do what you like?" I tried to hide the weakness in my voice. If Matt heard a hair of weakness he would clench onto it and pull it out. Matt was the last person on earth that I would allow myself to show my weakness to.

"I don't care? You can do what you like?" Matt repeated it after me and laughed. But he was alone in his laughter. Jason was beside me, and Nathan was also beside me. Julia had become silent, she didn't want anything to do with this. Even Lacey didn't want to interfere in front of Matt.

"You're so jealous" he said. "I'm going to have sex with Julia right now, right here, and you can't do anything about it."

Julia looked up at me in fear. This guy was a complete beast, and what he was saying was outrageous. There was no way that something like that could happen, we were in a fricken school. Everyone was watching his actions, the teacher's wouldn't allow it.

"No, I won't" Julia said. It was the first thing she had said at all.

I felt movement beside me, Nathan pushed Lacey out of the way and stared at Matt. He wasn't as tall, but his eyes were scary and full of anger.

He spoke through gritted teeth, "You aren't going to lay a finger on these girls. You're the worst form of life on this planet. I'm ashamed to be a man, I'm ashamed to be a human where you are. I don't even want to see you. How can you say such a disgusting insulting and rude thing to a woman? Do you have any sense in your mind?"

Nathan was so angry, his fists were clenched and ready to fire. But Matt didn't budge, he knew that no matter how angry Nathan was he still couldn't harm him. Matt was just too strong.

Then Jason came up as well and stood next to Nathan. 

"I know I'm your closest friend, we grew up together and all, but just chill man, this is no good. See everyone? It's a bad idea, let's just back off and leave these girls alone."  

Matt stepped up to Jason, with the two of them facing each other it was clear that Matt was much bigger. He was wider and taller, he could break Jason in half and throw him away like he disposable wooden chopsticks. "We grew up together" he said, "That's why I won't hurt you now, but you have to move out of my way." 

Jason stood strong. "Recently you've become a menace, you're not the Matt that you used to be." 

"I'll poison you" Matt said, "You're my friend so I'm taking it easy, but if you stand in front of me, I'll make you regret it. I'll poison you and burn your fingers, I'll snap your tongue so you can never touch or pleasure these girls again."

Lacey's eyes widened, she stared as Matt spoke. Even she didn't know where his violent thoughts were coming from, what had instigated them? Was Matt always like this?
He turned to me, "Slut!" he pushed Jason aside. Jason fell over like a feather. "Slut, what are you looking at me for? Bring Julia here"

The people who were standing around Matt moved away from him, but they still wanted to watch. A large circle formed around us. Jason on the ground protecting Julia from Matt. 

"I'm not what you guys think I am" Matt whispered. "If you try and stop me I'll screw all of you up. Do you think I'm just playing around everyday?" He turned around and looked over the crowd, "You lot are all the same, every one of you is an idiot. If a pretty girl comes and asks you to hurt someone you will, because she is pretty and you're all scum. You'll do her a service because you think you're special and everyone else is dirty. You'll pretend to be someone more important than you actually are, all because you're sad loners with no girlfriends. You'll cover you naked bodies in expensive clothes and have your parents dress you up as the latest doll. You'll let your pet tiger devour your true feelings so it can grow up to protect you on its gold chain.

"Matt, what's wrong with you?" I said. "You're messed up, what kind of a sick man are you?"

The circle around us grew, more people were watching, and everyone wanted to be at a safer distance from us.

"You and Julia are making a low growl of hatred. Both of you are fakes." 

Matt walked over Jason and came to Julia. He grabbed her by the collar and pulled her towards him, turning to drag her out. The circle opened as he walked out with her in tow. Julia was screaming, even Lacey had blended in with the crowd, she was nowhere close to us.

"Stop!" I screamed and gripped my fist. He didn't respond to anything, I was going to have to be violent. I threw a punch at him with full force, but before it could connect A hand blocked me.

"You're not touching him" The hand had huge rings on, and the palm swallowed my fist. It was Colessa, she had run in between us and was stopping me. "I cant let you hurt Matt."

"Do you see what he's doing?" I said, "He's trying to rape Julia!"

Colessa looked puzzled for a second, just for a second. She crushed my first in her hand, she was much stronger than I was. "I can't let you hurt Matt" she said.

"Than make him stop!" Julia's cries were right there, we were in a school, what were the teachers doing? "She can't recover, she won't recover." If this happened to Julia, in the middle of the school with everyone's knowledge, she wouldn't recover, she would never ever heal.

Matt was still walking off. Colessa finally released me and I ran up to punch him, I kicked his knees until he let go of Julia. She collapsed on the ground and cried out loud. The crowd followed us closely, but not wanting to interact, they kept their distance.

"I'm sure you two are in love" Matt said. I noticed that his fly was almost undone, his pants were sagging. "I've had enough" He ruffled his hair and walked out.

The crowd suddenly ran forward to help us. "Are you okay?" They said, "He's really a beast, he's horrible" Julia sat crying amidst their attempts at comforting her. They gave her a big hug that swallowed the both of us. Even Colessa joined in.

But one member of the crowd ran on, she left us and ran after Matt. 

It was Lacey. She guessed which way he went and ran after him like a fly chasing after a trail of food.

In the big hallway, everyone was saying something about Matt, everyone was saying something about Julia. I sat there hugging Julia, her trembling body, her torn temper, her ripped breathing. Hands all around us touched us, wanting to let us know that they were close. Hair and breathing and voices were all around us. And in the middle of all of this, was Julia. She had just stopped breathing again.

Why was this happening?

No one knew, what was it that Matt wanted?

---

### Chapter Twenty Five - Julia the Spectacle

Julia had stopped breathing. I tried to grab her through all of the hands and talking and take her somewhere private. Everyone wanted to know what I was doing with her.

"She's unconscious" someone said, "Let me see her."

"No, I'll take care of her"

"She looks dead" someone joked, "Wow"

It took something like this for them all to step in. I grabbed something, anything I could find, a history textbook, and flung it around. "I'm taking her, everyone back off" I grabbed her and ran to one of the empty stairways before they found out what was happening. I took Julia out of all the commotion. Her head was hanging down with her arms, her body was already turning cold, like a stone. Even the limbs weren't as flexible. I didn't know what had caused it this time, did Julia swallow something? Had she been hit in the wrong place?

But...she was dead.

I set her down on the cold gray painted concrete, the rails were still sounding from the  people walking past above. I ran to shut one the doors behind us. 

"Colita took her in there" some girls behind the door said. "What's she doing."

I opened the door and asked them to stand guard. "Can you guys make sure no one comes in? Julia's just in a bit of a shock right now, is that alright, do you think you can do that?"

The girls looked at each other nervously then nodded. They were a few grades younger than I was, they shouldn't know what was happening, even someone my age should never have to deal with death this closely.

Because I had healed Julia so many times, I knew I was spiritually exhausted, my healing energies could only go so far. I could heal her this time again, but what about next time? Or the next after that, if Julia kept this up, no amount of healing would do.
This time I held my necklace, trying to make it glow with energy. I heard voices outside, "Is Colita in there with Julia? Let me in." 

It was Colessa, I knew it was. She wanted to see if I was healing Julia or not. If I was, she would make me lose my job of being an angel.

As I clutched the necklace, the glow grew stronger. The girls outside told Colessa that she couldn't come in, then Colessa argued back with them about needing to come in to make sure Julia was alright.

"Please work quickly" I said to myself, "Please work, come on, come on, come on!" I kissed the necklace and felt the energy flow to my lips.

Then, amidst all the noise outside, the people walking in the floors above us, and the cold concrete ground against my fingers.

I felt a shake, like a door was being pressed open, a strong force of energy was moving it out, trying to step in. It broke my concentration, I spun my head around, I swear there was a presence around us. But nothing. The girls were still holding the door, and upstairs everyone was walking past.

I could have felt there was someone, or something watching us. Nothing like I had ever experienced before.

I kissed the necklace again, then put my lips on Julia's. I held that for a while, trying to feel the energy again, it took more effort but it was happening.

The door behind me opened and I knew Colessa had slipped in. She watched as I kissed Julia on the lips, waking her up. I kissed further, nudging her tongue with mine, biting her lips gently, massaging her whole mouth in an embrace. Then, after a few times, I finally let go and stood up. Julia's eyes were already beginning to open. She was half smiling.

I looked over to Colessa. She stood with her hands crossed, staring at me with a stern face. She didn't say anything and walked away. Colessa turned around and walked out, I ran over to her "Colessa, wait up" But as soon as I got out the door the crowd came in through the door

"Where's Julia? Is she here?"

"Is she okay?"

Julia was fine. Her eyes opened, she turned her head on the ground and looked over to her school classmates running in, watching her in concern. A few of the kinder girls came up to her and gave her hugs and kisses. "I heard what Matt said, that was so horrible, but don't worry, you have us now." 

I left Julia with the girls and ran out to pursue Colessa. I got through the crowd and saw just the back of Colessa's foot at a corner.

"Colessa, please wait!" I ran after her like I had never done before.

I got to the corner, then saw that the theatre door was open, this was the backstage entrance. I went in, it was much darker, but the stage was left lit up. "Colessa? Are you in here?"

"I'm here" she said.

I found Colessa sitting cross legged in the middle of the stage. She had her arms in a meditative position and was looking up towards the roof of the auditorium. Rows and rows of empty seats stretched upwards and towards the roof. 

"One day all of these seats will be full" Colessa said. "Do you believe me?" She didn't look at me when she spoke. There was no indication that she cared I was there.

"Look, I'm sorry Colessa" I said, "It's just that..."

"Do you believe me? One day when we are much older, we will see all of these seats  full, and they will be filled by angels and humans equally. Not just one or the other, but by both. Angels will be sitting side by side right next to humans. No one is complaining about the other, and they can live in harmony." She sighed and let her face sink to the ground. "It was just something I thought would be nice, that's all."

"It's possible" I said. "That day is soon approaching"

Colessa shook her head, "Colita, why did you do that? Have you been doing that the whole time?"

Her voice was quiet but it echoed through the whole auditorium, clinging onto her lips, and then bouncing off the walls around us. If anyone was sitting here they could hear us talking at a distance.

"I was just healing her Colessa" I said. "She was dying"

"Then let her go" Colessa said, "It's none of your business, if a human wants to die, it's not our right to keep them alive."

I was wordless, how could Colessa disregard Julia like that? "Julia's a life! She's a real feeling person with red and blue blood gushing through her veins, isn't that enoughr reason to keep her alive?"

"But it's against the rules" Colessa pressed on her knees and stood up. She faced me with a sad face. "We're not allowed to heal those who aren't on our mission, you know that important rule, yet you still broke it." She shook her head, "Colita, I really liked you, I thought we could get along so well, we already were..."

"Max will understand" I said, "If I tell him what was happening..."

"Colita, look at the time, do you see the hands on the clock?" We gazed up at the hands ticking together. She spoke with each movement of the hand, "There goes one second, there's another, and there's another." She dropped her hand and looked at the floor. "One short moment of hellfire is enough to make you forget everything you value in life and want to escape from the pain. You'll want to throw away everything you have instantly, if it relieves you of the pain for even this moment." Colessa turned to me, "But you do realize that you will be suffering not for just a moment, but for eternity?" Colessa put her hand on her mouth to stop herself from crying, "Colita, an angel who broke the rules, a fallen angel, will go..." She pointed down at the ground, the solid ground of the stage. But she couldn't bring herself to say it, she ran towards me, embracing me with so much energy and love. "Colita, I like you so much, I've grown to like you, I don't want to not see you again."

"Am I really?" I said, "Do you think even me, even I will go down to..."
"Don't say it" Colessa covered my mouth with her hand.

"I was just healing someone I cared about, someone who should be able to have their whole life ahead of them" I said, "That's not a bad thing right?"

"I don't know, you broke the rules, I don't know anymore" Colessa gripped me tighter, "We can only pray. We can only pray and hope that it won't happen, you'll be fine. But I'm sorry Colita, I have to tell Max. If I don't then they might punish me as well."

"Don't mind that" I said, "You do what you have to. "I'm sure God won't be so unkind to me, I had good intentions"

Colessa raised her head and looked at me in the eyes, her mouth was blue from the veins right near the surface of her skin. "I don't know" she said, "I don't know, I hope so" She was in so much distress that we could hardly talk. I never knew she cared about me so much. I always thought she was just another person that happened to know I was an angel. I didn't think she was special or any different at all.

Colessa turned to me with tears running down her face, she closed her eyes and excess droplets were squished out, joining the stream under her nose.

"I'm sorry" she wiped her face and her runny nose. "I just never thought this would happen, or else I would have warned you"

"No Colessa, you're a good girl" I said. "I can take care of this, it's okay"

"I'm upset" Colessa said, "Because I want angels to be treated the same as humans, but it's not possible, as soon as we try to do anything it's rule-breaking, or someone gets hurt. I want to believe that we can all be equal"

She ended her sentence and her last words echoed around the room like ping pong balls. There was a pause as I tried to soak what she had said into my mind.

"Colessa, that's not what I saw. I always thought angels are different from humans, and the two of us can't bond together, it always ends up like water and oil. That's what I always thought, but when you came and made best friends with everyone in school, I felt like I was wrong, and you had changed my view of the world. You showed me a possibility of humans and angels living in harmony. I realized that it was  actually just me who is antisocial and unable to relate to others properly. People only talk to me because I am attractive and powerful. Lacey made me feel this way, she only talks to me when her power is threatened. But I realized it is true, I felt the same as she did, only talking to others because of power."

Colessa whimpered, her arms still around me.

"Sorry, I got off topic" I breathed in, "What I want to say is that Colessa, I think you've got a really good attitude, and if you keep showing it to everyone, then equality between our races is not a dream anymore, it is actually happening."

Colessa whispered in my ear, "Think of the humans, they have it a lot harder, they can't shapeshift and can't heal, they have to live with what they got, they can't change it, yet a lot of them are so resilient and strong, we should look up to them."

She took a breath away, then came back to my ear. "That's what I think whenever I feel weak or down. In the end, all of us angels, every one of us just wants to be human. It's that simple."
She moved her mouth towards mine, "The only difference between us is what we can do right, it's just healing right? Humans can do it and we can't" She let go of me and ran around the stage. "That's all, that shouldn't be a reason for difference" She gripped her fists and spoke to me, "That's ALL it is, it's really nothing if you think about it properly, why do we make such a fuss over everything, this healing power, it's nothing, it's so small compared to the importance of our lives. I want to laugh when I hear that we are being separated from humans because we can heal."
 
"But it's a huge difference" I said. "Really big, too big to conquer with equality. But I agree with you, it shouldn't matter. Who cares if we can heal or can't heal, we still have the same feelings, we have the same ambitions, and we fall in love with each other."

"No way, I don't believe it. I look at how things are different, and it makes me sad. When we are in the angel areas, then I feel like everything is going well, everything is pleasant, it's the most wonderful feeling. I can look anywhere, talk to anyone and know that I fit in completely. They respect me, and I respect them. But then we go on a job, and I become so depressed and sad" she said, "Because suddenly there is a separation, a big separation, that shouldn't be there."

"Colessa, that's why we have to hide that we're angels. That's why the rule exists. Otherwise we could all tell each other right?" 

I let my fingers touch hers, I went over and hugged her. "I know why you're so popular Colessa, it's because you're just a genuinely good person. I shouldn't have been born an angel, I'm not kind like you are, and I always think bad thoughts about others, human or angel. Even when I don't want to, they just come to me so I don't think I deserve to be an angel."

Colessa rubbed her hair, "You are who you are, you were born this way, so don't think it's a mistake, our Creator loves you. He may be busy, but he loves you a lot"

"But we're not human." I said, "Will God still love us then? I sometimes feel like us angels aren't seen by anyone, we're just wandering alone and trying to jump into a spotlight to garner someone's attention, otherwise we will be left in the dark for eternity."

"It's no different who you are" Colessa said. "God loves everyone"

"How do you know?" I said.

"Who is busier, Santa or God?" Colessa asked me. 

"I don't know, they're the same"

"Exactly" Colessa leaned in and kissed me on the lips. At first it was a touch and a swipe, but I responded with care and the urgency of a teenager.

Which I was...I guess.

"I hope Max won't be too upset at me" I said. 

Colessa didn't answer, she just kissed me harder, rubbing her hand on my breasts over my shirt. She came closer and wrapped herself around me so that I lost balance and fell to the floor. The wooden stage echoed with a thud.

"How many times have you healed Julia?" Colessa said.

"About five" I said, "Maybe more" I didn't want to go into the details of her suicides and her depression.

"You must be getting exhausted then" Colessa said, she went out, then moved her waist above my stomach, rubbing herself against me. "How many more times can you do it?"

"About five or six" I said. "Ahh, that's nice" She stuck her hand down my pants and was massaging me.

Then I remembered when I was last healing Julia, I felt the presence.

"When I was healing Julia earlier" I said.

"You should have told me" Colessa said, "I feel a bit betrayed by you, I felt like you were doing stuff behind my back"

"I wasn't" I laughed, "Don't worry"

"Well I'm going to have to do extra work here, to make up for myself" Colessa pinched my nipples and circled them. She slowly moved my shirt up.

"Well, when I was healing Julia, about halfway through the process, I felt like someone or something was watching me" I said.

Colessa stopped suddenly, she stood up above me and looked around. "You were doing the revival process" she said, "It's a hard procedure, I'm surprised you can keep it up for so long."

"But what was that thing watching me?" I said. "I know it was watching"

"Death" Colessa said.

The hairs on my back ran up, my legs stiffened. Colessa's hands didn't feel so warm against me anymore.

"Sometimes, when a person is due to die, Death itself will come and inspect what is happening. Maybe because Julia was supposed to die a long time ago, Death came." Colessa saw my shocked expression and tried to laugh, "Don't worry silly, it's just a long angel legend from the old days, of course it's not true."

"Okay" I held her hands tightly and moved them over my body, "Okay, good" 

We got closer and closer and closer.

But still managed to finish before the next class started.

---

### Chapter Twenty Six - Julia the Diligent

That night Max called me with urgency.

"I heard what you did" he said.

"I understand I broke the rules, but it was to heal a friend. Did Colessa tell you the full story."

"Colita I can't tell you who told me, it's a code of confidentiality, but you know, you know it doesn't matter, it's not important anyway. I will have to talk to the council about this while we decide on an appropriate forthcoming punishment due." 

I pouted, he didn't have to act so cold towards me. He was always like this, as soon as I did something that might threaten his position, he acted all high and mighty and afraid that he would be blamed. It was obvious Colessa told him, why couldn't he just admit it?

"Is that all you have to tell me?" I said, "Did you call me up for that?"

"I want to say, you're doing a great job, I'm going to come over on Friday..."

Beep beep beep...

I hung up. Whatever he had to say wasn't going to be important anyway.

I called Julia afterwards. It rang, "One, two, three, four, five, six"
She picked up on the seventh ring.

"Seriously Colita, why do you always call at the weirdest hours."

"I was just checking"

"Well check at a proper hour" she hung up.

"See you at school tomorrow" I said.

I fell asleep with the necklace in my hands. I held onto it importantly. I hoped that Max would pull me through, even after I was rude to him. I had heard of angels losing their jobs after things like this. If it was really serious, then I wouldn't get away with just losing my job, it was a betrayal of the essence of 'angelness'

The next day at school I was glad to see Julia. She hadn't come to homeroom, so I was standing on the side and watching things that were happening. Then I heard her voice talking to some girls in the corridor. She saw me and threw the girls away. 

"Colita" she came up to me and started unwinding her sleeves.

"What's up?" I tried to ignore my life and all its trauma, right now I wanted to be with Julia. She needed my help more urgently, I tried not to be selfish.

She rolled up her sleeves and showed me the scars discreetly. I rubbed my hand over it but she pulled her arms back. "Careful, I don't want everyone to see them" She rolled up the other sleeve as well, then showed me more scar marks. 

"I thought that when you healed me you would heal these as well" The scars had hardened into lumps on her skin. "Otherwise I wouldn't have made the cuts so deep in the first place." She looked up to me with a pleading look, "Please? Can you get rid pf these? They're sooooo embarrassing, it's like I'm some kind of monster or something."

"Julia, when I heal you it makes me feel like some kind of monster or something"

Julia looked at me and smiled, "Come on, you're always helping me, just this once more too, okay? I can't walk around with others seeing these scars."

"Julia, when I heal it takes a lot of energy, I would like to reserve it for more important things. I'm not supposed to use it so freely I was told off last night..."

"Who cares if you were told off, it's just once, come on. You've done it so many times you can't just stop now, I'm already relying on you." She took me to one of the empty bathrooms and held out her hands in front of the mirror and closed her eyes "Okay, I'm ready now, you can start"
"It's not that easy" I said, "I shouldn't...it's for emergencies" The healing power wasn't something to be played around with. I was to use it on Matt, and Matt only.

Colita is so happy to hear Julia's voice. Julia yells at her in complaint. Colita collapses and says she doesn't have the energy for this anymore. Julia needs to stop committing suicide.

"This is an emergency!" Julia said, "Come on" She was getting groggy, she stamped her foot and tried to make me come forward. "I'm going on a date with Nathan on Friday night. He's the second hottest guy in the school okay? I have to look perfect for him."

"Nathan? he asked you out?" I thought Nathan only had feelings for me, he always was interested in me. I didn't know he would ask Julia out.

"I'm so excited" Julia sat down on the counter and held her arms out for me. "Come on, hurry up and heal me"

I stared at her arms, the scars running across were of all lengths and sizes, in different directions and of different depths. They created bruised protrusions on her skin that stuck out like collections of rubbish pieces.

"Julia, I thought you didn't like Nathan?"

"I didn't" she said, "But he said he asked me out because you weren't interested in him."

"Oh, really?" I pulled out my necklace, wrapping my fingers around it. "Is that what he said?"

"He said you are like a chameleon and goes closer to everyone else around him as well." Julia moved her legs against the floor, in a fast tempo. "He said that when you slept with Matt he was shocked and didn't want to believe it. So he said he asked you about it?"

"Mm Hmm" I nodded.

"Then he realized it was true, and said he went down screaming" 

"What? Julia, how do you know this?"

"The other day at morning tea he told me, he just came all out and confessed to me, isn't it great? I've never had a guy like me before so I'm excited"

"But Julia, why are you telling me this?" I held my necklace and eventually put it back under my shirt. Was Julia telling me this deliberately in order to make me feel bad. Would that make her feel better about herself?

Julia frowned, "Colita, if you give me the necklace, then I can do it myself, you won't use any energy and it will be easier for the both of us."

"Julia" I said, "It doesn't work like that, you're not an angel, the necklace is just an accessory to focus my energies." But what she was basically saying was that she didn't need me.

She tried to talk past me, "If I can just do this, then my whole life will change" Julia said, "It's not a big deal is it?" She stopped as someone walked past and stared at us as I held my necklace out and Julia had her sleeves unrolled. Julia hid her hands momentarily then brought them back out once the girl was gone.

"Julia, if I couldn't heal you, if I had none of these powers? Then would you still come and talk to me?" recently it seemed like the only reason Julia was around me was because she wanted to be healed, we never really talked about anything anymore. 

"Of course not" she said, "Remember I first became your friend without knowing anything about you? I'm not going with Nathan because of you, I'm his rebound okay?"

I was disappointed to hear that Nathan had been so upset about me. I never expected it, he always was nonchalant and easygoing, I couldn't imagine him serious about anything. That Nathan would feel any real emotion was beyond me.

"Why do you think so lowly of him?" Julia said.

"No, he thinks lowly of me" I said.

"Whatever" Julia unrolled her sleeves and did the buttons back up. "You're not going to heal me are you, because you're just some selfish stuck up angel who doesn't care about me at all."

"Julia, I healed you so many times"

"Yeah whatever" Julia waved me off and walked away. "I won't expect anything from you anymore"

Later I found her in the classroom, she was reading her textbook diligently with her sleeves covering every part of her skin. She looked up and saw me entering then stuck out her tongue. 

What was I supposed to think of that. Julia you're a great friend?

I caught sight of Nathan but ignored him. He didn't tell me anything anymore. He was standing with the boys, joking about something that happened. He turned around, I waved, but he didn't see me, he was looking past me. I turned my head and saw Julia waving back. Once she finished, she looked at me and stuck out her tongue again.

Lacey walked into the classroom like a bacteria. I suddenly felt like sneezing. She scoured the room looking for people to pick on, finding someone to bring down.

Her eyes settled on me.

"Colita?" she fake smiled, "How are you doing"

Oh no, I could hear the JAWS music playing, thump thump thump thump. The shark was near.

"Hi Lacey" I gave her my very-own-personally-fashioned-fake-smile. 

We understood immediately what was happening.

"I heard Julia was asked out by Nathan" Lacey said.
"Yes, she's lucky" I lied. Actually I think I felt left out; but any show of weakness in front of Lacey was death, she would take it and squeeze it until every last drop of you was gone.

"And by the way, I'm meeting Jason later" Lacey said. "So..." She trailed her fingers across my desk. "I just wanted to let you know that Jason's off limits as well"

"You have Matt" I said. "Why are you with Jason?"

"Because I'm pretty enough" Lacey flicker hair. She used the opportunity to make sure no one was watching, which wasn't happening since Lacey was always seen. But relatively few people were watching, and when Lacey turned back to face me her smile had changed into a snarl. 

"Prettier than you" she said. "We're meeting behind the auditorium during lunch break. You know, just to get close." She flicked her hair again, then her expression settled down into one full of relaxation. 

"Why are you telling me this?" I said. "Are you trying to make me jealous? Because it's not working, I don't care what you do with Jason."

Lacey put a finger to her lips, pressing them in and letting them bounce out, it was an erotic gesture.

"I'm sure you know who I am" she said. "I love the attention, and I'd love to have you know your place"

I didn't get to talk to Jason or Nathan. Matt was a monster, he just sat at his desk and did his work quietly never talking to anyone. I had no idea what went through his head. Did he even have feelings?

But it was my turn to watch him, so I did. No one had attempted anything on Matt yet. Nathan seemed to have nothing to do with this whole thing. Max must have been wrong.

Then during one of the classes, I heard that Julia had been taken to the nurse's room. She was unconscious. One of the girls in the class told me. I immediately got up and made an excuse to go to the nurse's room.

As I thought, Julia was dead. She had died five minutes ago. But the nurse didn't know, she thought Julia had fallen asleep from fatigue. "She's just tired" The nurse was mixing all sorts of things around, wiping tissues, and cleaning utensils. "I'm really busy, you guys are friends right? Do you think you can wake her up or something?"

I closed the curtain behind us. Julia looked really peaceful. She lay there like Snow White waiting to be kissed. I guessed that made me a...prince in shining white armor.

The necklace started glowing, I gathered my energies and kissed Julia on the lips. I immediately felt tired. I would need about an hour to rest.

When Julia woke up, she looked at me over her and smiled. "I knew you'd be here" Her eyes barely opened beyond her lashes, but she looked happy to see me there. "When we're like this, I know that you love me, you really care about me don't you."

"Why do you keep doing this Julia?" I whispered to her. The nurse was right on the other side of the curtain. "Why do you have to go this far to believe that I like you?"
"It was an accident this time" Julia said, "I swallowed too many sleeping pills, I didn't mean to do it." She watched me looking at her closely. I touched her cheeks, running my hands down her face. 

"I can't do this anymore" I said, "There's a limit, even for me" 

"I'm sorry" Julia said. "I'm sorry to make you go through this" She moved on the bed, pressing her arms beneath her to lift her up. "I'm not depressed though. If you think I am, then you're wrong."

"Right"

"You don't believe me do you?"

"I believe you, you're fine, that's why you keep committing suicide all the time."

"Shh" Julia looked around, trying to make me speak quietly. When the tension disappeared Julia grinned and laughed, her teeth were the color of a pear, a healthy yellow.

Then she broke down in tears. They came endlessly, like a rain that had no cause, washing through the city and drenching its citizens, making them complain of catching a cold or having to miss an important deadline because of the traffic.

"Colita you're so popular, I'm just a loser."

"No, that's not true, Nathan asked you out. He must like you"

"No, it's because I lied to him, I said that you would consider come along to our date. Everyone just sees me as a means to get to you. I'm just your tail that everyone tugs on to get you to look."

Julia was crying and confessing, and even though I wanted to see Julia telling me the truth instead of acting like she was fine, it hurt me to see her like this. Was it either a perfect porcelain sparkling girl; or a bundle of old clothes that were soaked through?
 
"You're unsure" Julia said, "You've never met someone like me have you. You've healed me so many times, but look what I am now, I'm like a Frankenstein that's been sewn up so many times that I don't even know what I am." She breathed out and let out a trifle of tears before being able to continue. Her warm breath soaked into my skin, leaving dots of water vapor on my neck and on the metal band of my necklace.

"I really admire you Colita. I admire you so much that I can't help being jealous of you. I'm so so jealous of you do you know?"

I didn't want to hear this again and again. When she told me this, how did she think it made me feel? Did she want me to sympathize with her and hate myself? Or did she want me to reject her and reprimand her.

What did she want?

"Why do I have to be the one depressed? You don't feel sad ever, because you're an angel, you can just heal all your problems away"

"You said you're not depressed though" 

"I'm not, because..." she said.

"I'm not" Julia said.

"It's not like that, I feel sad sometimes too, actually I feel sad a lot of the time, more than you would think."
 
"But you just feel it sometimes, I feel it all the time, I wake up in the morning, then 
go to sleep at night, I feel sad before I even have time to think. Every action I do takes so much more effort, just to greet people and say hi is so mentally draining."

"Julia..."

"Am I draining you?" Julia tried to bring me forward closer to her but I refused, I held back. Julia's arms full of scars moved over my arms her skin was rough. Battle wounds.

I couldn't tell her that I also felt guilty. Jealousy was probably like an argument, it was probably never one sided. Her jealousy was probably also caused by me, I don't know how, maybe I didn't show enough care and respect to Julia.

Julia looked up into my eyes, trying to read my thoughts. But I couldn't offer them to her. She was holding me tight, I didn't feel comfortable anymore.

It always went both ways. I felt her bottomless sorrow and drained confidence, she was free-falling without anyone to catch her. She was already falling for years and deteriorating. 

Was there anyone to heal someone else? It should be me, because I was an angel. But there has no one to heal me. If I committed suicide like Julia always was, then I would be long gone.

"You're lucky Julia" I said. "You're lucky to be a human"
 
"I'm not lucky" Julia said, "The only way I can stop being jealous is if I'm closer to you. That's why I do all of this, all because I want to get closer."

"Oh sweetie, why didn't you just tell me then?"

"There are things that you can't say with words" she said. "That's why you write about it, or sing about it, or draw it, or else just do it"

"So your death is like making a work of art?"

Julia sat up, she came close to me. "Are you ready to kiss me now?" she said.

"Will it make you happy?"

"Yes" 

I closed the curtains a bit further and shuffled on the bed to sit sideways. Julia also moved next to me.

"Did you reassess your life?" Julia said, "Are you ready to kiss me?"

"Sure, let's go"
Julia dabbled her lips on mine first, then she drew back. 

"Is that all I get? A peck?"

"No" Julia giggled, "Here I come!" She dived in, 

"I'm so glad to have you as a friend" I said, "Believe it or not, you've taught me so much"

"Stop talking, I can't kiss you like that" 

I agreed, and we kissed, getting louder and louder. More and more intimate, I was enjoying it more and more. Today was good Julia. 

Sometimes I didn't know who she was. Whether she was in a good or bad mood. Which Julia would turn up.

### Chapter Twenty Six - Julia the Diligent

I was upset to find out that in an hour, Julia had died again.

It wasn't even funny. I was fuming as I marched over to heal her. Seriously, I was still tired from healing her just now. My lips still felt wet from her saliva.

I found Julia collapsed under the big school fountain, it had our school's logo written above it in neon lights. The fountain was marble white with angels in different poses around it. By angels I meant fake angels, what humans thought angels were. these were all pretty little cute marble figures doing different things, shooting arrows (for some reason humans thought angels shot arrows, actually I had never touched a bow and arrow in my life).

Someone said that she was just holding her breath.

What kind of person holds their breath underwater for so long?

I was kind of glad at their cluelessness. If they knew what was really happening it would be commotion.

I went in the water and took Julia to one of the corners of the school and placed her on the grass.

"Are you guys going to kiss?" A guy yelled out, "That's hot"

"Get lost" I shouted. I moved Julia even further away and breathed in to start healing her.

When she finally woke up she didn't smile. She got up as soon as she could and pointed a finger at me. She marched towards me angry like a birthday candle that refused to go out. 

"Why don't you just let me die?" she said.

"I thought you wanted to be close? I'm doing all this to save you, why can't you appreciate it? Just an hour ago you were saying you wanted to be closer."


"Let me die in peace already" she said.

I saw a guy suddenly look our way.

"We're rehearsing a play" I shouted, "Shakespeare!"

"Shakespeare doesn't say that, I know every one of his plays" The guy said.

"It's the modern version!" I realized I was messing with the wrong guy....Urgh, who read Shakespeare anyway.

He grinned, "Okay, sounds depressing"

I had given Julia's excuse. Why was there an audience everywhere? Why was Julia so clingy one moment and then cold the next?

Julia said, "You don't like me right? So why are you healing me? Love isn't worth anything, it's just something you're genetically predisposed to, so why does it matter? You've saved me three or four times now, so there, it doesn't work. Just give up, I'm still broken."

"Being broken might be something beautiful in itself, it depends on how you perceive it and how you fill the gap that was broken. Besides, you need to stop talking about evolution like it's everything."

"But you're the one who's always saying it" Julia said, "I'm just repeating after you"

She was right, I was a hypocrite. But we all were. "If you keep saying I don't like you, then stop making me heal you"

Julia shouted, "I though it would be nice if you did like me."

"Then don't ask me to heal you next time you keep on giving up."

"I won't! You don't have to!" She banged the grass with a fist, but it stood straight back up after she let her fist go.

"Then stop being depressed, it's annoying to me as well."

"I'm not depressed, you're just annoying." Julia stood up and wiped her knees. "Colita, thank you for healing me, I really appreciate it"

"I'm saying this because I care about you, you really need to stop. What would your mother think?"

"She doesn't care about me" 

I took her sleeve and held her back. "Don't you dare say something like that, I've never seen a mother who cares more for her daughter than your Mom."

"She doesn't know anything about me, it's easy for you to say. We argue all the time when I get home."

"Then you should tell her about your life, every parent wants to know how their daughter is doing."

"I try, but she just yells at me"

"Stop Julia, we need to talk" I sat her down. "Please promise me you won't do it again, we can't keep going on like this. I won't help you next time."

Julia said, "Sure, I don't want to live anyway, why do you think I even try to die? Stop reviving me all the time and let me go." 

She said that, but I knew she was actually happy to have my company. It was the first time she had ever been so close with anyone. She cried and cried because she couldn't enjoy life. She couldn't enjoy the life she was given. She would never be as pretty, or smart, or popular as any of the other kids, she thought she had no talents either. I understood her more than anyone else did.

"Is that the problem?" Colita says

"No, that's just something else I'm talking about. Feel like I'm getting closer to you by doing all of this again and again."

"But I'm really tired of it, Julia you've done it again and again. I don't know how much longer we can keep this up for."

"You're all I have Colita" Julia's attitude changed, she showed her weak self again. "Without you I'm really nothing, no one cares about me"

"So many people care about you Julia."

"No one truly loves me, you don't either"

I didn't comment, I didn't know the answer to that. Whether anyone really loved someone else was beyond me, it was beyond the world's best philosophers. But I was an angel, I was born to keep people alive. In this life that was my talent so I had to use it to be the most useful that I could.

Julia leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. I couldn't resist and kissed her back on her forehead. Quickly our lips touched and we were at each other again. 

I had never touched Julia in this way. I ran my hands down her uniform, unbuttoning the top with one hand and caressing her gentle hair with the other. With her shirt undone her bra was exposed. I went beneath it and felt her nipples, small hard buds like fruits on the end of each hill, supple and anticipating something, anything.

"That feels good, keep going" Julia said. "I've never been touched like this, I'm not usually that kind of person."

"You can touch me too" I said, 

Then, "Please touch me."

Julia listened to me and leaned forward, her legs were big and fat like tree trunks, and her stomach was wrinkled like a balloon with no air as she tried to comfort me. "How's that?" she said.

We touched each other, but that was enough, neither of us wanted to go any further. "Julia, if you really want to go, oh well, maybe I'll just let you"

Julia's hands stopped on my thighs. "No, don't do that, I don't want you to leave me, I'm not lonely, I just want someone to help me"

"You realize this is your life?" I said, "You only have one life, you have many other things, other things are replaceable, but this is your life, it's one of the few things that you can't replace, ever. If you do go, then how do you think I will feel? I love you so much, can you stop doing it, for me?"


"I've thought about all of that" Julia said, "I'm sorry, I'll try my best"

"Okay" I sat up and did up my shirt. My whole body was heating up in excitement, but I didn't want to do that to Julia, it wasn't fair.

"What did you see...after you died" I stood up and tied back my hair with a strand of grass.

"Do you want me to tell you?" Julia said. "What do you think?" She suddenly became cheerful, she knew she had something I wanted.

"I'm asking you, I asked you first"

"What are the options?" she also tied up her hair after picking out a strand of thick grass.

"Is it that difficult to answer me? Come on Julia. Was there a God and did your soul carry on to meet Him? Or was there nothing?"

"I'm not telling" Julia smiled. "You will find out one day"

"You have to tell me" I wriggled her arm, "Pleeeeaaaasssse, it's not fair."

"Why?" Julia said. "You will find out one day anyway"

"Because knowing this will change the way I live right now" I said.

Julia looked at me sternly, "You can't do that Colita, you need to live your life properly with trust, not just change it because you know the result. That's like knowing the answers to an exam before you do the exam."

"True" I shrunk my shoulders, when had she become so wise? 

"Besides" Julia said, "What if we see different things? Wouldn't that be scary?"

"That would be the worst"

Julia nodded and put her bag on. "Yes, that's why it's better not to know"

I put my bag on after her. 

I always knew this, Julia only knew a few things, but those things she knew, she knew really well. And when she set her mind to them she never gave up.

She had tried to die twice today, it was getting really dangerous.

### Chapter Twenty Seven - Julia the Shadow

During lunch break Lacey and Jason disappeared as planned. 

But then Jason reappeared. He had a big worried look on his face.

"Colita" he said, "Colita, come and help Julia"

I groaned, "What is it now?" This guy only talked to me when he needed something. It wasn't annoying, it was just annoying.

I ran with Jason to the arts area on the first floor. It was almost always empty here, even the arts students didn't study here.

Matt was holding out his hand, and next to the wall was Julia, her hair was caught in a jumble. No pants were off, so I guess we were safe here.

"Colita!" Julia screamed and ran towards me. "He's being so mean to me"

"Can you not?" I said, "I'd like you to leave Julia alone. What kind of pathetic person takes someone so far just to interrogate them?"

Matt closed his eyes slowly. When he opened them his eyes were red. "I will do whatever I want" he said, "I thought Julia wasn't human, so I was just asking her"

I led her away from Matt. Seriously, what was wrong with him, was he taking drugs? Even drugs didn't make you act so crazy right? Jason followed us out. 

He shook his head, "Matt's been acting really weird recently, I don't know what's gotten into him. He keeps saying that there's some people who aren't humans here."

I froze...was he looking for angels?

"What's wrong Colita?" Jason said.

"Nothing" I changed the topic smoothly, "Didn't you have to meet Lacey?"

Jason remembered and smiled, "Yeah, during the second half of lunch, I asked her to go to the auditorium and lie down with her eyes closed. I was going to give her a surprise.

"A surprise?"

"Shh, I can't tell you either" Jason grinned. He was kind of cute when he acted nice, even if it was to Lacey of all people.

Julia and I had lunch together. Nathan or any of the guys never joined us. Colessa walked past and said she had to watch Matt. She eyed me and made me feel guilty for making her do all the work.

"I'll do it tomorrow, I promise"

"Has Max told you what might happen yet?"

"No" I shook my head, "Not yet"

Colessa exhaled, "Good, I hope it's nothing too big"

When I looked back to Julia I was smiling.

"What's so funny?" she said.

"Nothing, I just never knew I was such close friends with Colessa until recently."

"What? How did you become friends, what did you say, what do you talk about with each other?" Julia leaned over with her head in her palms. "Tell me"

"Maybe next time" I said.

I went out to the gym. I was thinking of watching Nathan play basketball, becvause the other day we were supposed to chill together but it didn't happen because we were both busy.

He was sweating hard, because he made most of the dribbles. I was surprised by how good he was. He had never told me, I thought someone like him would brag about it. Maybe it was just because I was another girl to him who he didn't have to show off to. The other guys tried their best to stop him, but whenever he was in a pickle he just passed it to someone else.

Wow, he was good. I was impressed.

"Colita?" There was a whisper. I looked up to see Mel.

"What do you want?" I entered my defensive mode. This girl was on par with Lacey, they were both the worst.

"Julia, she's asleep"

I shot up. "Where? Tell me where"

Her eyes widened slowly, then she nodded and looked past me at one of the boys walking past the gym.

"Uhh...at the auditorium" I said.

"Isn't Lacey at the auditorium?" I said.

"I saw Julia there as well, Lacey wanted her gone."

I could understand that. Whenever these girls needed anything done they came to me, they didn't even talk to Julia about it. I was their first choice.

Mel led to me to the auditorium, on the way I took out my phone and called Julia. I let it ring once, twice, three times, four times...

"Who are you calling?" Mel said.

"Julia, she promised she'd answer."

"You trust that girl? Are you guys like good friends?"

It rang five times...

"Six..."

"We're almost there, you can hang up" Mel eyed my phone. 

"No" I held onto it.

"Seven...eight..."

We stood in front of the auditorium, 

Nine rings, there was still no answer.

"She's right there, you don't need to call her"

Ten...

There was no answer. The phone asked if I wanted to leave a message.

I thanked Mel and ran in, even though I wasn't thankful, even though I couldn't think straight. Again I went through the backstage entrance and entered the stage. Lacey was lying on the ground face up with her eyes closed, and beside her was Julia, also lying with her stomach upwards. There was no Jason. There was no audience.

"Julia?" I said. There was no response, both girls didn't hear me. They both looked like they were asleep, although the corner of Lacey's eyes twitched abruptly, she remained still.

"Jason..." Lacey smiled, "Is that you?" She squeezed her lips for a kiss

"No" I said, "It's Colita. Why is Julia lying next to you?"

"Oh" She sounded disappointed, "I'm keeping my eyes closed waiting for Jason, so if you don't mind, can you leave?"

Of course, if it was Lacey there was no possibility of a correspondence without poison in the mix. "I'll move her" I said. But when I tried to get down to move her I fell over. I lay on the ground with my head sideways on the floor.

"Did you slip?" Lacey still had her eyes closed, "Serves you right"

It wasn't like me to slip on a flat floor. Then I felt my muscles trembling, I could barely keep it together.

I crawled over and put my finger against Julia's neck. It was cold, there was no pulse pumping through her body. Her blood was stagnant in the same place, just like a pond.

"Julia" I said, "What happened this time"

"What?" Lacey said.

I held onto my necklace, preparing to make it glow. I unwound Julia's sleeves, seeing the marks on her wrist and up her forearm. She said that every time she attempted it she marked herself so she could count. It was like a tattoo to her. But did she realize that I had to heal her, so I saw her scars more often than she did? I was the one that had to revive her.

I knew that if she woke up now it would be the same, she would be crying and upset and begging me for some solution. And I would talk to her and try to talk her out of trying to die. 

I breathed deeply and gathered up courage to stand up, my necklace was still glowing strongly.

"What's wrong with you, you sound like you're having a heart attack, stop breathing so loud. Seriously, it's like kinda annoying to have someone breathing over my neck all the time." Lacey said, "What are you even doing here anyway? Can you go somewhere else? I'm supposed to meet Jason here alone"

I stared at Julia, all sorts of thoughts were colliding in me.

I remembered when Julia's Mom told me in the car about when Julia was born, she cried, then she sat down silently. Julia's Mom laughed and said that it was just Julia thinking deeply. Julia yelled at her Mom and told her to stop. Then her Mom said, "It's a sign that you will be someone great and able to change peoples' lives when you grow up" 

It was a side to her that I never really knew, only her Mom would know. Julia had depths to her, everyone did.

But Julia didn't want to live, she had committed suicide three times today, each time saying that it was an accident. But no one commits suicide so well, so consistently. She obviously didn't want to live. Her and life were not compatible.

Besides, my energy was strating to wear out, it was affecting my ability to socialize during school hours and I found myself sleeping more during the night. I couldn't talk to Nathan properly because Julia was always making me running around.

Julia lay there still, next to Lacey, they both had their eyes closed and in a meditative position. I don't know how Julia had got here beside Lacey. But like this they both looked like they were just asleep. If I called out to Julia with more warmth and kindness in my voice, then maybe she would answer.

I slowly reached down and touched the hem of her dress, where her legs touched and branched off from the material. Her skin was now cold, like an ice cream that had been left to freeze overnight. 

Nathan had asked Julia out, even though he said it was to get closer to me, I still felt a bit upset by it. And whenever I tried to live my school life, then Julia was always right there needing attention and kisses, always wondering where I was and making me go over to her place to heal her. That wasn't what a high school life was about, and because of it I was making Colessa work harder as well.

Not to mention that all of this was breaking the sacred rules that an angel had to abide by. I was NOT allowed to heal others outside my mission, if I was found out, I would be severely punished. And if they found out that I had still used my powers after being warned by Colessa and Max, then I would most likely be fired. Hardly any angels had broken the rules, I would be one of the few who had.

But as I watched Julia, I saw her Mom asking me to help Julia, "Julia doesn't have many friends, so she's really happy to have someone like you, if you could help her enjoy school that would be great. Sorry to ask so much of you"

I sighed, I looked at my necklace. Why did I have to have this power, why did it have to be me who decided on someone's life. That shouldn't be my responsibility, I didn't have the right for that.

No one knew how much I was doing. 

All I had to do was revive Julia, and then we could talk and chat about things as usual again. Julia wanted to come back, she always said so right. 

But when I remembered it I felt tired.

Lacey's voice cut through my thoughts, "Are you still there? Get lost already before Jason comes."

I kissed the necklace, it glowed in excitement, but I let it fall back onto my breast. "It's enough" 

"Julia, it's enough"

"It's enough Julia"

"It's enough now"

"You've done enough already"

I kept on repeating it quietly, maybe to convince myself I was doing the right thing, or maybe to try and forgive myself for my actions. Or to let anyone watching know that I was trying.

"Julia, you can rest now, you've done enough already"

I stood up  and walked backwards away from Julia.

"Goodbye Julia, Julia goodbye."

Lacey shuffled nervously. I think she was falling asleep. Even a girl like her found the peace to sleep.

I retreated to the stage, not knowing what to do. It still wasn't too late to heal Julia, if I did it now then everything would be back to normal, there would be no change.

I stood on the edge of the stage, the audience seats were below, all folded shut, peering up at us. If anyone came in, we must have looked like the end of a Shakespeare scene.

Then, I wasn't sure if it was imaginary, or if it was real. But I thought I heard one of the seats in the auditorium rise and empty. Then when I turned away to face the audience, maybe or maybe not, a door shut.

Death had finally satisfied its hunger and then gone.

### Chapter Twenty Eight - Julia the Lump

"Who was that?" Lacey said.

"What?" Turns out she wasn't asleep.

"Did someone just open a door?"

"No, they closed it" I said.

"Who left?"

"I don't know, it's better not to know."

"Is it Jason?"

I stopped talking for about ten minutes, and lay still. Julia, Lacey and I were there. Except, Julia was only a shadow now. I didn't want to think about it, I couldn't. I went over and silently crouched over Lacey, then I dipped down and placed my lips over hers.

"Jason?" she said. "Mmmm" She pressed against me and we started kissing, the saliva on my tongue dripped down around her mouth and she licked it up. She kissed my lips as well. 

Our heads started moving closer, my nose right next to hers, and I knew she could see me blinking. We kept on kissing, she moaned and I moaned. 

"You're not Jason" she moved her hands around my waist and pulled me up so my breasts were pressed against hers. "Only Colita has a body better than mine"

"Shh" I cleared her hair away from her eyes and put my hand on her cheek. "Just let me do this now" She was pretty, and I just needed to do this now.

I spread her legs out, she was wearing a skirt so it was easy access. I slipped my fingers in and she immediately hummed in resonance. "You're so skilled" she said.

"I lost a friend" I said. "Let me do this" I pulled her panties down, the juices from her overflowed onto the stage, making her slip around as I pressed her.

Meanwhile she still kept kissing me, massaging my breasts. Her legs knees bent to 
allow me into her gateway.

"I'm only easy because you're a girl" she said "Otherwise...Uhhhh, that feels amazing."

"What the?!" Jason came into the auditorium and shut the door behind him with a loud tinge. "What are you two doing?"

I moved away and lay down across from her. Lacey pulled up her panties slowly and smoothed out her skirt, she didn't even look at Jason as she did up her buttons. "I really enjoyed that" she blushed. "More than I want to admit, Colita I hate you, you're disgusting, get off me."

Jason stared at us angrily, his eyes were on me, then moved to Lacey who was still buttoning herself up. "It's not my fault" she said, "Colita tricked me into thinking it was you, she's a slut, that's all she's good for."

Jason kept staring, he completely ignored me.

"Lacey, do you realize that Colita's an angel?"

My heart dropped, this was some sort of mistake right? How could he know about it?

"What?" Lacey looked at me with enormous eyes in shock. "Colita's an angel?" She got on the ground, forgetting her buttons, forgetting everything, even Jason. She immediately bowed down in humility and apologized to me profusely.

"I'm sorry" she said, "Don't hurt me, please, I didn't mean to do anything wrong, I'm sorry for trying to make you feel jealous"

"What are you talking about?" I laughed, "What are you talking about?"

"You're an angel" Jason said, "Stop pretending like you're one of us, we all learnt about angels when we were younger, you guys pretend to be us and infiltrate into us to destroy us."

"What is that?" How did they find out, who told them? Was it Colessa? My gaze tipped over to Julia, dead on the floor...or was it Julia?

"I'm sorry" Lacey was so scared, she kept talking to herself and to me, bowing down and begging not to be harmed. "Don't hurt me please, I'll do anything"

They obviously didn't know what an angel was, that an angel is harmless, they are only there to help people. All they feel is fear. 

"I know you're an angel" Jason walked up to me even more angry than usual. "You were lying to us this whole time"

"Don't go close to her" Lacey said, "She'll hurt you"

Why did Lacey believe Jason so easily, we were kissing just now, why was she suddenly so afraid of me? Did she not trust me at all?

Jason stood in front of me and reached in my shirt to pull out my necklace, "That's the sign that you're an angel, you were pretending to be one of us the whole time"

"Stop" I pushed him back, but he was strong and didn't move. So I pushed him again, harder, I pinched his arm and tried to make him go away. "Don't touch me!"

"I won't ever touch you again, if you just show us the necklace."

"I won't show you anything" I said. "Go away" He finally backed off and I crouched down and started crying. Why was all this happening, what did I do wrong? Why was he so mean to me? I was just trying to be nice to everyone, why did it have to be this difficult.

"See, I told you she's an angel, she's too afraid to show us anything, we'd better tell the teachers quickly."

Lacey stood up and ran to Jason, she hid behind him and stared at me. "How did you find out?" she said.

Jason spoke loud enough so I could hear, "I was the last one walking through the hall, then a guy walked past from the opposite direction from the auditorium door."

"What guy was it?" I said. 

"I don't remember, I can't remember anything about him, only that he didn't look...human." Jason pointed to Julia, "What's wrong with her?"

He ran up, but saw me walking closer and walked away. "Don't come any closer" he said. 
He walked off backstage with Lacey in tow.

After they were gone I stared across, Julia's body was still lying there. I went over and touched it, it was cool and comfortable like an air conditioner on a hot and sweaty day.

Then Jason came back in with Lacey.

"Hey angel, did you kiss Lacey?"

I nodded. Then he fumed...

As he was backing off he tripped over Julia's body and fell backwards. Her flesh sunk in just like a lump of apple pie, a few bones cracked and the middle moved like a folded up mattress that hadn't been cleaned in a few months.

"Julia?" Jason looked up, "She's not breathing"

They both looked at me.

### Chapter Twenty Nine - Colita the Angel

"I tried to help her"

"You knew she was dead, and you just left her there, is it because she's a human?" Jason walked up to me in anger.

"I tried to help her" I didn't know what else to say. "I tried to help her"

"You're a killer" he said, "You killed our classmate, just because she's human."

Lacey was shocked. "I was lying right beside her Arghh that's so nasty!"

"She was trying to die, I kept on saving her" I said.

"You didn't save anyone" he said. "You just hurt more people, you never should have come, your kind shouldn't be here"

I outstretched my arms, "Jason, what are you saying? I thought we were friends."

"You never told me you were an angel, you weren't even human and you had me fooled like an idiot." 

"I'm still Colita" I said. 

"What's your true appearance? Are you going to tell me that or lie about that as well?" He picked up Julia off the floor.

I tried my best to help Julia, I tried my best to be her friend, but they didn't see that. As soon as anything happened they blamed me.

"What are you going to do now?" I said.

Jason looked at me then shook his head. He closed his eyes in disappointment and frowned. "Colita, I thought I could trust you, I even had a crush on you for the longest time"

"Nothing has changed" I said, "I'm still Colita"

Jason was still frowning, he sighed "Everything has changed. Now that I don't trust you anymore, I don't even see you as human." He started to smile, "I can do what I like, because I really don't care about you"

"I'm the same" I said, "I'm like a human"

"Don't you ever say that word" he said, "You're not a human and you never will be. You angels should never have existed, I hate all of your kind."

He started unzipping his pants, it took a while for him to get his fly down.

"What about my kiss Jason?" Lacey said.

"Let me just feed the dog first" he apologized to Lacey and looked at me. "Come, give me some pleasure"

I stood up to walk away. 

"If you leave now, I'm going to tell everyone" Jason said, "Come and give me some, or else I will destroy your life."

Julia's Mom's words kept running through my head."You guys go and live your lives okay?" 

"Life doesn't stop for anybody"

As I kneeled down to put my mouth next to it I wondered if he knew about Colessa being an angel. As I moved my head in and out, I wondered if he knew what angels were. And I wondered about the person who had told him, was he kind?

Lacey screamed deliberately. Jason turned to her with an apologetic look on his face, "Sorry, I won't be long" he said. "Just need to get this done first"

Lacey's eyes widened as she looked at me, then at Jason, then at me. "Okay, I'll be sitting outside" she said.

## Part II - The Destruction

### Chapter Thirty - Julia the Memory

Julia's funeral was held in a small garden, a normal place in a normal town. There was nothing special about it, everywhere was something I had seen before, the grass was all over the country, the church was made of small grey bricks and the people were all really sad. 

I was supposed to be feeling sad, but I didn't. Julia was my close friend, but I didn't know any of the people here. They were all wearing black and no one was smiling.

"Colita? Are you okay?" Colessa was also wearing black, a black graduation hat. Instead of flowers, she had brought a bouquet made of vegetables, instead of a bag, she brought a supermarket trolley from somewhere.

"Did Jason make you do stuff?" I said.

"No, why?" Colessa said. "Did he make you do something?"

"No reason"

She looked at me closely, "Colita, you're crying are you okay?"

"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize" I wiped it up with some tissue, careful not to get any drops on the grass, or on Colessa's trolley, or her shoes.

"It doesn't matter, don't mind it" Colessa smiled. "It must be hard for you, you revived her so many times right? How did you have the energy for it?"

"I'm not sad" I stared at my hands, my palm lines ran strong, as usual. It was completely normal. "She was just another person"

"Yeah, but you took on that responsibility all by yourself"

"I will be punished for it" I said, "A vengeance is going to strike on me for disobeying the laws."

"Colita, are you really okay? You lost a friend, it's got to be damaging to you. Max will try to minimize the punishment as much as he can."

"I let Julia die" I said, "When she tried to die I let her go."

"It's not your fault she wanted to die, don't you blame yourself. It's not your fault, it's not your fault" Colessa said.

But she didn't understand at all. We were angels, that was why.

The procession started. Jason and Lacey and Nathan came along and stood together. They hardly looked at me and Colessa. We stood at opposite ends.

When the minister read out the lines, his memory speech, everyone fell silent. After he finished he gave the space to Julia's Mom. She stepped out of the shadows in front of the coffin. She looked at it again and choked on a wash of tears.

As soon as she started her speech little dots appeared on the ground, like sewing holes opening up. Then they speckled the ground like freckles and grew and grew in density until we were all covered in them.

"Don't you have an umbrella?" Colessa said. "They said it would rain"

"It's not raining" I said. "Is it?"

Colessa looked at me strangely, "Come on, hop under my umbrella" The spirals popped up all around us and made safety spots. 

Julia's Mom paused a couple of times to swallow tears, then continued. The audience shuffled around nervously every time she stopped, some brought out tissues and blew their noses. The quiet rustling of the rain dampened everyone.

Then she read the end of her message and took out her mobile phone and put it in the coffin. Because Julia always answered, no matter what.

Almost as soon as she finished, the rain halted as well.

Julia's Mom took out the message again, remembering something that she had forgotten and said it. This was the last time she could ever say anything like this.

Then the rain realized and started again, it kept going until Julia's Mom finished. Then once she had finished the rain stopped and the umbrella's disappeared into their packaging. 

The coffin had its lid placed on it and sunk into the ground. The memorabilia on Julia's tomb said "___________"

Julia had changed from a coffin into a solid slab of rock called a tomb. From here she advanced as a memory through our minds. 

I didn't know Julia very well, I didn't know many of these people. I didn't realize one human would have so many connections in the world. If I died right now, then would this many people come to my funeral? If they knew I was an angel would they come? Max was probably too busy, maybe it was only Colessa who would come. 

"What are you looking at? Julia's that way" Colessa made me look back at the stage. "Julia's there now"

The rain left the Festival to us.

Julia's Mom came up to me. I was afraid that she would blame me for Julia's death. I was supposed to be protecting Julia, but I had caused her death instead.

But she didn't get mad at me, she was incredibly friendly "I'm sorry for your loss" she said, "You two were such good friends, Julia couldn't stop talking about you when she came home"
I couldn't believe her, she had lost her daughter, but all she could think was about my feelings. I had never met anyone as kind as her. Maybe that was her way of coping with it.

But what if she knew I was an angel? That would be the worst. I couldn't bear to imagine how she might treat me different. What if she knew I could have saved Julia? Why couldn't I just have gone in Julia's place? This many people missed Julia, no one would miss me if I left.

I saw Lacey lying right next to Julia again. They were both asleep, but when I touched them one of them woke up, the other didn't move. It all depended...

I saw Mr. Gilbert standing across, he was chatting quietly, when he saw me he turned away. He still felt guilty. Then I looked at who he was talking to. It was someone I didn't recognize wearing all black. Jason went up and greeted the man with Lacey beside him. During the exchange, the man looked at me, then at Julia, then back at me.

He was telling me that he knew. He was telling me I was guilty. 

"I'm sorry" I said. "For your loss, I could have done better, I'm really sorry"

"It's okay" Julia's Mom said.

I couldn't help but feeling that she was blaming me, she lost what was most important to her, a daughter she spent seventeen years raising.

Julia's Mom and I sat down at one of the tables, people kept coming up to offer their condolences. For some reason she was finding time to speak to me.

"I just wish Julia would have told her friends, girls like you, or any of her classmates. I know that if you guys had known you definitely would have stopped her." She shrunk down into the chair, "Because she didn't tell me anything, she never told her mother a word, she needed her friends to support her."

I started to feel more and more guilty, everyone was staring at me and judging me for what I had done and for what I hadn't done. I had neglected Julia at the most important moment when she needed me the most. That moment played back in my mind again and again. Maybe I should have shown her more care, every time at lunch should I have talked to her more? If I had taken more time to respect her and listen to her, maybe she would never have felt the need to do it...

The funeral was over and I followed Julia's mom back to their place. She said she had some of Julia's things she wanted me to have. Some snacks were set up at the table.

"One day I came back from work early because I was feeling exhausted. Everyone at work was just demanding stuff from me and I felt overloaded I just wanted to get home and rest." She took a sip of coffee and put the cup back, circling it so the handle faced exactly the same spot as before she picked it up. She touched her hair a lot, adjusting it with minute improvements, and dabbed at her face, treating her skin like it was lava hot.

"Julia came out from her room and asked me all sorts of questions, she wanted to talk to me but I told her I was too tired and went straight to bed. I had a lot of work to do the next day as well. In my mind all I could think of was work, I didn't even make time for my daughter" She collapsed in her arms. "I wanted to talk to her the next day, but Julia came home late, or something. This kind of thing happened a lot, then I ended up not taking care of Julia." She collapsed onto the table, but still kept speaking.

"After a while Julia stopped coming out to ask me things or telling me about her day, at first I thought it was because she had gotten friends at school and didn't need to talk to me anymore. I thought it was because she wasn't having as many problems with her life. But I was so stupid, I never realized that my daughter had given up on me, her own mother, she didn't speak to me and never told me anything. I never knew that she had been slitting her wrists for years, and I thought she was sitting in her room being a good and healthy girl. I'm such a failure as a mother, I couldn't be there for her when she most needed me."

Her words made drops of tears come to my heart. I was so full of tears that it was making it difficult to breathe. No amount of crying would drain the tears in me.

"Sorry to make you hear all this" she said. "It's not your fault, you're too young to have this happen to you."

She wasn't blaming me, she was also feeling guilty as well, no matter what age you were, this wasn't something that a person should have to handle. A black haired person going before a white hair person. Everyone felt guilty in their own way and handled it differently, but no amount of guilt spread out among everyone would make Julia come back. Maybe Julia's Mom was asking me where and why this guilt was coming.

In Julia's room I was handed a bunch of things. But Julia's Mom kept Julia's most personal items to herself. A photo album, candles from her birthday cake. The teddy bears Julia cuddled with during her childhood.

She handed me a box of things.

"Are you sure?" I said. "This is all Julia's stuff"
"It would be better if these things gave you happiness" I could see she was doing everything not to cry. "She would want you to have them" She turned away quickly and busied herself with the contents of Julia's desk then moved underneath the bed.

"I went through these" she said. "I don't know what Julia did, or how much she used them, but you're welcome to anything."

"Why are you doing this?" I said, "Don't you want to have memories of her"

"I can't leave this room the way it is" Julia's Mom raised her hands in frustration, "I'm going to go, I need to go somewhere different. It's too much to handle."

Everyone dealt with it differently.

"It's not your fault" I said.

Julia's Mom looked at me. "What are you talking about?"

"Julia went out on a date with one of the guys from school" I said. "She told me what happened"

Julia's Mom closed a drawer and looked concerned, "And then..."

"The guy was called Nathan, he's one of the popular guys"

"Mm hmm" She sat down on the desk. "What happened at the date?"

"They went to get coffee at a cafe, then she told me that he got a call after thirty minutes and had to go. But she knew it was a lie, he had organized a fake call, their thinking style was too different. She said it was because Nathan found her so boring he tried to get out of there. She was hoping he'd ask her to prom, so she felt disappointed."

"Julia went on a date with this guy? I never knew. What kind of guys did she like? Did she have certain types? Her father was not the best role model." 

I went on, I wasn't saying this to cheer Julia's Mom up, I just thought it would be important to let her know. "Julia was sad about it of course, but what was worse was that the guy liked me more than he liked her. He was just using her. I didn't know what to do either. But Julia said she went home after thirty minutes and told you that the date was over."

"I remember" Julia's Mom said. "I didn't know she had gone on a date. If I knew it, I would have asked her about it."

"But then she said she went and sat next to you and watched TV. She said she didn't think it was too soon that the date had finished. So she sat with you and watched TV."

Julia's Mom saw the flowers in the window, "Go on" she said, "I'm listening" She re- arranged the flowers, they were withering and the edges had lost their color but she persisted. They were the one memory she would keep.

"She asked you if you ever had a boy you couldn't stop thinking about. And you told her you had a short date with the boy. It was really short because he didn't care."

"Julia remembered that?" She fixed up the flowers and came back to sit on the desk. "That was so long ago"

"She it was soon, a short date. Then you asked her if it was soon. She then said it was soon." 

Julia's Mom kept watching me expectantly, "Then what?"

"That's it" I said, "That's what she told me"

"Julia never told me anything, I didn't know anything, I regret it, if I had known..."

"She really was grateful to you" I said. 

"I was too busy working, I never gave her the attention she needed. Now it's too late and I finally see it. My baby girl. She's..."

"Julia couldn't tell you everything, but to be able to talk to you about that was already important for her. She was upset by what you said but didn't admit it. But that was still important to cultivate a healthy relationship. A daughter can't tell her mother the whole truth, but to be able to have her there to listen is enough to tell her how important she is."

Julia's Mother broke down. She became Deborah. 
But I was speaking from my own experience, I wished that I had a mother to talk to freely and not be judged all the time for my actions. If she just listened to me it would be enough.

Deborah scoured the room and walked to the wardrobe. She put her tissue of tears into the back pocket of her jeans and flipped through the clothes hangers.

"She had so many clothes" Deborah said. "I don't if she needed all of them"

It was like pass the parcel, unwrapping the gift with the anticipation of something being there was the most important.

"She never wore this one" Deborah said, "I'm sure of it, did you know that?"

I recognized the cut and the hue immediately.

The expensive pink and silver dress hanging in the corner was the one she had fought over so fiercely with Lacey. It hung in her closet like all the other dresses collecting dust. Julia's Mom brought it out and showed me where the price tag was on it. The $700 still looked expensive after all this time and the rip on the back looked as fresh as the scars on Julia's wrist had been. I wonder if Lacey still remembered this dress, or had she moved on without any regrets.

"You should try it on" Deborah held it out, "I want to see you would look how in it."

Back at the funeral, the dinner had just started, and everyone began to socialize. Some people talked about Julia, some didn't. Some people who never knew her chose to speak about her, others who knew her the best chose not to. It didn't really matter whether we spoke or not. 

"You must be glad" Colessa said. She saw me sitting loneliness, then she told me now no one would find out that we were angels.

"Now Julia's dead no one will find out about our secret"

"How can you say that? Julia's dead you know?"

"I know, but I'm just trying to cheer you up" Colessa bit into one of the brittle biscuits that were brimming in the tray on the table. "Do you want one?" she said.

"No thanks" I took my headphones out of my bag and stood up. "Jason knows by the way, that we're angels."

"Oh really" Colessa lay down on the grass and looked into the sun. "Wait, what?"

I was gone, I put my headphones on and turned the music on full blast. 

Don't look at me

I didn't want to hear anything anyone said, I wanted to go somewhere far away

Everyday is so wonderful

I never wanted to hear a sound from this world, all the troubles that it had lying in wait.

And suddenly it's hard to breathe

I just kept walking away, until I was right next to the gate. Then I started hyperventilating and sat down next to a tree. My breathing kept getting quicker and quicker, I pictured Julia. Is this how she felt in the end? When she realized I wasn't coming to save her?

Now and then I get insecure from all the pain I'm so ashamed

I fell down, but the music kept playing, it stopped me from crying. It reminded me that it shouldn't matter what others said, what others did. I was still me.

I am beautiful, no matter what they say. Words cannot bring me down.

I took out my necklace and tried to save myself, get out of this mess. To help me stand.

I am beautiful in every single way

I was ashamed at being here, it was my fault this happened. And it was my fault that I was missing Julia so much right now.

Yes words cannot bring me down.

Then finally the tears came. And I started bawling. I couldn't hear myself, I could only see the sunlight shining through the leaves in tiny polka dots.

So don't you bring me down today.

### Chapter Thirty One

With a little persuasion I came out with the dress in full bloom. Deborah saw my necklace on the surface and made me take it off. "Don't wear that" she said, "I want to see you in only Julia's clothes." I put my necklace aside. Then Deborah sat on the bed and looked at me look at myself in the mirror.

"You're so beautiful" she said, "You're a really gorgeous girl."

Without the necklace on I felt like a complete and utter fool of myself. But I also felt like a complete and utter human. Was this wonderful feeling of being marveled at how human girls always felt?

"You're more beautiful than Julia was" she said. "A lot more. I'm her mother, but that's why I know, and I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm open minded enough to say it."

I was shocked "That's a really horrible thing to say about your own daughter. Especially now that she can't argue back." 

Deborah sighed. "I know, it's just that you know her better than I ever did. Here," she picked out the withering flowers from their vase. Inside the vase was another vase of the same size, then inside that vase were the withering flowers. The stems were a lot longer than I expected."Why don't you try putting these on like this?" She held them in front of her with a pose and then gave them to me to do the same.
I was already wearing the dress and did my hair meticulously, but when I walked into the room Julia's Mom was writing down some things vigorously on a piece of paper. When she saw me she handed me the paper in excitement "These are the things Julia used to say, can you say them as well?"

I hesitated, wasn't this going a bit too far. I mean dressing up as Julia was one thing, but to even say what she said?

"Sorry if it seems weird to you, I just want to remember her, so please?" Then she took Julia's photo standing on her desk. Instead, she got a photo of me from school and slipped it in the album.

"What are you doing? What is that photo"

"Is this okay?" she said, "I just want to make it more natural?"

"Is that okay with you? This is Julia's room I've got nothing to do with it, why are you replacing everything she has?"

"I'm not replacing anyone" she said. "I'm replacing my sadness, or I'm trying to" she said. "Your name is Colita" she said, "But what if I call you Julia?" 

"You're trying to forget about your daughter? I thought you loved her?"

"No, no, gosh no, I'm trying to remember her. A name shouldn't be the only thing we care about. I want to call you Julia, and you call me Mom okay?"

"This is so messed up, I can't do this" I started to take the dress off.

"Men and women are culturally raised, but both feel the same emotions, they're the same, it just depends on how they're treated as they grow up. Just like you or Julia, you're just different by name."

"But we're all unique and different aren't we? That's why you're sad that Julia's gone aren't you?"

Deborah sighed and walked over. "Colita, that's exactly what I'm saying, what if I call you Julia? Then will you get a different perspective of the world? What if I said you were a man? Then would things change? The way we see things now is really limited because of the connotations with who you are. If we change your name, even temporarily, we might be able to see things differently; even just for a while or a bit. What if instead of Julia's friend I were to know you as Julia's cousin? Or even a stranger?" 

She got an apple from downstairs and brought it up and put it in my hair gently. "That looks good there, it's a healthy hairband."

"This is Julia's dress" she said, "The one she insisted on buying, and when you wear it I get to remember Julia a bit. It's very sad for me, but it's something I need to do okay? So please indulge me."

She smiled and caressed my hair and smoothed it out so the apple fit perfectly, "Then it's not such a far stretch to say that you're my daughter is it? Then I start to wonder, why do I treat my daughter differently to anyone else?"

It was strange, but I kind of understood her. She was full of conflicting thoughts, but there was some method in it.

"So, Mum" I said.

Her eyes widened slowly, then grew smaller. "Yes Julia?"

"How about older and younger people?" I said. "Is there a difference there?"

"Of course, they're the same right? I can't think why you would even ask that."

"Good" I said, "What if a person looks exactly like a human and acts like a human , but can do a bit more than a human can?"

"I don't know what you mean by a bit more" Mom put a finger to her lip, "I guess that's the same as being a human isn't it? You ask such different and unique questions. Do you think you're not human? Do you think you're not loved?" 

She stepped back and took a photo (Draw picture of Colita wearing the dress!!!!)

"Okay" I started to take it off. But she jumped forward and put her arm on my strap. "Not yet" she said. She stood in front of me silently, then she kissed me.

"What are you doing?" I said

"This is also what I do with Julia. Sometimes she came home and she wanted me to kiss her, so I did it like this" She put her lips next to mine and closed her eyes. "Then I lick all around her mouth to clean it from school." She did exactly what she was saying.

I opened my eyes, they were wet. "I'm not Julia" I said, "I'm Julia's friend. Please don't confuse the two."

"So let me replace her for a moment, doesn't it feel different?" she said. She came in and kissed me again, this time with a bit more passion. Before I noticed it her hand was on my waist.

"Please don't do this" I said.

"It's really what I did with Julia" She sat me down on the bed. "Julia always asked me to when she was lonely"

"This is sexual abuse" I said, as she smoothed out the strap on my shoulder and then wound it down my arm. What if they had really done it? What if that's why Julia had been suffering? Was this something that even she couldn't tell me?

"Just relax" she said.

"You're betraying Julia" I said. "She wouldn't like this, just imagine what if everyone in the world was free of these things, it would be such a great place."

"You are Julia" 

"But Mom"

My breasts slipped out of the garment as Mom rolled it down to my waist. She touched my breasts gently and let them rise. Then she kissed me more, her warm body against mine, moving up and down, breathing heavily.

I moved her hair away and kissed her back, then I kissed down her neck and slowly over her breasts. She stopped me right before sex.

"I never did that with Julia" she said.

"It can be our first time Mom"

She shook her head. "We can't cross that line, sorry" She got up from the bed and put on her underwear.

When I walked to school, I thought about the dress. I thought about Julia's Mom, and what she said had made a little bit of sense. I wondered if my pictures were still in Julia's room. I wondered if what we had done would have sufficed to stop her mourning.

Of course not. People went crazy when things happened, then they did messed up things.

But school was the same. It carried on whether Julia was here or not. She had been perfectly replaced. There was a new girl in our class, "Nana" she held out her hand.

I noticed scars on her wrist as I shook it.

During lunch I sat at our table, Nathan joined in as usual, he offered me his condolences for Julia's passing. Then Jason came as well, he said I had to meet him later. He told me Matt would be there as well.

Then Nana came over and sat in the seat opposite me, where Julia usually sat. "Can I sit here?" she said.

"No" I said.

"It's fine" Nathan said, through his mouth full of bread, "She's just joking"

Nana looked at me with eyes that said I like Nathan but not you, you're rude and have a rude sense of humor.

I smiled back to her to say I know and I don't care.

We became best of friends. Nana followed me around and always asked me stuff, I showed her around the school, but I tried not to get too close to her. I didn't want her to rely on me.

"You're so popular" Nana said.

"Hehe..." I smiled but I was crying inside.

During one of the classes the topic of Prom came up. The girls were talking about a prom dress, and then prom dates, and then a prom dress.

Then Lacey told the girls about how her lovely dress was taken by Julia. "I had THE best red and white dress, but you know that girl who committed suicide, she took it from me at the store. It was such a waste, she never even wore the dress to prom, she shouldn't have bought it in the first place." She flicked her fingers, to dry the make-up she was applying to them. "Ugh, that's why I hate selfish people. Can you not take other peoples' things? I mean, really"
I marched over to Lacey's desk with a hot head. She was the only one who talked about Julia, she was the only one who remembered the dress. The exact same thing that I had been thinking about, it felt like a coincidence. "How could she say something like that, it's so horrible."

"What's wrong? She killed herself because she was a loser"

"No, she didn't"

"A fat cow stupid loser like you wouldn't know, so get lost!" she said.

I slapped Lacey so hard that her make-up came screaming off. There was a big red mark spreading across her cheek. She put her hand to her cheek in disbelief.

"Fight, cat fight!" The boys immediately made space and circled us and shouted. The girls surrounded Lacey to make sure she was okay. They looked up at me in hatred. But I was only doing what was right. How dare she insult my friend?

Lacey broke down and started crying like a baby. "She hit me" One of the other girls yelled out and started running towards me with her sharpened nails. She knew where I was through her heightened awareness of the smell of justice reeking off me.

She tried to slap me but I slapped her first.

The guys were hysterical, "Go Colita, go Rihanna, get into it!"

Rihanna landed her next slap on me, then I also crouched down and began to cry. Why were they all ganging up on me. "It was just for Julia" I said. Now that Julia was gone I had no one to support me, no one to defend my actions, no one that I could tell things to.

Then when I looked up Lacey stood above me, half her face was the color of skin, the other half was a thick smear of make-up and hatred.

I put the withering roses on in my hair, and my listening cap.

"You're an idiot" she said. "You've made me look so bad, I can't walk around like this in front of everyone, heal me"

"What?" I pretended I didn't know what she was saying.

"I said, HEAL ME, now!" Lacey stomped her foot. "You're an angel, you can do that can't you?"

I still tried to pretend not to know, everyone in the class was watching, I saw people trying to understand what was happening. Nathan stepped forward, "Whoa, what's happening here, Lacey, you can't just call Colita an angel without any reason to, that's a very offensive to her." 

"It's true" Lacey said, "She has the necklace. And she killed Julia"

The classroom was roaring in silence. There wasn't a single sound as everyone held their breath in unison.

"I don't know what you're talking about" I said. Nathan stepped between Lacey and me. "Lacey, you were just hit, maybe you're thinking too much"
Thank goodness for Nathan, he was a savior, I hoped he would press further charges.

That was until a chair creaked across the room and was thrown out the window. The glass shattered into a thousand pieces and people from all around the room ran into the corner. "That's not true"

It was Matt. It always had to be Matt. He stood up with a temper (Nothing new there) and kicked his desk down.

"You and Julia were the angels" he growled like a lion. "This whole time"

"Why?" Nathan looked at me and tried to defend.

I didn't know what was happening anymore. Why was Nathan in front of us? Why were there so many people talking about angels? 

Colessa came in the room but heard what the class was blaming me of and retreated next to the wall. She held her necklace dearly.

Matt stood in front of me, and wobbled, like a snake shedding its skin. "I know you're not a human" he said. "Julia wasn't either, that's why she died."

After Julia died no one was supposed to find out about the secret, but still everyone found out. How was this happening? Who told them? Was it the figure from the theatre?

Mr. Gilbert came in after Colessa and saw me at the center of attention. 

"Stop it, class is starting, don't bully another student" But his voice was drowned out by the shouting of the class. Everyone was upset about something, but they all blamed it on me. Mr. Gilbert still felt guilty about what had happened between us. I felt guilty as well. I didn't want to argue back with the class, I felt like I deserved it, I had brought nothing but trouble in arriving here. If I did too much now then I would be worth even less. Reticence was worth more than me betraying myself, because everyone is a mystery.

Mr. Gilbert shuffled the students who weren't involved out. But it didn't work, they wouldn't budge, so he saw me as the center of attention and grabbed my hand. "Colita, please follow me" he said. His arm felt weird holding mine, he was really nervous. If I told anyone then his job would be over. It gave me a feeling of tremendous power, his whole life was within my hands. If I just said a word or two everything for him was over.

He knew that, so he was polite to me and handled me carefully, like I was a piggy bank with his most valuable savings inside that might break any second.

All the girls came up to me and told me how Mr. Gilbert is a really respectful teacher and treats everyone well. he is also very helpful with schoolwork and even listens to their problems. The guys never said stuff like that.

He was actually just another pervert. I looked up as he led me out, I saw the bottom of his chin. I wondered what would happen if I started touching him now? Would he get upset because it was in front of everyone.

Guys were all the same in the end. I wished Julia would come back. Things were so messed up after she left. If things could change I would try to treat Julia better.

Colessa stood in front of Mr. Gilbert as he led me out. She blocked the way with outstretched hands.

"What are you doing?" he said.

I made eye contact with Colessa. She was sweating and her fingers were pinching each vertices of the door. "You can't pass" she said.

Mr. Gilbert pushed his glasses up his nose, "Why not Colessa? I'm the teacher here"

Colessa stopped panting, she let her fingers fall. "You can't remove a student who's being bullied from the classroom, they're making up all sorts of lies about Colita."

Mr. Gilbert's grip loosened. "You're right, but this is the easiest way to deal with it."

Jason came up beside Matt, then walked past him and stood in front of Colessa. "Colita's an angel, I was told so, so just trust us and we'll prove it."

Colessa shook her head, "How are you going to prove it?"

"We'll hurt her, and she'll have to heal herself to stay alive'

"Don't you see she's already hurt by what you guys are doing to her?" 

Mr. Gilbert let go and stood back, "An angel? You mean those legendary figures who can heal all sorts of wounds?"

Jason pointed at me, "She's one" he said, "The other one was Julia"

"But they don't exist" Mr. Gilbert said.

"Well prove it to you" Matt came forward with a pen. "We'll hurt her a bit and she'll have to heal herself, then it's proof"

Colessa ran forward to protect me. "But what if she's not an angel?" Colessa said, "Then you're just hurting her"

"I'm sure of it" Jason said. Lacey nodded behind him, "Yes, definitely"

Matt brought the pen closer, punching the bead in and out with his thumb, the sound echoed through the class like a heartbeat.

"If she really might be an angel" Mr. Gilbert said, "Then we would have to say she's guilty until proven otherwise." His face grew grim. "To think that there might have been an angel in this classroom, that's unbelievable, I'm ashamed not to have noticed it earlier. Everyone's been such good students, I can't believe this might ruin it"

"Mr. Gilbert, you sexually abused me" I shouted it loud enough so everyone could hear me. "Last time after we went to Lacey's house I gave you a blowjob"

His hands unconsciously fell to his pants, then he relaxed. "You're going to make up more lies?" He rubbed his hair, "I'm getting more and more suspicious of you."

"He came in my mouth" I said.

"You came in this classroom, just to spread this kind of disgusting rumors?"

He had no morality, not a slice, he was lying out of his teeth but he looked completely normal, like everything that he was saying was the truth. 

"Mr. Gilbert's not like that, how dare you taint his name, I'm going to make sure those rumors don't spread" One of the girls in the class said.

Mr. Gilbert moved aside and Matt came forward. "Do what you need to do to prove that she isn't an angel" Mr. Gilbert said. "I will go tell the principal about this"

### Chapter Thirty Two

Matt cut my wrists and made blood flow. Fresh blood, I screamed in pain. Everyone was watching as he did this. Were humans this morbid and sadistic?

"That's enough" Colessa screamed and ran forward, "Don't hurt her, can't you see she's human?"

Matt looked up at Jason, but Jason shook his head, "She's definitely an angel, and a really good actress as well."

Then Matt pulled down his fly and let his pants drop. The class screamed and went to the corners. Matt grinned and stroked himself, then he lifted up my skirt and exposed my butt.

"Stop it Matthews" Mr. Gilbert said, "That is going too far."

"If she's an angel then she deserves it" Matt said, "No one cares what I do to an angel."

"But she might not be one" Colessa ran up to Matt to stop him, she pulled my skirt down and stood in front of him. "I know you were kissing Nathan" she said, "You're bisexual"

Nathan's hairs rose, he looked at Matt, but Matt wasn't phased. "So what?" he said. He grabbed Nathan and walked over to him. "All these people aren't worth being embarrassed about." He held Nathan's head and kissed him passionately on the lips, then looked around at everyone.

What was wrong with him, the way he was acting wasn't even like a human, it was like an animal. He had no self control at all, no volition, and no respect for others or for himself. He did anything he wanted, and he seemed to hate everyone. Where did this all come from?

"Stop it" Nathan pushed away, but Matt grabbed Nathan's butt and squeezed it, "You like that huh?" he said. "It's just school, don't worry"

Nathan looked around as Matt kissed him, he kissed back and apologized to us, then kissed back and kept moving his eyes around. He eventually shut them to just enjoy the moment.

Matt was a destructive person, he destroyed everything he touched, and when he destroyed everything around him, he turned to himself.

So was the one that we were supposed to protect Matt from, Matt himself? Or was it the person who had told Jason about me being an angel?

Matt finished kissing and wiped his lips. Nathan stepped backward into the shadows. Then Matt's eyes fell on me, his next prey. "I want to destroy you" he said, "Your family, your ambitions, your dreams, everything"

Mr. Gilbert had gone to get the Principal, but the Principal only saw me and told me to go upstairs. "There's a special guest arriving soon" he said.

"The angel's going to leave us" Matt frowned, "How sad"

"Why do you say that?" I said, "Why are you saying I'm an angel"

"Because angels look like you" Matt said, "You all act high and mighty like your life is perfect, but in the end you're not even a human." He came over next to me, gripping my legs and wrapping them round his waist like a huge wrench. "Let me tell you something, I hate angels, all angels. Round angels, square angels, big angels, small angels, if I find any angels I will destroy them."

"Why?"

"You don't know anything about who I am" Matt said, "But just know that I hate angels more than anything else in this world."

Colessa came between us again, she kept trying to separate Matt from me, but Matt kept budging through her. "Leave Colita alone" she said. "I will talk to her about it"

"You're lying, you won't ask anything, you're all liars, now tell me where the other angel, Julia is"

No one answered, even the class was silent.

"Where is she? She can't just have disappeared could she?"

"She's up there" Lacey pointed to the sky.

"Where?" he looked around, "On the roof?"

Lacey crossed her neck with her hand, "She's dead"

Matt sighed, "When did this happen?"

What? He didn't know that his classmate had committed suicide? Was he completely out of the picture? Then how come he still knew I was an angel?

"I was trying to force her to admit it" Matt said, "So I guess she ran away, death probably how far she had to go to get away from me. Good choice."

"Do you have no respect for Julia?" I said. "None at all?"

He shook his head, "Nope"

_Sorry to all you loyal readers, (if this story ever finds the light of day...) The story is getting weirder and weirder, to be honest I kind of lost the plot. I really lacked careful planning and it's not going anywhere right now. I'm probably going to slow down a bit and try to put things in properly. Right now my life is kind of messy, I think I am falling for a crush so hard and I can't get her out of my mind, she's just there 24/7, can't even sleep properly at night because I keep thinking and thinking about her. It's kind of embarrassing...but yeah.
So sorry that the story is weird, I'm jumbling bits and pieces together right now and trying to make Colita find her way._

_What do you think of Matt so far? Pretty much most of him is out, but I'm not going to say anything because I want to see what YOU think...hehehe_

> _Your author_

### Chapter Thirty Three

Jason was conflicted, he saw Matt who was confused and didn't even know that Julia was gone.

"Matt, you didn't know?" 

"Know what?" He looked over at Jason staring at him like he was a cockroach. 

The brand of cockroaches there are much better than the ones we find here. They were easier to get along with.

"You're crazy" Jason said, "You've always been weird and antisocial, but now maybe I think you should get it checked up.

"No" Matt looked at me, "I just really hate angels"

"Julia wasn't an angel" I said. "Don't you dare insult her" If no one stood up for Julia then it had to be me. When Jason spoke up I thought he would say something but he didn't say anything to defend her, it left the responsibility to me.

"A Julia...I mean, an angel would never hurt themselves. If that was why you hurt Julia, then shame on you. You killed her for something that wasn't even true. That's what happened in history and they're all seen as criminals now." 

"You two angels were always sticking together, its disgusting" he said. "I never see you branching out and trying to make other friends. You just live in your own world."

Mr Gilbert came forward. "If there is any doubt about someone being an angel, then we have the right to persecute them" he said. "But right now can you all just calm down. Let me discuss this with the Principal"

The Principal was a white haired man we had never before seen in our lives.

Matt just kept his gaze on me silently. He cracked his wrists and hands. Most of the room vacated after they realized nothing more was going to happen. By I could hear the gossip traveling down the halls. Colessa waved out and said she would try and control it from hitting peoples' hearts too hard.

Matt also walked out, I froze as he walked past me, but he just went past with his hands moving stiffly. His back was set on being dead straight, and his eyes were so cold. I thought he was going to do something to me but he never did, he went past like a normal person.

"You're lucky he's not sure" Jason said, "He's just guessing based on how angels usually act."

Did that mean I was acting different to others? Then how come he couldn't figure Colessa out and thought it was Julia?

Jason didn't leave. "I know you're an angel Colita, don't think I forgot."

"Who said so, are you delusional? Why do you make up all of these stories to put me in trouble?"

Jason stopped me from going past, his hand fell on my shoulder like a gentle feather finding its first rest on earth after a long descent down from heaven. "I still need you to help me" he said, "If you don't want me to tell anyone."

"It's fine" I said, "Don't worry about it much, you're fine"

"I'm not" he pointed down to himself. "Or else I'll tell"

I served him his pleasure in the area behind the school. I didn't do much, he twitched a few times then released. It took a lot longer to clean up from it than anything else.

"Don't worry, I won't tell, just do it next time as well"

"Okay, but don't tell okay?"

Then I saw another guy after Jason left, I recognized him from somewhere. I got scared because he seemed like the one who had told Jason in the first place. He was the one I heard in the auditorium at Julia's death.

He was watching from a distance, I saw him after Jason left, he had seen everything and stood there. But I wasn't sure if it was a person, was it just someone I saw from somewhere else? Was there something there or was it a play of the light?

"Is that Jason?" Colessa was beside me, "Did you do something with him?"

Right...it was only Jason. I don't know why I didn't recognize him.

Colessa looked at my lips, "You poor thing, is that what he's making you do? All these guys huh. How did he find out?"
"Did you tell him Colessa?" I said.

"What? No way, why would I do that, you know I follow all the rules like traffic lights"

That was true. I was just getting unnecessarily suspicious, I didn't know who I could trust anymore.

"The taste of a man's insides is so bad." It was so bad, I tried to laugh it off when Colessa didn't say anything, I was hoping for a response from her.

"That's disgusting" Colessa said, "I can't believe you're doing such a thing with these humans"

"Jason found out from somewhere"

"Found out what?" Colessa's eyes widened, "What did he find out, you have to tell me now"

"That I'm an angel"

"Whhaaat???" Colessa dropped her calmness and became a watermelon. "How did he find out?"

"I don't know, that's what I want to ask you!!! Did you tell him?"

She grabbed me with her other feather, but it was rough, moving the hem of my clothes, "Who told him? Does he know about me?"

"No he doesn't" I said.

"Good, graciousness, good!" Colessa wiped her forehead, "If they knew about me, my life would be over"

In the end she only cared about herself. Then she ignored my troubles and told me about Max. "He's arriving on Wednesday, his flight was delayed" she said.

I had forgotten about him coming at all, "But what do you think about this?"

"I don't know, but you can ask him"

"But then I'll be fired because he'll know a human found out."

Colessa sniffed, "Oh..."

In the end she wasn't very helpful at all, "Do you know what he wants to do here? Max I mean."

"I don't know, but we should prepare ourselves for him" She turned around to address me before she left. "Look, I know you're having troubles, but make sure they don't find out about me, just knowing one of us is an angel is bad enough, not two okay? Human's can't trust us if they know we've been faking it."

"Of course" I said. "They won't find out about you. I won't drag you down with me"

"What was that? The last part"

"Nothing"

"Good, now never mention it again" Her eyes crisscrossed the hall and came back to me, now with another smile that I hadn't seen before. "Good"

_Sorry, this one was actually really hard to write, believe it or not. I have to sort out whats happening next, but before I can do that I have to sort out whats happening in my head the ghost in the shell, a girl has consumed all of my thoughts so that these words almost mean nothing anymore._

### Chapter Thirty Four - Colita the Friend

So Max was supposed to arrive on Wednesday, but I still hadn't done anything of much importance. Then Jason came up to me with a 'request'

He dragged me out of the class, Mr. Gilbert didn't flinch an eye, he had long ago given up on disciplining anyone, he just wanted to get through school without his secret leaking. Instead of taking me down the hall Jason took me to his car.

"This is kidnapping" I said, "Do you want me to pleasure you?"

"You don't enjoy it anyway" he said. "No, that's not it, I want you to heal my girlfriend" He was dead serious, and I couldn't see any of the sarcasm that usually orbited around him.

"You want me to heal someone?" I poked my head in the window and saw a big sheet. Jason opened the door from the other end and took off the sheet. Underneath was a beautiful woman lying asleep.

"Who is that!" I recognized her, it was Colessa.

"It's my girlfriend" he said.

"But she's Colessa"

"Yeah, alright, Colessa our classmate is also my girlfriend, can you heal her?"

She sniffed and wiped her nose. She was wearing a long dress and had straps that ran up her shoulders.

"What's wrong with her?" I said. "Why is she sleeping in your car?"

"Because she's my girlfriend, we were going out in secret since about a week after she arrived."

"She never told me that" I said, "Jason, you're lying to me aren't you"

"No" he shook his head, "Ask her, she asked me to bring you"

Colessa turned over and squinted out of the dark car into the bright sunlight over us, then down to us, she covered her eyes with slender fingers and scruffed her hair back to see us more clearly.
"Did you get Colita?" she said.

"She's here" Jason leaned in and ran his fingers down her.

I was stunned, so what was happening here. First of all, no one knew that Jason had a girlfriend. And no one expected it to be Colessa, she had only been here for such a short time, why were the two of them already going out?

Then why did Jason ask me to pleasure him? Did Colessa know about that as well and approve of it, or was it all behind her back?

I looked at Jason and thought about me, why wasn't he attracted to me like he was to Colessa. What was it that she had that I didn't have? We were both angels and from the same culture, we both arrived at around the same time and were the new girls in school.

Even weirder was that I was talking to Colessa a few hours ago and she had been fine. Now she was lying in the car seat, like she was married to Jason or something.

"Can you heal me Colita" she groaned, "Please, you're the only one who can do it"

"What's wrong? Why can't you heal yourself?"

"I can't, I'm too tired" she said, "I'm soooo tired, I can hardly move" she rolled around on the back seat like a poi poi. 

"She said she got food poisoning" Jason said. 

"I think I have food poisoning from the food we went out to eat last night" Colessa said.

I looked at Jason, he was watching Colessa with caring eyes, he had one arm slouching over the car door and the other hand rubbing Colessa caringly. I knew that at that moment he would do anything to protect her.

I couldn't help feeling jealous, incredibly jealous, super duper jealous.

"Colessa I can't, I'm sorry but you know it's against the rules right? If you can't heal yourself then you're going to have to wait it out."

Colessa's eyes opened an inch, I saw her eyeballs, that was enough to make me shudder. They reflected so much sunlight that they looked like singularities stuck in her face. "But you've been healing Julia right?" Colessa said. "You healed her so many times when it was against the rules"

Colessa wasn't acting like herself, it was like she thought she was more special because she had Jason watching over her. He was like a lion statue guarding her entrance. When I talked to Colessa alone she was completely different.

"Why can't you?" Jason said.

"I sucked off Jason" I waited for a second but there was no response. Did they hear me? They acted like they hadn't. Coelssa was still groaning and Jason didn't move. I repeated it. "I sucked off..."

"I heard you the first time" Colessa said, "You don't have to repeat it to try and make me feel jealous"

Jason grinned, he was proud of it.

That wasn't the reaction I was expecting. I suddenly felt so ashamed at mentioning it, I was so low at trying to pull myself up by insulting them. When they didn't care it only showed me worse.

"We've got an open relationship" Jason said, "She doesn't mind what I do with other angels"

"You mean me? You're allowed to use me?"

"Let's not talk about this" Colessa said, "Can you just heal me now?"

"It's against the rules" 

"Stop arguing and come and heal me, I can't do our mission like this. Or do you want me to tell Max how you've been abusing your powers?"

"Okay, but I'm only doing this because I'm your friend" I said.

As I brought the necklace to my lips and leaned down to kiss her Colessa kept talking. "I went to a party back on one of my other missions, I talked to all of these guys about all sorts of things, I found them really cool to talk to. But then my boyfriend at the time got really really jealous so easily. He would always come over and stand between me and the other guys" She spoke likethere was nothing wrong with her

But she paused for a second when I breathed the life into her. "Sorry to make you do all of this" she said. "But I am giving you Jason to use, so don't worry too much okay?"

Even though that was reason to worry...

"I feel so much better" she stretched out her hands. I couldn't believe that she felt any different.

When Colessa said she felt better she stood up with a smile and clenched cheeks. "Thank you Colita"

"I don't know if that was the right choice or not" I said.

"It was the right choice" Colessa said.

"No one knows what the right or wrong choice is" I said.

"Well you weren't going to help because you were jealous, Ugh, get over it already." She waved her hand at me and climbed out of the car.

When she needed my help she didn't mind me breaking the rules, but as soon as she had to break them herself then she got all pedantic. What a hypocrite.

Jason took Colessa's hand and walked off with her back to class. I assumed they would let go of each other's hands before they reached within the vicinity of the classroom. I looked at my skin, it was turning green with envy.

But the green was also because of fear. I didn't know that they were such strangers to me. Jason and Colessa seemed perfectly content, and like they had always been that way.

Things really turned out weird. But after all this time I was the only one who had lost something. I lost Julia, but everyone else seemed to be functioning fine.

### Chapter Thirty Five

"Eh? Kawaisou da you" one girl said
"Maji kawaisou" the other girl said

I never knew there were Japanese human students in our school, but I wasn't surprised. Humans were really international. There were people of all countries in our class, but since now Julia wasn't with me I began to notice that all of these human students were different skin colors, some of them laughed and smiled more than others, some of them didn't laugh or smile at all. 

During morning tea Colessa and Jason didn't interact any differently. They completely fooled everyone. No one knew they were together. Not even a bit.

"Are you okay?" Nathan came over and sat down. "You look a bit clueless" He reached over and put a strand of my hair back in place (I love it when guys do that WOOT WOOT) It bounced out before landing in place.

"Don't touch me" I said. "You don't have the right to"

"Geez, chill okay?" Nathan sat back and stared at me. "You know I protected you back in the classroom when everyone was attacking you about being an angel. No one asked me to protect you, no one said you needed protecting, but I still went forth and did so, so maybe a little gratitude wouldn’t hurt."

"You didn't need to protect me" I said. "I could do that myself."

"Listen to yourself, the whole class was against you.” Nathan threw up his hands in frustration, “I just seem to get you to understand, any other girl that I saved like that in front of the class would be falling in love with me, but you seem like you hate me more because of it or something”

“I’m grateful” I flushed the hair he pulled out back into its place. Every strand on my head had its place, and I knew where each and every single one of them was supposed to go. “I’m just not nuts and going to die trying to thank you, thank you.”

Nathan didn’t drop it, he had to keep raising the same topic, “You're quite bitter to someone who could have saved your life. What would I do if you suddenly left? The classroom would feel empty"

"You didn't save my life" I moved my chair away from him. "You could have"

"You saved my life" he said.

"Yes I did, because if you were hurt...” Wait what? He had just reversed it.

"If you were hurt" he said, "I don't know what I'd do to make sure you were fine. I would become so sad, so that's why I'm saying that you saved my life." He changed tones, "Why do you always get pulled out of class by the guys?"

"Why do you ask?"

"I'm curious" he said. "Do Matt and Jason like you or something?"

"Maybe..." I nodded.

"Then do you like those guys, Matt and Jason?"

"No, no way, no no no, oh, no" I almost bit my straw in half.

He laughed, "That's a strong response, don't worry I wasn’t joking"

He said that, but he couldn't stop staring at me or smiling. Maybe I wasn't as alone as I thought. I pinched my hair, but leaving it so that it still looked good. Colita, stop thinking you're suffering when you have beautiful gorgeous boys taking care of your every whim. I smiled, it was kind of like being a princess in a castle full of handsome and caring men who all had great manners and chivalry. Whenever i sat down to eat, Nathan came to talk to me. If I thought about it, he was actually really sweet. Not many guys were like him.

What age was this...my dreaming was too much. I squealed in excitement.

"What is it? Let me in on it" Nathan said. "Tell me what makes Colita laugh"

"You're a great and good guy" I said, "Thank you for protecting me"

He looked confused, “Just now I yelled at you and barely got you to thank me, and now you’re thanking me without any ostensible reason”

“I had a think about it” I said.

“Well think about it more, please” Nathan pulled out a pencil and started to do the math work we were supposed to be doing right now.

"By the way, you're a bit different to other girls" Nathan said, "I thought you needed some protection"

"What do you mean I'm different?" I also brought out my math paper. I mean, Mr. Gilbert didn’t care if we did it or not, but in a strange way that’s what made us want to do it… It’s hard to explain.

Nathan’s voice was quiet, "I mean that, you seem to know a lot of things that we don't. I've been observing you and that's what I found.” He became even more quiet, probably because he was concerned for me, “You're a really nice girl, maybe people are demanding too much from you." 

"Nathan, how come you say that? I can’t believe you know me so well." It had been a while before anyone had said something that had clicked with me so strongly. 

"Of course I do" he said. "I know you the best of anybody here. You really love other people, that's why you suffer."

He had penetrated through everything about me so accurately that I was amazed. I hadn't even realized it myself, but when he said it like that it really made me happy. To have someone understood me so well was the biggest compliment I could expect. I watched Nathan as he did his math work, his chest still sweaty from lunchtime soccer. The hairs on his arm bowed down to his presence. This person here was the only one who saw me as a human and not as an angel. Actually, it seemed like he didn't even make a distinction between the two.

Nathan and I both sat there for a while. It was a beautiful feeling, I didn’t know what it was. One of our classmates went out the door beside us. The wind had picked up since we were gone. Inside the cafeteria was sheltered and calm and warm. But she walked out the door, next moment we saw her walking outside in the strong wind, holding her hat, her jacket was blowing heavily like a flag standing in the center of the world. But there was no sound, we could only see it happening. It must have been cold out there. The girl slowly diminished and became smaller, until she got to the opposite building and opened the door and entered, and exited from our view.

A while later she came back through the cold slowly growing closer, she stood next to the window and fumbled for a second, then the door opened and she walked in. Her cheeks were smudged red, and her hat was out of place. She closed the door behind her and did everything back up. Suddenly there was sound and color again. We heard her zip down her jacket and remove her cute beanie.

She saw us watching and smiled and moved on. She smiled at both of us for the same length, then moved on. She was a nice person.

Now I knew what the feeling was. Maybe, just maybe it was the rare feeling you found when you realized that you were one with the world, one big chunk meant to be together. When you had the passion to help others around you and find the good qualities in them.

The process of thinking of only one thing with so much passion that it consumes you. What poets and writers and musicians and people talked of.

Maybe, this was that rare sympathy of love.

"Colita" Nathan said. "There's something I should tell you"

“Don’t speak” I held up my hand. “Can you not speak right now, just give me five minutes okay?” Any speaking, talking, listening, thinking right now would just ruin this mood. It was something I think only humans felt. I wanted to cherish it for as long as possible, as long as it lasted.

“Can I speak now?” Nathan said.

“Okay” I exhaled everything left in me out into the open air.


"It's nothing big, but I wanted you to hear it from me before the rumors started spreading." He sighed and breathed out as well, as if he wanted to join the party. 

Was he trying to confess to me? What else could the important thing he say be?

"Colessa tried to get with me"

I stared at him blankly, that was the last thing I was expecting him to say. 

“Colita, are you okay?”

“I’m fine, I just wasn’t….expecting that”

He told me the whole story, I just watched as his lips moved and sounds came flowing into me, jumbling whatever was left of me into a big mashed up smoothie.


He said that Colessa tried to get with him, she tried and they went out. But still she just wasn't as interesting as he hoped, he still liked me more. Colessa must have felt really sad about it, because she saw me and copied, with boyfriends. But even after copying and trying her best, she still didn't match up to me.

I started to cry, then Nathan put his arms around me, in the middle of class. The others who were doing their math dropped their pencils, moved their chairs around, and became our audience. They stopped talking and just watched us as we hugged and joined.

Nathan whispered, “It was supposed to be a compliment, because you’re so amazing, I’m so glad that I can finally talk like this now with you, I always wanted to be closer to you, but you were with my friends.”

He was speaking so softly, I didn’t know guys were this sensitive, he was really thinking for me, taking care of me. But his medicine didn’t help.

"Don't be afraid" he said, "Even if you're afraid of the worst happening to you, don't think like that, it's not healthy. You need to believe in yourself more, stop lowering yourself beneath others. Just because others around you shine so brightly, you can't even see yourself any more. But you need to shine as well, so that people will notice you. You deserve to be here on this earth just as much as anyone else."

"What are you saying?" I tilted my head. Nathan shrugged, "I'm just saying, this is the way things are."

He completely didn't understand me, that wasn't what I was worried about at all. They could try all he wanted, but a guy didn't know a girl's heart. A girl's heart was like a needle in an ocean. All it was, was that I really liked him, it was really that simple, he didn't need to over-think, what he was saying shouldn't concern me.

But it did, and it made me feel worse. That what I was really afraid of, not fitting in. I was afraid of being inherently different, and it hurt to know that it was visible to him. I thought that if I kept it hidden from everyone and no one ever noticed it, then it wouldn’t exist. But Nathan had been thinking about it, that was why he said it to me. My deepest fears were not concealed.

I really didn’t understand; why did everything have to be about people betraying or cheating on each other? Trying to take something from someone, trying to get any benefit they could. Why couldn’t we have lives where none of this happened, where we didn’t have to find grief around every corner? Why couldn’t all of us spend more time in pure and uplifting conversations with friends? I wanted to talk to Nathan and any of my classmates, everyone else.

I tried not to let it bother me, I wanted to stop caring about these things but they kept coming back.

I looked up into the sky, the sun was setting early in the winter. The trees were black silhouettes against the bright orange sky. Some adults were jogging past outside, clueless about anyone else. The orange sunlight slowly scrolled down and lower and down, bringing down all of the colors up in the sky down and hiding it into the earth. A deeper red came down and when that disappeared, the trees stopped waving in the horizon and everything became dark.

Then I realized I had become vain.

trees look like things waving against the horizon, early morning jogging. Orange sunlight slowly scrolling up to reveal more colors beneath it. A deeper red comes up, then slowly scrolls up like credits to a movie and becomes orange. Until suddenly everything around me was visible. The school I always knew looked normal and completely normal.
She sees it and realizes that she has become vain.

### Chapter Thirty Six

When school finished I decided to take a different route home. One that I had travelled less often by. That was when I ran into Jason's sister. 

I didn't recognize her until she waved me over from across the street. I crossed the street towards her as she waited at the curb, tapping her heel against the concrete like a golden metronome to the beat of absolute time.

“Hi Colita” she said. “I remember you” She pointed her finger at me and slyly retraced it back beside her.

“Hi Jason's sister”

She was wearing expensive clothes, but it wasn't just her shell that was exquisite, she gave off the aura of a fine well cultured and educated woman. People like her were usually loud in school.

“You noticed me” I said.

“Why wouldn't I?” she said, “You were the prettiest little thing to ever visit our place last time”

By last time she meant weeks ago, when I first came here. And by pretty, she probably meant that I was threatening.

“You're so pretty” she smiled and shook her head. “You're usually the quiet type aren't you, sticking to yourself and doing your own thing, but when you're as pretty as you are, the life chooses you, and you drift into the center of attention.” She brought out a mirror and checked herself. I swear that she had an accessory in every pocket. Although she hardly had pockets because she was so slim, any space for pockets was left for slimness. “It's not your fault”

Everyone knew about Jason's sister. She pleasured herself all the time, she gave it to herself. The rumor came straight from the mouth of Jason. 

But on meeting her I couldn't imagine it. She was too impressive to be doing that, to be giving it to herself all the time.

"You know don't you?" she sighed.

"About what?" I said.

"I bet he's told everyone about me, he just had to."

I blushed, "You mean...about you and your...ways?"

She frowned, "You think I'm a bad woman? An unworthy daughter? We all have desires, everyone you meet at school and everyone on the street has them, it's just that most people walk past pretending not to notice. I pretend not to notice my brother's desire and so he should pretend not to notice my dirty deeds. But he goes and spreads them around like peanut butter" Although she spoke quickly, I didn't feel like her tone was demeaning, it was more of a general melancholy that had permeated into the cracks and forks of her being.

She cocked her head towards me, "Are you also judging me? Do you think I'm a perverted lady too? I'm not that much older than you, you know."

"No" I shook my head, my age wasn't dissimilar to hers. "You're just a woman fallen in passion" She had the same troubles I did, and her anxiety was not foreign to me. We all had to swim somewhere, it's what kept us alive. It's just that she wasn't as good at hiding hers as I was. 

“I don't know about you” she looked me up and down, “You might be good at hiding it, but most people I meet really don't have any idea when it comes to love. They think that everything revolves around them. My brother is the same.” She brought out her mirror again. This time I noticed that this was a gesture of insecurity, not something she was trying to accomplish, some sign that she had something to hide.

It meant that she was kind.

“I can't see what kind of desires you have” She looked me up and down like a scanner searching for paper. “But if you are perverted, then you will still judge me, maybe even more so”

“People will always judge, especially those who are most similar to them?” I said.

“No, people are all hypocrites” she shut her mirror in her pocket and swept around.


“You shouldn't do that kind of thing though” I said, “You have a younger brother”

“You're right” she looked at me. Then she looked at me, “You're right”

I realized I was telling her not to do exactly what I had been doing myself. 

“Do you always take this path?” she said. “How come I haven't seen you here before” She was really pretty, and walking confidently, but as soon as she talked I could tell that there was something else going on.

“I don't usually” I said, “And I probably won't anymore”

“Okay” she said. 

As I walked back home I started thinking about how things in my life were all the same, but as soon as I took this path everything was different again.

“Colita” she called out. I stopped and turned around. “Yes?”

“Can I tell you something?” she said, “In private?”

I just had water at the cafe and did other things. She had some tea that she ordered with a smile.

“Do you know my name?” she said.

“No” I shook my head. I really didn't know it at all.
“I have a name, my name is an important one to me” she said, “And I sing it out loud wherever I go.” She wrapped her fingers around the cup, trying to sap as much heat from its interior as was possible.When the cup broke, she ordered a new tea with the same smile.

“I really have a name. My name is Joyce” she said. “See? I have a name”

Her tea was gone, and so was her smile.

“Joyce, what is it you wanted to tell me?” I finished my water in one go, strands of it soaked onto my hair like paint flairing through the air.

She shook her head. “Jason's friend, Matt, has he been playing up at school?”

“Yes” I said, “He's a big problem”

“You know, we all have ups and downs in our mood right?” She nodded before I answered, “I know we all do”

“Yes” I didn't know where she was taking this.

“Matt has extremes, for him this life is just like playing a real time game, one of those real time high tension ones wheree can't see the world properly and forgets about it for long periods of time.” Out of nowhere she started to sob, it looked like the same paint that had stuck to the edges. “Colita, he's sick, Matt's sick. He's always been able to deal with it, but now he's really messed up. He's always talking to himself and always doing things that we can't approve of.”

“But you're Jason's sister right? Joyce, what's it got to do with you” I knew she was sad, but he wasn't her family.

“Who's Joyce?” She wiped her eyes, “Right, it's me. My family and Matt's family have always been close, but recently it's just been too hard for us. We take care of Matt a lot, because he's got problems, but his problems have exasperated into almost untameable levels. What can I do for him, I know he's suffering as well, and I really want to help but I can't.”

I felt ashamed, I was only thinking about myself, about what issues I had, about the things I wanted to solve. Here was Joyce, (or whatever her real name was) caring about someone else so much that she had it preserved in her. She was able to cry for someone else.

My head ducked, I realized I was staring at my feet, all I thought about was whether I was popular enough, whether someone else was better or worse than me . I was always afraid that someone was prettier than me, or not being able to be a human. In Joyce's presence I felt so small, my ignorance was inflated like a balloon. I was too selfish to want to help anyone.

The regret started to welt up in me like candle wax, hardening my whole being into an implacable statue. No one would ever cry for me after I left, it made me afraid of leaving.

“Sorry, I just had to tell someone, I don't want to burden all of my close friends with this, I've already told them so much, and I can't tell Matt, so...you're all that's left for me. Sorry”

“I will try to protect him” I said. “I'm in his class, I think I can do something”

“Matt's very important to us, he can't be taken from us” Joyce said, she stared at me blankly, “His suffering is what makes him unique, it's what makes him special, do you think you can handle that? If you want to change him, you have to embrace his specialness and change him without compromising him.”

“We're all special” I said.

She took out her wallet, “He is more special, he is the kind of person who comes along once in a lifetime, we're lucky to have him around us. He is one of the most special kind of person the world has ever seen”


“What is a special person?” I said, “How is he different to anyone else?” He was violent and rude, there was nothing noble or special about that.

Joyce looked around, she took out a note of money then changed her mind and slipped it back in her wallet. “Do you want to hear it?” she said. “You'll probably think I'm weird if I tell you this.”

“I've heard a lot of weird things before” The world these days was brimming with weird things. I had to use binoculars just to find the normal way.

“You know how I live as a person?” she said, “I eat sleep and go to the toilet”

“Is that what makes you a normal person?” I said. 

“No, of course that's not all, people are complicated beings made up of a variety of biosocial, physiological, emotional, psychological colors blended into a collage that you happen to see in front of you. The collage is always changing”

“Then what makes a human?” I said.

“Wow, you just completely changed my topic” she said, “That's kind of annoying. Being a human, I think, means that you are influenced by someone. Influenced by trees, by animals, by dogs, by pictures, or by people. It's to have that consciousness and interconnectedness, I think. That's just what I think okay, if you ask someone else they will tell you differently”

I wasn't expecting such a scientific answer, it was disappointing. “I sometimes feel like I'm not a human, or not worthy of being one” I said.

She raised her hand, “Okay stop, let me finish my train fo thoguht first okay? You asked me about Matt, and it's a touchy topic but I decided to tell you, I don't know why I would tell you, but I need to tell someone, so interrupting, can you not?”

“Sure” I bowed down.

“Matt's really special because of what's down here” She pointed between her legs.

“He has a vagina?”

Joyce's mouth dropped. “Don't say that kind of stuff, that's disgusting”

I laughed, “What do you mean, you're the one who pointed down there”

“Noooo! I meant to say that his sperm is really volatile”

“What?”

“When Matt was a little boy, he went to the doctor's and they found that he had a volatile sperm that would make a baby into a monster”

It related to what Max told us about Matt. That his offspring would be angels. He was the bridge linking our two races. But Joyce was wrong, we weren't monsters. Maybe we weren't human, but we definitely weren't monsters either.

Joyce brought out her wallet, it was a long one with zips waiting around the side. “Because of this small difference Matt is left out alone in the world. Maybe because of this one thing he feels like he is unable to influence others. Maybe because of it he is unable to be influenced by others, so he has to resort to violence”

“But he looks fine” I said.

“He can look and act as a human and do things, but inside, he has this sperm which means that his children will be monsters.”

I didn't want to argue back with her. I never thought about Matt and what he was facing, even when I was upset at him I never bothered to think about why. 

“Hmm, okay, so you think you understand?” she said, “You became silent. Either you think you understand him or are really disgusted by him, and by me for telling you this.”

“No, you're wrong” I brought out my wallet to bring out some cash to the table as well. “

“Well earlier you said you felt like you don't belong as well right? How come?”

“Just one small thing, basically an insignificant tiny difference makes me feel so different to everyone else”

“What do you think Matt feels, he has a tiny difference, but it is changing his whole life. It's not his fault, it's not anyone's fault. Even when he looks for someone to blame, he can't. That's probably the most frustrating part about it.” Joyce stood up and pushed her change to the middle of the table, under the salt and pepper.

"Compared to some others you are living as a human, you do everything a human does, you're influenced by the same hurt and the same pain that all humans feel, so what more do you want? Do you still feel different? Do you still feel special?"

Joyce waved me goodbye, “Goodbye Colita” It was sudden but not uncalled for.
I realized that I always had been a human all this time. This is what humans are, this low down group of emotions and beliefs with problems orbiting around them. IN our minds we were all in the center. 

That night Max called for an update and I asked him if he would cry if something happened to me. Was there enough influence from me?


His answer was beautiful, “That's why I always tell you to go around protected, and that's why I call you so often.” 

“Are you being honest?” I said, “Or are you just saying that because you know I'm upset?” I felt sorry to always bother him like this with my crying sprees in the middle of the night, but he was the only one I could talk about this with.

“To be honest, I like you” he said. “I know I need to support you, and I feel grateful for everyday that I am able to help you, I feel most useful when you come to me for help.”


Then what he said next me broke me down.

“Colita, to be more honest, I really really like you. I but I can't admit that without making myself very vulnerable.” 

After I calmed down he started feeding me the information. I told him about Max, and how he was suffering and I wanted to find a way to help him. We were angels, but I felt like we weren't able to do anything for him.

“Colita, you've finally realized, we have to help these people, that's why this mission is so important and we have to help Matt. That's why you were sent. It's not a coincidence okay?”

I teared up but tried to hide it from Max. Just the fact that he seemed to know everything, whenever I was worried or upset about anythign he led the way for me. I could rely on him every time.

“Okay?” he said.

“Okay” 

After the call finished, I lay on the couch, but I didn't smoke. I wanted to be strong, I wanted to think positively how I could help things. And finally I thought of Julia, and if she was watching me, if she was watching all of us. What could I do to help her.

### Chapter Thirty Seven - Colita the Fraud
	
I woke up fifteen minutes earlier than usual for the morning, fifteen minutes to conquer the chaos. With the spare time I wanted sure to meditate and think about my life. But when I sat down it was kind of weird, I didn't know how to meditate. I tried crossing my legs and sitting still for a while but it just felt awkward. I felt the fly creeping up on me, and the sun a long venomous snake invading from the window. People always came up and told me all sorts of things about all sorts of things. One topic that repeatedly came up in these short and constructive conversation sessions was meditation. I felt like I should start it one day. And there was no better time than now. 

I tried to sit, but the ground didn't feel flat, even after I brought a mat over for balance it still felt wrong.

Then I realized that my bum cheeks weren't placed evenly across the floor. No matter how I moved or twisted or grinded, the right side felt like it was higher. I came to the horror of realizing just how I had been walking around my whole life with my right bum cheek sticking out to the world, and I hadn't noticed it until now.

In any case, the morning became a self criticizng session, with me as the host, co host, and prime guest. You could take me away, just let me pull the last of these strands of hair out first.

When I finally set out, for the first time I saw so many people around me. The world was full of people struggling to live their lives, overflowing with those carving out their paths. And those who were still finding the tools to. 


There wasn't a cloud in the sky. It really was quiet today, oh.

I walked forward thinking about the environment, it was like my third eye had awakened, and everything I saw was imprinted in me like a hot scathing stamp ready to swear. Everything an angel did happened in out own environment, so it was no surprise that we grew up differently. Everything a human did happened in his own environment, so it was no surprise that they grew up differently. It was where a lot of interactions took place. But it was physically impossible for everyone to be in the same place. Imagine what if all of the humans grew up where the angels did as well, then wouldn't we all get along much better?

As I walked to school a strange object showed up, it was lying on the footpath abruptly with it's end struggled in the footpath. I peered up and saw the empty sky, ahead there was another one, just around the slight curve of the path where it joined into a bigger one, where construction had taken place a few weeks ago. It was flat on the path, as if someone had placed it there deliberately.


It was knives, not knives for cutting, not knives for cooking, but just knives. I had seen a few recently, they were lying around like forgotten belongings. Things that had once been important to someone before they were forgotten.

I knew what they were, they were carving knives. Everyone used them to carve out their life and the direction they wanted to take in their life. I didn't know why these knives were lying around here in staccato, but it was a different perspective.

I didn't find any more knives up to the school gate. Inside the school nothing was different, it was the same things happening on a different day. Again and again.

Except, a wild BOY jumped into view. The BOY had scruffy hair and a tough uniform with slight bits of mud on it. His shoes sparkled in delight and his fingers moved individually like the waves.

The boy spoke, he had four functions. Fight, Run, Get Assistance, and Help.


He chose Fight, and asked me to be his girlfriend. It would elevate his title to that of Boyfriend, as opposed to BOY, and it would mean that he was mutually exclusive with his Girlfriend, which happened to be me.

“Nathan” I said, “What are you doing, you're acting so weird”

“Am I?” he said, then he gazed at me and looked at me from three different angles, “Now am I?”

My gosh, he was being so immature, it was like talking to a primary school kid.


“So is it a yes or no?” he said, “Do you want to be my girlfriend?”

“Well, what will the others think?” I wondered why he was asking me, I was just the plainest girl on the plains. I don't know what he saw in me. “What do you like about me?”

“I like you as a friend” Nathan said “Because you're so calm” He brushed my hair. Gosh my school bag was still on, I hadn't even gotten to homeroom yet and I was already golashing with boys. “But I like you as a girl” he said, “Because you're not threatening, so I am allowed to feel strong in front of you, and I keep bouncing off things from you and they come back to me as confidence.”


“Nathan, I don't know if that's a compliment...”

“It's hard to explain, Just take it as one okay?”


“Okay...” he had just done it again. Seriously high school guys couldn't please a woman's heart. His words just didn't reach into the steep crevasses that had weathered me.

But his effort was cute. In the end the only thing that could heal a heart this broken was love. That was all I knew.


“So is that a yes?” he said.

“It's a no way” I crossed my hands, “I didn't even consider it”

Nathan wasn't dejected, in fact it looked like he even expected me to reject and was prepared for retaliation. “Since I've gotten to know you” he said, “I feel like you bring out the best in me, you make me want to do so much good, not just for you, but for the world”

“Yes Nathan” I said, “It's called love, welcome to my world” I smiled, “You're so easy to read” He was so easy to read.

“Yeah, I just realized that you knew...” He said.

Now it was confusing, what did he mean? Did he mean that my love was confusing? Or did he mean that he had found something else?

“Now I realize” Nathan said, “Jason was right about you”

“What do you mean? Nathan, what do you mean?”

“You're not a human” he said, “You're an angel aren't you? You were lying to everyone.”

“No...” Argh, so much for my good start this morning, now it all felt useless. Why did I go to all that effort to try and be good when this kind of thing kept coming to me.

“You lied” he said. “You're a liar”

“I didn't lie about anything” I said, “Humans and angels aren't different at all, we shouldn't be separating the two. In the past we segregated based on the color of our skin, or on our race, or on our religion, or on our age, or on our gender, or on any identifying feature that we have, but we've come to reject these notions one by one. Rejecting a dichotomy of race and skin is just one step further from our primacy and one step towards an equal civilization to unite all of the races.”
(Think further, and make it more concise)

“No” he said, “You were lying to me, I realized it the moment you rejected me, no girl ever rejects me, I'm the third most handsome guy in this school”

“Is that all?” If that was all, then he was incredibly conceited.

“It's because it seems like you understand love” he said, “Like you've loved before”

“I haven't loved before” I said, “I don't understand love at all” I withheld my meditative session from him.

“Well you're closer to it than any of us are” He was almost in tears, I couldn't believe it, the macho always trash talking Nathan with unbounding confidence and willpower was starting to let loose the first signs that he had a stash of liquid inside him. And what was he going to cry over? My lying about being an angel? 

“I feel betrayed” His feelings were real, “I protected you last time in class when Matt tried to hurt you, I protected you even though the whole class was opposed to it.”

“And I thanked you for it” I said, “I'm very grateful for you doing that” I was starting to think that I should have accepted his advances. I should have agreed to get with him.


“I defended you because I thought you were innocent” he said, “I thought you were good”

“Nathan” I pointed at me, trying to get his hand and rub it over my cheeks and lips, “Look at me, feel me, I'm human, I look and feel like a human, I go to the toilet, I take dumps too. I'm not any different to you, I'm innocent and I'm good”

He withdrew his hand from me and tucked it on himself. “You can't be, that's why Matt hates you so much.”

Everyone found out things in different ways, whether it was true or not everyone noticed something different from the same situation. 

And whether I wanted it or not, Nathan thought I wasn't a normal girl, he thought I was a strange heartless monster out to eat the world.

It was with that that I decided to run. I couldn't face this anymore, wherever I turned people were accusing me of something, someone was angry at me. Someone always had something judge.

“I'm going to go” I retreated from him, “You're not going to listen to anything that I have to say. You don't care about me at all.”

I didn't want to see his expression, because he didn't answer.

### Chapter Thirty Eight - Colita the Popular Kid

I still didn't know how everyone had found out I was an angel. It was like everyone who was so obsessed with living their own lives and progressing themselves in this world had all suddenly agreed to take a break and hate on an angel. They were unified in their animosity, no amount of intentions or goodwill would be able to sever the bonds constructed between us.

I sat at the staircase, on the bottom level, next to the nerds. They felt awkward that I was sitting there with them, when I arrived they were playing card games and were laughing loud. Now they were sitting solemnly and whispering to one another, the cards were nowhere to be seen, stowed away in someone's bag. I didn't want to interrupt them, but I also wanted privacy.

They probably didn't know anything about me being an angel. The divide of school hierarchies stood greater than the bridge that gossip set. To them I was just a popular girl who was weirdly looking for peaceful time alone here.

I smiled at them, to try and break the ice, they all stared back at me like a statue had just moved. 

I wonder if these kids could speak. That had mouths and tongues, but were they able to use them effectively to portray what they were thinking? Were they able to communicate with the world and reciprocate consistent conversation?

Haha, I guess not.


“She's the pretty looking girl” One of the students said, “The one who's always at the top with the beast”

The others all nodded in contemplation. If I moved, their eyes followed my movement, if I stopped moving they tensed up in anxiety of my next move.

I didn't know who was the monkey in the cage here, me or them?

“Can we talk?” I said. 

They looked at me in confusion. How come this monkey was talking? What kind of species was she? This was a spectacular monkey.

“Do you know who I am? Do you speak english?” 

They looked at each other and began to whisper. I didn't know if it was because they didn't speak english.

I gave up, “I'm just going to talk, so I need you to listen to me” I coudln't believe that there was this much difference between the top and the bottom, the bottom was blind, the top was blind. Or else it was a language barrier that destroyed all efforts at mutuality.

I wanted an audience, someone I could talk to without being judged.

“Why does Matt hate me?” I said, “He's not jealous right? I didnt give him anything to be jealous about. I mean, he's not an honest man, most guys I meet, we kiss, then I give him head, then he puts the tip in me, then he confesses. They are honest men who fulfill a logical and meaningful set of actions. But Matt, he doesn't take me seriously, he laughs at me. He really confuses me”


They were still staring at me. I went forward and grabbed one of them and sat him down in front of me. “Do you think I'm pretty?” I said. Men were all walking through art galleries checking out every painting before buying one. But if they didn't have to buy and could just rent, then they would be happy.

He looked confused. “Yes” he said.

I laughed, he couldn't lie, he couldn't deny it when I questioned him. He was so honest. It was refreshing to hear that answer after all the lies that had been circulating around me. Lying was something that was learned by a select few.

“It's okay, you can go now” I said. The kid got his back together and stood up and went back to his friends, they all scurried out like cockroaches who had seen a bright light.

I guess that was me...:)

Colessa announced in class that Jason had a gun. Colessa wasn't the one who announced it, but I remembered it most when she said it. 

“Jason has been bringing a gun to school, one of the girls saw him and told the teacher”

“What did the teacher say?” I said

“The teacher took him to the Principal”

“What did the Principal say?” I said.

“The Principal called Jason's sister”

“Joyce? What did Joyce say”

“It kind of fuzzled out after that”

I sighed, that wasn't something that Colessa was supposed to be saying.

“Colita, I've been watching over Matt this whole week, you haven't been doing anything, so do you think you can take over for me?”

“I think I can”

“Good” she said, “From next class it's your turn”

“No, it's your turn”

“Huh?”

“Yeap, I can do it, no worries”


Colessa looked at me and finally gave me decent conversation. “Jason cares about angels, a lot more than you think.”

“He hates me” I said, “I've never been hated so much, I want to hurry up and finish this job.”

“Jason actually really likes angels, it's just Matt who hates them.” Colessa spoke like she wasn't an angel, like she was outside and looking in.

“It's because Jason is proud, he says women have just as much pride as men do, sometimes even more. But angels have no pride, that's why he loves angels.”

“Okay...” That probably wasn't true, but I guess he could believe whatever he wanted.

“Matt hates angels for the same reason, I think” Colessa said, “That's what Jason is guessing, that Matt hates angels for the same reason. But he isn't sure, Matt doesn't talk much, even to him”

“Matt's just a prejudiced blind pig” I said.

“He might just be having trouble at home” Colessa said, “It's our job to take care of him, don't forget that, you're living your own life too much and forgetting what to do.”

“It's easy for you to say, they know I'm an angel, but not about you”

Colessa ignored this fact conveniently “It doesn't matter what Matt's motivations are, what he does and what he doesn't do, just make sure you do the job, which is to watch over him”


Matt's real name was the beast when he was born, but some other caretakers gave him the name Matt. Actually his real name is the beast. I don't know where I got that information from, but I suddenly remembered it.

“So what is this about Jason's gun?” I said. “Why does he feel the need to bring such a violent device to a school?”

“I don't know” Colessa said, “But it doesn't matter, we just need to do our job”

Uhh, it did matter. It definitely did matter. This was a gun we were talking about, not a plastic toy, not a home device. This was a gun, this was something used to kill.

### Chapter Thirty Nine - Matt the War Machine

The next time I saw Jason I could only think “gun, gun, gun” he had a gun in his pocket. If I upset him I might upset him.


Such a cold device was sitting in his hands in the middle of our school.... Ever since people had found out, our school became a gun centered territory.

The beast was waiting for me with a grin. “I heard the news” he said. His voice was hoarse, like he hadn't spoken in a long time and these were the first words coming forth from his mouth.

“What are you talking about?” I said.

“Jason told me that you're an angel”

“I'm not” I shrugged, “But you guys can spread whatever rumors you want”

“Nathan told me the same”

What was with these guys and gossip, couldn't they keep to themselves? The way they frolicked was like girls or something. Like the clouds in the sky moisturising each other as they passed. When too much of them met they became an unpleasant downpour.

“You've got a good imagination” I tried to laugh but all that came out was a tear.


“Everyone tells me you're an angel” Matt said. 

What did everyone else know, they were just following the others.

“You're not true” I said.


“Lacey is really embarrassed to be around you” he said.

“So whatever?”

“What I want to know is, why are you doing all of this” he said. “What brings you here, who are you looking over, and for what reason”

Now I didn't know if he was lying and he actually knew, or he didn't know and was lying to pretend like he actually knew, or he actually didn't know and was asking and pretending that he knew but actually didn't.

“Anyway” he said, “I think you missed me”

“No” I shook my head, “No way”

“Come on” He stood up and pointed to his crotch, “You missed my taste right?”

“No, you're disgusting.” 

Next moment I was crouched in front of him. I coudln't believe myself, I had no self control, I didn't mind doing this.


As I did Matt. He started laughing, “Why?” I said.

He laughed harder. “Because you sleep with me, then kiss Colessa, and then suck the teacher off, then do favours for Jason, then kiss Lacey, you're so messed up Colita”

I didn't know how to reply, it was beyond him knowing everything I had done, it was him talking about me, as if I was a rag that had been shared by everyone.

“I'm surprised that angels don't feel any pride to stand up for themselves.” he said.

Maybe he really did dislike our lack of pride.

I was ashamed, I wasn't a good role model to represent the rest of her race, what I was doing really brought everyone down. "Not all angels are like me you know, I'm not a good angel, others would never allow you to do this to me, to them."

"You're a great angel" he said.

“I'm not” I said.

He laughed. “You're not an angel, but you really heal my bad moods”

“Do I?” I said, “Isn't it just you? From what I imagine, angels are good at healing”


“What?” He twitched in my mouth, like a dog's ear when it just heard about a bone. “I imagine they would be really kind”

“How would you like your angel, with some chilli, or some pepper, or some salt?”

“Salty is good, be salty” 

“But I'm not an angel” I said.

“Yeah, you're not” he said.

"I'm not an angel, but how did you find out?" My hair always came loose in front of me and I had to move it back. I took his hand and put it on my hair to try and make him hold it in place.

“Jason heard it from someone who was following you around, I mean I don't believe him, but that's why he said.”


His horn was like the tip of a gun, cold and solid, it would eventually fire it's deadly shots to rest inside me until my blood ran cold.

Snot ran down my nose as I started breathing more heavily, it was hard work. “Do you hate angels?” I said. 

“Why do you care, you're not an angel right?” he said.

“I'm not, but I wonder for all of them”

The machine gun fired, it drowned out all noise and black beads buried themselves in my mouth and hair.

“You look disgusting” Matt said. He sheathed the machine gun into his open pants while it was still smoking, “You look disgusting” he said.
“Thank you” I said. “It means I'm not an angel”


Everyone already knew, it was too late now. But if Matt denied it here, then he could sway things and save me. Everyone stared at me now, but if Matt changed his mind, he could turn everything back to the way it was. Every sheep had its turn as the head of the herd, but this sheep didn't have anything.

It was kind of nice this time, but next time I saw Matt, an hour later, his mood had worsened and there was a cloud over him.

“You're such a dishonest and filthy girl.” he grinned, he was so handsome. “Keep going, I never said you could stop.” 

"You're not a girl anyway, you're just an angel, f**** useless junk." He looked down every now and then, but no matter what I did, he wasn't satisfied.

I kept pressing, because if I didn't then he would never see me. I had no freedom, I was in a sunflower field with all the sunflowers facing away. I followed and also faced their way. 

Then I cried and cried, tears were running down with my saliva and his insides into a puddle on the floor. Matt didn't care. I hadn't looked up at his face in a while. 

Then I cried because as an angel I might have no God. maybe there is no God that cares for me because I wasn't human. Because no human would be treated this way by others. No human would let themselves become so low and agree to do such base things. Because a human would stand up for them self. Because I was so low and not worth anyone's love.

“Listen carefully, you're representing all the whores of your race. You're a subhuman animal only good for a few things. Do you understand?”

I nodded, “Yes” He was becoming warmed and warmed against my lips. His veins surged with fatigue.

Maybe Colessa was wrong, maybe Matt's hatred of angels stemmed from us needing him. Maybe he didn't want the responsibility.

“We're not so different” Matt said, “I'm a horrible person as well. Angels have always bothered me”
  
That was not nearly enough reason for his actions.

“I am a prejudiced person against angels, I am aware of it. Prejudice is everywhere in the world. I think it's going to be windy outside today.”

Before Matt was finished, he took ages to release, it was like the pent up energy inside him just kept flowing and flowing, Nathan walked past. I knew it was him because he called out.

“Colita, what are you doing?” That's right, he still liked me, even this useless base and useless me. He stood behind me, I didn't see his expression, I didn't see Matt's expression, I was too busy focused on what was in front of me. We were at different points in life.
Nathan tugged on my shoulders, he tried to separate us. Matt didn't do anything so I slapped Nathan and went back to pleasuring Matt. It was one of the few things that gave me pleasure anymore.

“What are you doing?” Nathan said. “What are you doing? Do you realize what you're doing? I knew you did this stuff, everyone talked about it, but seriously what's wrong with you, do you have no integrity.” He held his cheek as it swelled red from my slap. 

“I thought we got along” Nathan said. “Stop doing that to him”

He said a few more things before leaving.

“Colessa told all of us” Matt said after the air was cleared.

“Hmm, okay” I said.

“Colessa's the other angel isn't she? I'll deal with her as well.”

“You do that” I moved up and down him like a bottle cap trying to close the gap.


“I'm not psychologically damaged, I'm just a human. A true expressive human who isn't afraid of being judged. We're a scary species when we're not afraid.” He chuckled as he released. It was like toxins accumulating in my mouth and burning through my tongue. “An angel will never know a human and will find excuses for human behavior. Stop trying to analyze me, it's none of your business.”

I nodded, but stayed still for a while longer to let the last of him be packaged. 

“I'm just a machine” he said, “You can analyze me all you want”

### Chapter Forty

That's right, we've gotten forty chapters into this story and have hit about 107,000 words. So...thanks a lot if you've made it this far. Tell me what you think, if the story is slowing down and staleing, or if it's getting more interesting. Let's see what comes next. It's not going to be too much longer I promise.


Today was Wednesday, Max arrived today. 

But before anything happened, there was an incident downstairs in the school. It wasn't Matt, it wasn't Jason, it was someone more special.

Lacey had her hands on her hips, her hair was calm, her cheeks were a furnace, “Thanks for acting like you cared thanks for making me feel like I was the only one. And thank you very much for watching as I crawled.”

I stood there stunned, partly because she was looking at me as she said it. But her words were out in the open and had already been released, they couldn't be stored back in her anymore.


The guy who was responsible came forward, his uniform pants were tight on his groin. “Lacey, I love you” Matt said. “Don't you understand you are the only one to me, and I was trying to help you.”

“You keep cheating on me” I was surprised Lacey was announcing this to the school. Usually she wouldn't show any weakness in front of anyone, she would do anything to stay popular and look good.

But it seemed that even Lacey had had enough. “I'm breaking up with you” she said, “I know you don't care, I know you don't think about me at all anyway, so I may as well just do it here”

Lacey was a flower once strong, but now withered from the attendance of too much sun.

Matt ignored her, as he ignored everyone else. He didn't care about anything anyone said.

Lacey burst into tears and collapsed onto the ground, all the courage having drained from her into those around her. There were few things more satisfying for a high school girl to see than the queen collapsing from her pedestal.

Matt headed straight to the roof. I could hear the vague outline of a helicopter making its way over. I saw Colessa on the other end and ran forward. I had to take over, it was my turn to watch over Matt now. Colessa nodded when she saw me lurch forward.

Matt was already on the roof by the time I got there. The helicopter was a speck that grew and grew. I held my hair and bag as it came tumbling away. Matt stood in front of me with his forehand covering his head. He stared at the helicopter solemnly, as if it was his ride out.

The wind increased as it landed and the rotors slowed to a blur, then to a standstill.

The door slid open and black shoes jumped out, connected to an outrageous body. Max smiled back at me and I felt the familiarity of him rejuvenating my muscles.

Matt turned his head several times, he looked at me, then at Max, then at me. Then he reached to his pocket.

“Nooooo! Max, watch out, he has a gun!” I ran forward but Max was too late, he stumbled and fell. A gaping hole was in his chest, he staggered back a couple of steps and fell off the side of the roof.


Matt had his hand held out, at the end of it was a filthy black gun, reflecting the sun's rays in full force and screaming violence.

“Max!” I ran towards the edge. I didn't care if Matt shot me anymore, I leaned over the edge to see Max lying on the ground unconscious, a pool of blood was widening around him. Colessa appeared underneath and ran to his aid.

Good she was there. I turned to see Matt slowly aiming the weapon at me.


“You killed him!” I said, “How dare you” I rushed over to stop him. 

Matt was expressionless. When my punch connected his cheek became a concave and eyes looked back at me. He fell a few steps back then laughed.

“He was brave, but he had no idea that was coming”

“You sick psychopath” I ran up to him to bring the gun out of his hands.

He laughed, at first he was clueless, but it was like my words began to tick in his head and were echoed through. He aimed the gun at me, holding it loosely like a key chain dangling from his fingers. “You're as scary as a fly that's landed in my coffee.” He shot and his eyes blinked as he shot. He frowned and looked over the gun at me.

“You hurt?” he said.

I shook my head, “You're a terrible shot”

He laughed, “That's what Lacey used to say to me, you know, at night”

“I got it...”

I heard screaming downstairs, Max must have been found.

Matt dropped his gun in front of my face, then he sat down against the wall and stared up into the sky. “Do you have any weed?” he said.

I ignored him, he was so useless.


“Don't go down there” he said, “I need you to stay here with me. Answer me, why are you protecting me”

I tried to relax knowing that Colessa was taking care of Max.

“I was sent here because it would be a good education for me” I said, “I never learned much about stuff, so I could learn now. Even if it's a little late”

Matt fell for it like a guillotine. “And do you have any idea of how many angels go to school?” he said.

“None” I said. “I'm the only one who came to a human place to study” I thought he was going to reply about what I said but he didn't. He stood up, something fell out of his pocket and he picked it up. He looked up at the sky, as if it was going to rain, and moved his shoes towards the door. It was only for a short moment but I saw what it was, before his hand wrapped around it. There was a packet of white powder in his right pocket

“How did you know I was an angel?” I said

“Because I hate your kind, it's simple” 

Now that there was no audience, no one else to buffer things between us, Matt and I were having a conversation. Well it was hardly a conversation, this guy didn't talk much, I was barely getting a response from him, but at least he was saying something?

“So you recognize all angels?”

“I like to think so” He didn't speak much and moved around constantly like a sound wave bouncing around the room.


“Why do you hate us?”

“I don't have to explain anything to your kind”

I saw a very shallow person. He insulted angels without any reason for hating them. He didn't explain himself, and he didn't care.

“Yes you do” I said.

“Why”

“Because you're hurting our race” I saw Max smiling at me, I saw Colessa with her big ideals living her life as much as she could. Then I saw bullets raining from the sky and flattening the people, making the world hollow. “Not just our race, but me, it hurts when you talk about me like that”

When he still didn't answer, I ran over to pick up the gun and held it to him with both hands pointing at her chest. “Answer me” I said.

He didn't look phased, he didn't look nervous, he didn't look like anything. How did this pathetic creature cause me so much distress?
 
“I'm wordless” he shrugged, “You stole all the words right out of my mouth.”

“Tell me” I shook the gun at his neck, it slimed up and down, his neck was greasy from the distinguished disgusting that his body released. “Explain to me why we have to suffer at your whims”


“You haven't suffered yet” Matt said, “If I had my way I would just be starting, I would burn all of you then dump you in cold water and let all of the scars settle. Then I'd burn you again. I want to look for your family members and make them watch closely as I rape you in front of them, making them watch every detail.” He was looking up at the sky again, imagining everything. The clouds became deformed ideas populating his mind. I jabbed the gun into him to try and get him to stop. Just stop talking, stop thinking, stop everything.

“If you want” he said, “You can shoot my balls off” he said, “Then you can have my sperm, that's all you guys want anyway right? You can have it all. You don't need men in this world, you angels can survive by yourself. You can have little me's running around the world and shooting it up for you as you wish.”

“Bang bang”, I shot him twice, once in the ribs and once in his forearm. He kneeled over instantly and started groping the wounds, like a dancer wearing her heels for the first time.

I dropped the gun in shock. The barrel of the gun had smoke lashing out into the air, dancing to run away.

I was morbid, I was disgusting, I was uncontrollable. “Oh my gosh” I said, “Does it hurt? Are you okay?” I leaned down, Matt was biting his lip and holding his arm like a cradle. 
“You b****” he said, “You shot me, you actually made me bleed”

I didn't know what to do, in the moment I had accidentally hurt him, at the moment I just wanted him dead, there was no denying it. My finger circled the trigger, my fingerprints were probably all over the gun. Now after it happened, I was afraid. I was an angel, I was supposed to bring life into the world, not take it.

“Sorry” I said, “I'm sorry, I'll go get help”

He screamed, “That hurts, seriously, aren't you supposed to be healing people? What are you doing.” The blood he coughed up instantly stained into the pores of the concrete and coagulated into a permanent mark, like graffiti.

I dropped the gun in fear, hearing it clanging onto the ground like a metal toy. I ran downstairs. There was a crowd standing outside the Nurse's room. “Colita, what happened?” Everyone was talking, 


“Is a man in there?”

“A man was dead, she carried a dead man in” 

“Who”

“Colessa”

I pushed through the crowd into the room, a curtain was drawn across the bed with a  shocked nurse holding a shaking tray in her hands. Colessa was collapsed on the bed breathing heavily. She looked at me as I came in, her eyes spoke of irritation, AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING? YOU FINALLY DECIDED TO COME.

“Sorry” I winced at her gaze, “I was on the roof with Matt”

“Seriously Colita, I barely managed to save him, his injuries were really bad. He had  friggen bullets in his brain and chest. I didn't know what was up, it was all I could manage to just keep him alive.”

“Matt shot him” I said.

“Matt what?” She tried to sit up, but fell back in her chair. “Matt shot him?”

“Matt and Jason have been carrying around guns in school”

“What's wrong with them? What's wrong with you? Why couldn't you help me? Did you know how hard it was just now for me? Where were you when I needed you the most, we needed you the most. You know that Max was shot right? But you still made me do everything while you were just on the roof talking and flirting with Matt.”

She had obviously head that I was on the roof from someone and was now yelling at me about it, “Colessa” I said, “Matt tried to shoot me as well” It didn't get through to her, her anger blotted out my words. She wasn't able to listen to me.

“This is a job” she said, “Look at all I'm doing to cover for you, we're supposed to dedicate an equal amount to this mission.”

My head sunk, why couldn't she just listen? Since it was a job, she should never yell at a colleague, it was unprofessional and derogatory. 

Even if she hated me.

“Do you have a problem?” she captured my gaze and threw it back ten times stronger.

“No” I guess telling her wouldn't change anything. It would just give her more reason to dislike me in the future.

“Ohhh, you can tell me anything Colita” she suddenly acted all soft and fluffy. When I looked up she was smiling, her fomgers were caressing my hand. 

“Okay” I said, “If I ever have something to say, then I will tell you” I knew that telling Colessa anything meant that she would use it against me or blurt it out like nobody's business. She never respected my opinions, I hated how she kept pretending we were best friends, to her friends were just more toys to control and manipulate.

Her brows shrunk and grew. “It's just that I really need you to help me when things like this happen, this was almost a crisis okay? I can't handle everything by myself. We're in this job together”

“Okay” I muttered.

“Good, I'm glad we came to this understanding. You need to speak up and tell me what's happening. So many times I've been doing all the work and you come in late, or you just misuse your powers, this is a job, we need to follow the rules, would you like it if I just ran off to do my own things all the time?”


“No” I had entered silent response mode, using the minimum amount of energy and sound to get me through this waste of time.

“How would you feel if you were kept in the dark while I knew everything that was happening on the mission? Would it feel good?”

“No”

“Well, I hope that from now we can do a better job together”

“Yes”

“What's wrong?” Her necklace had dimmed so she put it back into her shirt. “You've become all quiet. We need to both be open about anything if we want to work together. if there's something you're dissatisfied about then just tell me okay? That's why I'm telling you this now. It may sound harsh, but I'm just trying to help us improve. We can work on it together.”

Was this why Colessa wasn't a top ranked angel? Because she tried and acted like one? Was it because she was so easy to dislike? Was it because she yelled at me without listening to me and without giving any reason? 

Was she so shallow to be unable to see the truth?

“I'm fine” She probably thought I was annoying and didn't say anything to her, but when I tried to, she just got upset and yelled at me. 

“What are you thinking?” she said.

Whenever I tried to act nice and talk to her she either used me, or she just got mad at me. She seemed constantly frustrated, maybe that's why she spread rumors about me when she first came to the school. She was unpredictable, one moment wanting attention, and then next moment throwing it away. One moment acting like my best friend, and then the next moment acting like I never existed. There was no way I could trust her anymore.

“About life” I held Max's hand, he didn't move, but if he did I knew he would support me. “Just about this long life”

When I approached her about it, she was nonchalant, like nothing had ever happened, like everything was cool. Like I was weird for taking her jokes seriously. Couldn't she see that we were a team? Her dislike of me would only lead to me being taken down. Her dislike of me spread like a laugh.

I really needed her support.

Something more important that I had forgotten came to mind.

“Umm, Colessa...?”

She finished the last of Max's bandages and made me hold the other end. Then lay back down I her seat, tired and raising her feet to rest on the station. Her legs were spread and I could see her panties, but she was loose because there were no guys here.

“Matt shot Max, so I shot Matt” 

There was silence. In that silence I shook with an anticipation of the scolding to come. But it lasted even longer, Colessa twisted around once or twice, then she leaned back in the chair and exhaled long and loud like an air conditioner.

“What” she said, adjusting her hair back down, then she looked at me and moved it back up. “What did you say?”

“I might have...shot Matt”

Her hair was tied up, her eyes were closed, and her anger was released before her response emerged. “You might have...what Colessa?”

“I may or may not have shot Matt”

“Is this a joke?” she said, “Is this one big joke that everyone in the world, but me can't see? You shot the person one person who is the goal of our mission? Just after I told you to pull your socks up?”

“I may have” I said.

“Well if you may have, then is he hurt right now?”
“If I shot him, then he would be hurt, but if I didn't, then he wouldn't be...” I felt dumb while saying it, but it was easier than saying what really happened.

### Chapter Forty One A - Colessa the Dictionary

Umm...so....what just happened? Who...what...where...when...why?

What happened was that Colessa ran out after giving me a bad stare. I was causing her more trouble than good. And she didn't trust me to take care of Matt anymore.

In my eyes Colessa had evolved as I got to work with her. She went from a sensual nonchalant popular girl, into a hardworking responsible adult who followed rules and was loyal. What she said matched what she did. In was only in moments of crisis that I got to see her become so strong. And I wondered if I would be able to do the same if I was placed in a crisis as well. Did I have hidden strength that came out at the end of ends?
 
What I said evolved with who I was, but I never evolved much to be able to say anything worth much.

When Colessa came back, her eyes were on fire. But I could tell she was trying to hide it. She stomped past me and went back to her seat, her necklace hung out, she let it settle before putting it back into her shirt. It was standard angel practice. If the necklace was left out, it might damage your body, so even if it was a risk of being seen with the necklace, angels still left their necklaces out until they cooled down. Our  necklaces were more important than our identity.
Colessa assumed the position she had been at, I was still sitting in the same place, with one hand on Max and another hand in my lap.

“Don't touch him” Colessa said, “He's still tired”

“Okay, sorry” I removed my hand and also placed it on my lap, like a child. Colessa's tone was mean, like she didn't want me touching Max because she had healed him and not me. But she was probably also tired and and at me because she had done two revives in a row and it was partly my fault.


“He's fine now, in case you were wondering. So our mission is still on.” I admired how she cared about the mission so much. I was sure that before coming here she never complained about the mission being long, or that she wanted something more challenging, she just did what needed to be done. It was a noble characteristic that she possessed and I could only admire her from afar.

“How about Max?” I stepped carefully through my words, any mis-step would aggravate her dramatically “Would Max be upset that we healed Matt after he was shot by him?”

“Max knows more than anyone that this mission is all about Matt. There are literally hundreds of replacements for us angels, only a fraction of people who possess the talents for it actually become angels. But there is only one Matt, he is unique in the world. So he is more important than us. 

“But he shot Max” I said, “He is horrible to people around him and hates angels even more. He won't cooperate with us”

“Trust me” she said, “Max would do the same as I did, okay? Understood?” 

This was the end of the conversation, Colessa said it like it was. I wondered if Colessa had ever worked with Mirana or Carlotta, or the other top class angels, is that why she was so serious and capable? I looked at Max lying on the bed calmly. What did he think about all of this? Had he been shot before? 

I had been with Max, but I realized I didn't know anything about him, when I saw Colessa protecting him, when I saw angels completing their missions and taking everything seriously I felt unimportant and left out.

Maybe that was why I hadn't saved Julia. Because of my own selfishness, because I was too bothered in what she was doing to me and not actually thinking about what I could do for her.

“What are you thinking?” Colessa said. She was collapsed on the couch with her hair covering her face. The light was right above her and cast a shadow like a pair of goggles over her eyes, dipping at the cheeks and rising at the sides. When she moved her hair away and tilted her head forward, the light ran up her head and onto the couch.

“You know that girl?” I said. “I know this isn't about Max, or Matt, or you, or Jason, or Nathan, but it's what I was thinking about”

“Okay, go ahead” She was surprisingly welcome.

“Do you remember Julia?” I said.

“Sure” Colessa shrugged, “It wasn't that long ago, I went to the funeral.”

Before I explained anything Colessa gasped, “Don't tell me you think it's your fault do you?” She was tired but she got up and came over. “It's not your fault she died okay? That girl was sick, she attempted suicide so multiple times; she was a depressive, it's not your fault at all, don't blame yourself, you absolutely can't do that”

I was speechless, I never expected such caring words to come out of Colessa, but they did. And I was touched. 

“It also takes away your focus from the mission, you were acting for your own benefit, and for Matt's benefit, you couldn't keep assisting her, that's no an angel's job. An angel's job is to heal, or course, but if taken to an excess, even healing can prove negative and become a toxin.”

Oh my gosh, that was so true. I never thought of it like that. It was something we learned in our early classes, but when Colessa repeated it I felt saved.

“You can't change what's happened” she said, “You have to move on with your life, we all do, and there's no point in everyone moving on while you're being left behind. In life we all have to progress at the same rate, or else something is lost and forgotten”

I looked at the nursing bed that Max lay in. The curtain was drawn across, and if I looked hard enough at the duvet I might see a hair or two of mine from a few weeks ago when Julia had been lying here in the same bed, dead.

Yesterday, or an hour ago, even two minutes ago I had been fine. But just like a car crash the loneliness surged out of nowhere and crashed into me. Not in a noble way, like the sea onto a jagged cliff face, but like a car completely decimating a person. A nuclear bomb stripping the landscape of its clothing.

I missed Julia all of a sudden, I had to be careful or else this would become uncontrollable. Everywhere I went around school Julia just followed me and I never thought twice, but now she wasn't there, when I turned around she wasn't behind me. When I met friends Julia always stood beside me quietly sapping in everything we said then afterwards we talked about it and she would give me her opinion quietly. Today, suddenly, I really, missed Julia. A few weeks ago right now, I would have been healing her and kissing her, and then we walked back to class hand in hand. She was gone now.

Colessa looked at me wildly, I guess she was trying to understand me. I was an irresponsible and useless colleague. But to me, she was the same. With her felt normal, we did things normally together. As soon as we argued I started to really miss Colessa more.

But I coudln't tell her that, it was too touchy, besides, we were colleagues, and that was something that wouldn't be said.

I wanted to hug her, because we had argued just now. On some days I felt weird with her, on some days we felt very close. And when we had argued, I coudln't say anything to her, and it felt weird. I don't know what made the feeling eventually disappear, but something would heal it. Something out of our angel powers.

But on good days, for some reason, maybe it was just me, maybe it was just Colessa, maybe it was both of us, or maybe it was something else, a third party out of our control, but then I could say ANYTHING to her. On those days Colessa knew everything about me and she was very special. Then even when Julia wasn't here I wasn't unhappy at all, because I had Colessa protecting me and keeping me safe. I saw her and felt welcome, and like I had somewhere to go. Even when I argued with Matt, even when I was suffering about Julia, even when I was trying to act popular but others insulted me, I could run back to Colessa and I knew that she would always welcome me with open arms. Although I was weird sometimes, and sometimes very mean and insensitive; no matter what happened, Colessa was always there for me, and it was the sweetest thing in the world. She listened to me wholeheartedly, letting my pain sink into hers, letting my joy be shared with her. Because she was also an angel and knew everything.

Even though I needed her more than she needed me, she never came to me running for help, or needed me to sort out her emotional mess. She always gave and gave to me. 

“You know what Jason said?” Colessa knew what I was thinking, and she knew what to say right now. I knew what she was going to say was going to be relevant. “Angels are too addicted to nurturing, we are timid and tender, and because of it, sometimes we are taken advantage of.” 

“And that's what Jason said? How does he know about us?”

“Mm Hmm” she nodded, “He's quite surprising sometimes, he comes up with all this nonsense about the stupidest stuff, then next moment he says something so unexpectedly brilliant that can break the even the strongest women down into tears because of its raw truth. It's really amazing, because it gives me faith in people again, that even brute concrete guys like him can have affection.”

She then gave me a hug, “Jason is a nice person, I want to think that everyone is”

“Why do you think that?” I said.

“Because people are all different” she said, “And even when we're so different and so unique and selfish, we still manage to all get along together pretty well don't you think?”

“But inside, we're all the same” I said.

“It depends on if you look at the surface of a person or the inside? We all have a nose and two eyes and a noisy loud mouth, but that doesn't mean that we're the same does it? But we also all have insecurities and pleasures that we hide don't we? Does that make us mean that we are the same?”

“Yes” I said. I had heard it before, it's what we learnt when we were learning to become angels. It was the reasoning for the moral basis of our actions, why did angels heal others. Was it because they wanted to make themselves fele better in doing so? Or was it because they loved everyone else more? Some scholars dedicated their life to this question and came out of it more puzzled than less. Everyone held their respects to these philosophers, but nothing really came from it. If they could solve that one last problem, then everything would be unravelled, or so they believed. It was a story as old as desire.

Colessa skimmed through my thoughts and came to a conclusion, “So I think we are all remarkable and pretty nice people, at least that's my explanation” 

“Then can I ask you” I said, “I don't mean to be rude and rock the boat, I'm just curious”

She let loose her grip, “Go ahead, you know you can ask me anything”

“What about our mission? What if I wanted to heal someone who was outside the mission, but also needed healing? It's against the rules, but isn't it good to do so? If the angel has enough energy then it's okay right?”

Colessa sighed, “Is this about you healing Julia?” It's alright” she said. “I'm not mad about it at all”

Meaning that she had indeed once been mad about it. “I always wondered about the rules, why can we only heal who is related to the mission? There are so many others in the peripheries who are in need. It's like we provide an umbrella to one person and leave everyone else out in the rain. Or like watching a football game and seeing the players and disregarding the audience, forgetting that they also have talents that are worthy of watching.” 

“I kind of get what you're saying” Colessa stepped back and sat on the couch, crossing her legs. “Do you want to discuss this? I really like your umbrella analogy, I think that is spot on”

I nodded, “I always thought about this, and I haven't had the chance to work with other angels much before so...”

“Okay” she said, “Well I think that the whole thing about only protecting the subject of your mission is also to do with discipline, it's to respect the sacredness of the mission, as well as the respect the hierarchies of angels. Our boss is Max, and he told us to protect Matt, so that's what we should be doing with utmost respect and concern. It's our foremost reason for being here, everything else, like chatting and making friends, going out socializing, or even your own time, should come second to protecting Matt. I like to see it as a reason for why we exist, if we're not angels, then we're not important for this job are we?” She took the light switch and swithced it off. The sunlight immediately penetrated in and Max's face became of sculpture of smooth shade and smooth light. “See?” she said, “Everything changed the moment we switched the light off, now when I switch it on again...” It clicked into place, and the somber sunlight disappeared, covered and throttled by the light source above us. “I like to see the angel's pathway as a sacred one, and when we do what is right, the light is on, and everything suddenly makes sense. But when it is off, there are shades and uncertainties around us. That's why I think we should follow the mission with an almost sacred loyalty and trust, because that will lead us to the right way. Even if it isn't the right way, because it's in the organization, it will eventually lead us to good. So I trust and listen to whatever Max tells us, and he trusts in those angels higher than him.”  

“But” I said, “What if I really want to heal someone else, what if I really want to do something different?”

“Then you can discuss it with someone first” she said, “Then try to find a solution”

“But what if they say no and I still really want to do it, because it feels like I'm being loyal to myself, if I don't do it, then I feel like I'm cheating myself?”

“Then...” Colessa paused, “Well, do you know that sheep story from second year? I think that's a good answer to your question.”

“Yes, but please go on” I said,


“The sheep never knows that it is following others. All it's life it never sees the scenery, only the other sheep around it. So all of its actions naturally fit the other sheep that it is surrounded by. These sheep don't know where they live, they just live in comfort day and night. The ones on the side all want to be in the safety of the middle of the herd, and the more they act like the middle of the herd, the more they can go to the middle of the herd.”

“I remember” I said.

“And do you also remember how the sheep in the middle of the herd are always the same? You're in the middle” she said, “You want to go to the outside”

“I'm on the outside” I said, “You're in the middle”

Colessa changed her legs and recrossed and uncrossed and recrossed them. “No? Um...you're in the middle?”

“But I'm kind of always doing my own thing” I said, “That's why...”

She interrupted me, sharp enough to let me know I was wrong, “No, I was saying that everyone is in the herd, and you're in it as well,. And us angels need to break free from the inside and live our own lives on the outside. It's just interpretation, we mean the same thing” she shrugged

“No” I said, “I think it's... because everyone like you guys are all following the rules.” It was pointless, I didn't need to finish the sentence, we both saw as ourselves as more original and more interesting. She probably thought I was boring and quiet and had no moral choices to guide my way. But it was the sheep in the middle who followed. Probably everyone took offense easily, everyone thought that they were unique and doing good.

Colessa took offense at that. She came over and hugged me, but it felt unnatural and controlling and manipulative. “You don't like me do you? That's why you're giving me a hard time with this mission, you know what to do, but you deliberately don't want to do it”


“That's not true” I said, “I'm doing things my own way as well”

Do you hate it? Am I hurting you?” she tightened her hug. "You held Julia, so I want you to hold me as well, in the same way."

Ahhh, I realized what it was, maybe she was jealous of Julia, maybe she was jealous of me? Maybe she was jealous of the close relationship that we had had. I don't know, which, jealousy slippery and slimy like the mold on the cap of a milk bottle, it was hard to point out which it was. But I got the vague feeling of a dissatisfaction wafting forth from Colessa.  

“I can feel this” I said, “Because I'm free” I said. “I chose to heal her all those times, don't you think that's a good thing?”

Colessa let me go and looked at me calmly. Her hair settled beside her like willow branches coming in from a soft breeze. “I know” she said, “But not all affection is good, and sometimes when we are too affectionate we forget the purpose of why we are doing things, we are just following our passions and swinging to and fro, like a candle when you move your hand around it and it casts shadows that dance over the world...”

“I know” I said, I really did know what she was saying. Because I had read it all before, it came up in the textbooks that we had studied in class. I kept pressing a point to her, but now I realized that she didn't know.

“Us angels all came from the same weak source” she said, “So we need to support each other with strong intentions and steadfast direction.”

The more I looked at her, the harder I concentrated, I saw the title of our three year  comprehensive textbook 6th edition plastered across her forehead. I'd done enough reading for a lifetime.

“Isn't that right?” she said, “So we should respect everyone around us, especially those with more experience and who have lived their lives with more failures, so it allows them to have more wisdom. That's why I follow these rules and you should too.”


Now I didn't know who to agree with, this feeling I was having inside, or dissatisfaction; or to listen to Colessa and live my life the way I always had been living, in the safety of the rules set up for us.

I smiled, “You're not hurting me Colessa”

### Chapter Forty One B - Colita the Dictionary

“Why should I be hurting you?” Colessa said. “I'm just trying to show you my view on how things work in the angel community, how we were raised and did things, how we all live our lives to their fullest and utmost importance. And if you want to live your life to the fullest, you need to know why, why we exist”

She paused and looked up, because I was also looking up. There was a poster on the wall of the upcoming Prom. It was the pinnacle of High School, yet we had been so distracted that we hadn't noticed it approaching. Max was the furthest possible object from Prom.

The whole time we had been talking, the poster of Prom was sitting on the wall like a stalker, watching and listening to us.

I was glad Colessa and I hadn't started anything that we might later be embarrassed about.

“If you could give Prom a shape, what shape would it be?”

“If you could give it an animal, what would it be?”

“Well, Prom is, and has always been a turkey to me.”

Colessa nodded, “Exactly what I was thinking!”

“Great minds think alike” I said, “Because the Turkey is always clueless and aloof, so it's like” I made some hand gestures to which Colessa immediately caughton and followed. 

“Wow, I never knew you and I were so weird” Colessa blushed after we both finished.

“Everyone's weird once they're alone for long enough”

The conversation skewered everything and came to a halt at angels again. It seemed so surreal, but the poster was still there. No matter what we talked about, the poster still hung there impressionable smiling, like it knew something that we didn't.

“We're in high school” I said, “When we talk about angels and stuff, I feel like we're not really living in high school properly.”

“It's fine, don't overthink it, we're just here for a mission anyways, don't get too attached, be detached from it”

I also felt like Colessa and other angels usually never really noticed their surroundings, wherever they went, they were kind of always angels, instead of the place they were. I thought that I was more like water, always taking the form and shape of the place I was in, and collapsing when I was left without surroundings. For better or for worse, that's what I always thought.

I wondered if we would still be here from Prom, and if we went, would we go with one of the boys? Would they want to go to their last dance with an angel? To us it was just a mission, but to them it was part of their life. 

The poster stayed hanging the whole time not budging. There was a picture of last year's Prom King and Queen on the face, they were smiling, eternally joyful. Just like the people on Keats' Grecian Urn. They were influenced by Keats after all. And Keats had some use to us after all.

“How come you don't answer Colita? What are you thinking about, tell me”

“Nothing” I said

“Are you mad? Because if you're mad, then you need to tell me”

“I'm not, I'm just thinking”

“About what?”

“Umm...just about everything”

“Do you want to talk more about angels and things? Do you have any more questions that I can try and answer for you?”

I shook my head, “To be honest, because let's be totally honest here, in brutal honesty, I think that maybe I've heard most of the things that you say in text books before. We learnt about it, I learnt about it with you, all angels did.”

I tried to weaken my words with a smile, but Colessa wasn't watching, the damage had been done. I immediately regretted saying anything at all. We all needed to say what we thought, everyone needed to release a certain amount of honesty every day,. But this particular situation hadn't been correct.


But she had practically forced it out of me. 

Colessa blew up, but not really, she didn't really show it. She never said I was wrong, but her words pierced me so hard that guilt was irrepresible.

“Everything you say” she said, “It's not from the textbooks, it's from my heart. But my heart has read all sorts of different books about all sorts of different things, nothing I can say is any more original. And I'm sorry if I bore you with my opinions that happen to coincide with what has been written in books. But ideas are written in books for a reason, and that reason is a very persuasive one.”

She didn't stop there, the hairs on her tongue were standing from the dryness of her words, “Because that's what you're saying right? That you are more original, you have more independence and respectability because what you are saying has been repeated lby others less often.”

The hairs on her tongue slipped down, and that was the gist of it, out. “You're also in a library Colita, it may be a different section of the library to where I am, but that's all. You have to look up and know that you're in a library, or you really don't know anything. It's not bad to be the sheep in the middle fo the herd, they are the most clueless and never realize that they are in the middle anyway.”

She spoke so much that I lost what she was saying, but I say her tongue spit in and out like a snake, and I knew she wasn't meaning to be pleasant. As I said, she never really showed it, no one ever did.

It was a high class way of insult from Colessa to me. But instead of getting upset, I chose to appreciate it; because her straightforward steadfastness though was something rare in our culture, whether angel or human.

### Chapter Forty Two - Lacey the Rival

Because of Julia's absence, (that was how Mr. Gilbert put it), Lacey was conveniently placed beside me in math class.

The convenience went both ways. Lacey gave me her best smile, reminding me that she was indeed the most pleasant and wonderful girl in school, and that nothing had ever happened between us.

Ah math, it was a ceasefire.

Lacey first bit into me after we handed our work to Mr. Gilbert at the end of class.

“I know you want to sleep with Matt again” she said.

“Oh do I?” That was news to me.

“Yes” she growled, but of course it looked like a smile. She had about fifteen different expressions hidden in a smile. And if I was careful, I would overlook it and think they were all the same smile. Sometimes she even hid two emotions inside one smile, and it was only through a keen eye for observation and a deep understanding of human muscular tendencies that I was able to distinguish these hidden expressions.

“That's why Julia killed herself” Lacey said. “Because of you”|

I didn't know how that made sense, but she had just crossed the line. I kicked my chair back and stood up, then sat down when everyone looked, I smiled back at her “What did you say?”

“She wanted your attention” Lacey said. “I remember, because she was my rival”

“Rival?”

Lacey didn't smile anymore, she sighed, that was the first look of less than perfection that I had seen in this girl. It must have been hard work to keep yourself polished constantly so that you sparkled from all angels.

“Julia, I miss her” she said, “Her and I both wanted the same thing, attention from you. It's just that we tried to get it in different ways. That's why she was my fellow rival, and we both worked together to become worse people together.”

“Lacey...” I was stunned, this confession had come out of nowhere. Was Lacey always this spontaneous and unpredictable?

“I remember her vividly” Lacey said, “Because of that, now that she's gone, I can just step over you easily and there's nothing else”

Lacey was the first person who mentioned Julia's name, and went beyond mentioning her name. When she spoke of Julia, it was like I was awakening from a dream, a dream where I had been the only one able to see Julia, but now she had come into everyone's lives.

“I feel like everyone is in the middle of the herd” Lacey said

“In the middle...? Hehehe, of the herd?” I was hearing this a lot recently.


“Yeah, but Julia and I were kind of walking on the outside together, everyone else, they're so boring, they just do this and that and that and this and they do the same things everyday and let the same things happen to them everyday. They just kind of...exist, you know what I mean? But I feel like we were on the edge and really exploring things, and somehow changing where the herd went.”

“Hum, Okay” I said, I wasn't sure if it was Julia's or Colessa's words Lacey was repeating, but one of them had had an influence over her. Our words survived longer than we did, even if they were the same words.

“Everyone is telling me different things about that” I said, “I don't know what the truth is, where the middle of the herd is, and what if the landscape you are looking at is actually also a part of the herd”

“No way” Lacey said, “No way, that can't be, listen to yourself!”

We were talking about herds, like the memories of Julia were living on. Lacey's rival had influenced her the most, more than anyone else. It meant that Julia had changed the world somehow, even if it was just a tiny bit.


Lacey organized for me to meet her after lunch. Dyring lunch she still sat with Matt and Jason, Nathan came over to my table, it was the same. But afterwards we had a rendezvous at the primary school cafeteria. 

The tables were tiny here, and the chairs made our knees squish together. All around us were noisy primary school kids yelling and grabbing for food, and screaming and crying for milk from the teacher's teats.

Lacey arrived with no smile. There was no one she was afraid of being judged by here. The jury was out.

“I know you're an angel okay?” she opened with a dramatic statement.

“Oh do you?”

“You can stop pretending, everyone in school knows”

“Okay” I said, “I will stop, but that doesn't mean I'm not human right?” The stage was still open, I could still perform all I wanted to. There was still an audience who were listening and watching.

“The reason why no one has done anything” Lacey said, 

“Because I'm nice?” I said.

She laughed, “No, because Matt has convinced everyone that he will get rid of you”

“How did Jason find out?” I said.

“I don't know, but he said he heard it from someone, like inspiration or something. He gets a bit of stuff from here and there, like a fruit salad.”

It felt good to be sitting here with Lacey. It was only after we shared a few sentences and started talking to each other that I felt it, but I was glad to be able to talk with her. She knew I was an angel but still talked to me. 

That meant that she thought I was human.

Among the primary school kids who were yelling and making faces and throwing food, we talked about everything. When we both sat down to it, I don't think either of us expected the conversation to be so concise and connected, but I felt it strongly. We were like a boat sitting out in an ocean full of noisy children.

“I'm always afraid of being disliked” Lacey said

“Why are you telling me this?” I said, 

“Because I feel like you understand” she said. “You've been through it all before, and besides, you might no be here for much longer, I wouldn't be able to tell anyone else who is going to stay here for a long time.”

“I'm not afraid of that” I said.

“That's why I want to tell you” she said, “I try to talk to everyone, try to control everyone, because that way I know what everyone is saying, and that no one is saying anything bad about me. If everyone likes me, then everyone is happy. But you didn't like me.” She pointed at me, there was some potato mash on the end of her finger on her nail. She looked around and sucked it off. “That's why I said Julia was my rival”

“For me” I said, “What's most scary is that people will treat me differently because I'm an angel, then it means that I'm not worth being treated the same”

“Are you just saying that, or do you actually mean it?”

“I mean it” I said.

She nodded, our understanding was so simple, and it had come across with so little words that it was like we were two men planning a day out.


Up till now I was sure it was only us angels able to talk about deep things, because we had the same problems, but now on talking with Lacey I saw that humans did as well. Everyone held deep topics of moral conflict, like religion, or ways of life travelling with them. It was something to question angel life. But it was something else to question life.

Lacey told me how she had problems with her sister, her sister was always copying what she did. And sometimes she even tried to solve her problems for her. She told me how she had had problems with anorexia and self esteem. She would try to get skinny so that guys would stare, but then it became an addiction and a fear.e

(Lacey and Colita say the exact same thing, but it means completely different things)
They answered the interview in the exact same way????

She told me how she needed Matt, but whenever she got close to him then she didn't care about him anymore, he was like a painting by Monet, dotted and ugly up close, but beautiful from far away.

She told me how she was a paradox, worried about her grades and her future career, but also completely confident that she would make it as a fashion designer.

So I said, “Don't start thinking negatively. Because if you do, then you start living in your head and dragging yourself lower and lower with everything you do. You have a place in this world, every single person does”

She told me how she was always sad when her friends teased her for something, but laughed like they had just given her a compliment, because telling them she was hurt made her vulnerable and embarrassed. She just wished she could be honest and sincere and open with them without worrying about what they thought of her. But at the same time she wished that she could hide everything and not have to tell anyone anything, then everyone could judge her and it wouldn't be true or real anyway, so it didn't matter.

I told her that I didn't know she thought so much. I told her that I thought it was just me who did so.


She said that she knew everyone was unique and beautiful, and tried to be herself, but as soon as she thought that, she wanted to be a part of the crowd and fit in. 

Then I wondered if these kids around us who were growing up so fast would one day also talk about this kind of thing. Was it something that everyone had to go through to grow up?

And when you grew up enough, you died.

A little girl waltzed over from her kiddie table to ours. She had ponytails that swung like seesaws on her head. My eyes moved right and left as I watched them. She tapped Lacey on the shoulder. 

Lacey was astonished, and then not so astonished when she saw who it was.

“You're very pretty Ms.” she said

Lacey spoke slowly and smiled and nicely, “Thank you” 

Of all of Lacey's smiles, this was the first time that I saw her genuine smile, the smile that wasn't hiding or manipulating, or communicating something extra. And then for a second Lacey looked like a little kid. She had her arms cheeks wrapped in happiness and was ready to go to the playground.
After the little girl left, she turned to me with a sigh, seeing me brought her back to who she was, and how the chair was too small for her.

“So, should we go?” she smiled. But it wasn't the same....it just wasn't the same.

As soon as we stood up the moment was gone. As soon as we mentioned Matt or angels, or anything, then our closeness evaporated into a thousand distant stars.

That smile of happiness was so easy to make, but it was so hard to find. Why did  happiness have to be so hard to find?

### Chapter Forty Three - Colita the Mother

I heard that Matt was so surprised when the injured Max came back healed. Then he realized that we must have been angels and became addicted to these new toys.

“Therefore...” Colessa said, “Be careful, because now he not only knows you, but knows me as well, so **** is going down.”


I laughed, “What can go down more than this? Our mission is a disaster, Max was shot, and I shot our target”

Colessa glared at me, she still had the scar from it the other day. “Matt is recovering in the bed next to Max's but they don't know that the other is there, so keep it quiet, we don't want anything funny happening.

“Couldn't you find another room?” I said.

She glared at me again, wow, she looked like a Hurricane.

It gave a friendly smile and left the room, great job, it just so happened that there were only two beds in the nurse's room. And through some great decision making Max  and his assailant, Matt, were placed in the same room together to recover.

The students had been sent back to their classes, so I walked in the nurse's room with my yellow slip giving me permission to leave. Mr. Gilbert just gave me one straight away without asking for reasons. Either he was still feeling guilty about us, or he wanted to solidify our relationship. With a yellow nurse's slip...

Who knew what men were thinking? Who ever knew what went through their head on the rare occasion that it wasn't sex. They were clumsy and noisy most of the time, but still had to argue whenever someone else did something wrong.

If men were more like women, what a wonderful world we would have. 

Colita, you're only thinking this because you want to experience being a human right?

I popped my head, I was talking to myself again...

I swung open the curtain, I didn't know who was inside, but I was hoping to see Max.

Matt looked back at me with a tired face. “Colita” he said, “You shot me”

Great, that was a wonderful start to my day. Congrats on the smooth introductions.

He sunk back down into the bed like it was a pair of soft wings. “I thought the other angel was Julia” he said, “I never expected it to be Colessa”


He was a joke, is that why he made Julia suffer? His male instinct told him that Julia was the angel? 

He made it worse, “Colessa asked me why I gave Julia so much attention, she played it well, she completely disguised herself, I had no idea. I told her that I thought Julia was an angel”

“Wait, you're saying Colessa knew?” If this was true, it meant that Colessa had almost knowingly let Julia die.”

“She's a coward” Matt said, “She didn't havethe guts to come out and admit that it wasn't Julia, it was her.”


And just like that, my emotions boiled towards Colessa. As soon as Colessa healed and saved Matt suddenly all everyone cared about was Colessa. Colessa this, Colessa that, no one did anything but talk about her, didn't they have any sense at all? She was a phony. I recognized the old weakness welling up inside me, a weakness I hadn't felt for so long that I thought it had been conquered.

“Colessa healed Max, that's how I knew” he said. “he was supposed to be dead. It's a pity” he thought about it, “Or an excitement...depends on how you look at it.”


“You're kidding right?” I said. “Do you know that I used to date Max?”

“You're kidding right?” he said, “You dated that dude? What's so good about him.”

“I have known him for so long, we broke up, but we still stay together, because even when we are apart we are basically together”

“That's gross” he gargled and spat a dollop of saliva onto the tiles. It stuck there like chewing gum.

“You can leave now” he said.

I walked the distance of two steps to get to Max's bed.

Max looked up at me with the same weariness that Matt wore. When he spoke, he made sure to do it quietly.

“Our son” he said, “Goes to this school”

“Who's there?” Matt shouted, “In the bed next to me, wanna play some solitaire?”

“Solitaire is a solo game” Max shouted back.

“Right, you're a good dude” Matt said.

Matt gazed at me, “I never told you, but our son goes to this school, he should be about seventeen now.” 

I laughed.

Then I laughed some more.

---

### Chapter Forty Four - Max the Human

So apparently I had a son. That was great, just great and great and great and unbelievably great news.

Max saw my joy, “Sorry I didn't tell you earlier” he said. “I thought you might be upset”

“What, upset at you not telling me? Or upset at you telling me much later? What were you thinking? All this time I thought my son was taken away.” I knelt down on the bed. My son was actually here, I thought about him everyday, but I never ever expected him to be so close.

“What's his name” I said, “Is he handsome?”

“I don't know who he is” Max said. “But I'm sure, being our son and all, he's handsome”

“Does he have the powers?”

“You mean if he's an angel? Unfortunately not, that's why I never recruited him.”

Max had taken control of everything, I didn't want to be involved in it, it was too much for me to care about everything. But now I regretted it. I man should never take care of my baby. He was my baby, men were only good for war. Tourist hotspots were swarming with whole families, but I was never given that chance,  my boy was taken from me before I ever saw him. The closest I got to him when he came out of me, I felt him on my skin, that was it.

That was enough to stop me from forgetting him, ever. Why did I listen to Max? Why did I trust him? Why didn't I break away from what he was doing to me?

“I wanted to talk to you about Colessa” I said.

“Okay” he said, “Our talks have been long overdue”

“Colessa only follows rules, whatever you tell her, she follows it like a train on a railroad. She doesn't know why she follows them, but she always gives me textbook answers at the end that we learnt about”
“Okay” he nodded matter of factly. Like what I was saying either wasn't important, or was something he knew already and was therefore not important.

“So I was questioning the authenticity and personality of those reasons for how she lives her life and her morality. And questioning why I am working with her as well, and how good of a team we would make.”

Max sighed, “Colita, you do this every time, you start complaining about people halfway in” I knew he meant our relationship. “Your true colors show after a while, like a door beginning to creak, or like a  piece of iron that has weathered rain and begun to rust.”

“Can you speak normally?” I said, “I'm not complaining, although you always think I do, I'm just telling you this stuff and you say I'm complaining, it's always the same, get over yourself. Let me just finish okay? Then you can say what you like.”

“Okay” he said, ion the same annoying tone.

“I feel like Colessa's career has overshadowed her personality and squandered it to the extent that she is no longer expressing or doing anything of value, for herself, and for Angel.Corp”

“Angel.Corp?” Max said, “Since when do you care anything about Angel.Corp? You're the most unreliable angel we have, yo're lucky I even gave you this mission in the first place. Now I don't want to hear you insulting Coelssa ever again. Have you properly talked to Colessa? Do you even realize that Colessa is also living her own life to it's fullest and trying her best to be relevant in this world? And frankly she's achieved a whole lot more than what you're doing, which is sitting on the couch day after day and smoking and looking at others without bothering to move by yourself. Colessa is one of the most loyal angels that there are.” Then he added something he didn't have to say, but he obviously wanted me to know, “I trust her a lot more than you”

Stop making worth judgments, comapring us was the worst thing you could do to someone. It made everyone worth less.

“So don't say she's a blind follower” Max said, “You have no right to”


“But she is” 

“That's stupid”

“But it's not” He seemed to dislike anything I said about the other angels. It was like in his mind I was below them, and it kept leaking out in everything that he said and sticking to my shoes. There was negativity from him whenever I described what I wanted to do with my life, or my feelings. If he had always treated me better, then maybe I wouldn't be so messed up and wrong right now. 

Maybe I would feel better and could sit calmly.

Max turned on some music, there were sounds all around us, then they solidified into a beat. 

“Do you know this song?”

“Turn it off!” Matt yelled from behind the curtain.

Max went on, “This song is called Comfortably Numb by an old band called Pink Floyd”

I nodded, it sounded weird and slow. It kept building up

“I make it a point to listen to this song whenever I come to the human world” he said.”And especially now that I'm lying in this bed, I feel it a lot more”

Hello, is there anybody in there,
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?

Come on down, I hear you're feeling down
I can ease the pain, get you on your feet again.

Relax, I need some information first, just the basic facts, can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding, a distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain you will not understand
This is not how I am.

I, I, have become comfortably numb.

“Don't worry about Matt” Max saw me looking cautiously, “A murderer will never listen to music, their mind is silent”

I was shocked, 

“Wouldn't it be wonderful” Max said, “If someone could be a doctor and come up to us and help us? ” He moved his hands back, “Then we could recede further and further back, until we just don't care about anything anymore, nothing matters at all. Time has slipped past, everything has changed behind us and in front of us. You see a lot of action happening over there” he pointed somewhere, “But it's like you have gone beyond it. You know when you're sick, you think about this kind of thing. ”

Max fell quiet, like he was admitting to a big crime, “When I leave the angel world, I feel like all fo the action has stopped, and over here I am just watching it from far away. Basically, this human world is not important to me. I know I shouldn't say this as an angel, but I really don't care about it.” 

He turned the music off. The jumble of words faded, Matt's breathing came back on the other side of the curtain. The big block passed.

“Let me tell you a story...” Max said, “It's about Colessa, something that happened before. She probably hasn't told you, but I think it's important for you to know. You need to know someone's past if you want to work with them.”

---

### Chapter Forty Five - Colessa the Stone

Max carried on with what he wanted to say. I sat down on the bed beside him and touched his hair. It had been so long since we had been like this. The last time was when I was pregnant in bed and he had been taking care of me.

“Colessa used to be like you when she was younger” he said. “You guys are pretty much the same”


“Colessa?” Was he in love with her as well then?

“I met her when she had done about three missions, and guess what, she had failed all three missions as well”

“Colessa failed?”

“And she was proud about it, she kept complaining to me about everything, she always had an excuse for everything.”

I couldn't believe this was Colessa he was talking about. Colessa was the most organized and kind person.

“But one day there was an accident” he said, “She had to protect someone, but because she was doing something else, she made a mistake, and her client was killed”

“Killed?”

“It was unlucky, such a dire consequence is rare, but it happened, and Colessa couldn't recover from it easily. She spent about a month pondering over it, and now she is finally back on track. She is one of our most reliable angels. Behind Mirana of course.”

Even three months in absence of the angel world, just mentioning Mirana's name managed to bring shivers down my spine.


“An experience changes you” Max said.

“Well I would hope so, isn't that the definition of an experience?” If we had to get all technical then I would show him that I could too.

“What I'm saying is that you should respect Colessa for who she is, and maybe you can find something to look up in her for.”

He made it sound like it was all my fault. I wondered how much he had been listening to Colessa. How often did she complain about me to him?


We heard banging and screaming outside. Matt was absent from his bed. The door was being banged. I ran out and swung it open, then A naked Colessa collapsed on the ground, Matt fell over on her as well, his pants were down around his ankles, thrusting like a dog out of control. 


There was an audience behind them, cameras were out, and some girls were trying to stop it. The guys coudln't do anything to Matt.
In front of everyone, Colessa was raped. Max kept asking me what was happening, he could only hear the screaming and then the crying afterwards.

“Nothing” I said, “I'm trying to fix it”

Matt came out of it zipping his pants up like a hero, he turned around and cheered like a madman. But no one replied. It was too much for even them to bear.

Colessa was on the ground, sobbing into her arms. She had never been violated.

Max found out what happened and pulled out his gun. He had one stowed under the covers. But I calmed him down and put underneath the pillow.

“She's an angel” I said, “She can heal herself”

Max tried ot get up but he started coughing. “This is outrageous, I've never seen anything like this.”


Before Max could do or say anything, Matt came back in and lay down in the bed. He was breathing hard and tired. Colessa had run off and the crowd started to thin.

“Is this normal here?” Max said, “Do students get raped?”

It was rape, I hadn't even realized it. But I saw how serious it was when Max started crying. A grown man like him was bawling and melting like a candle.

“I can't stop thinking about it” he said, “A woman can't sink any lower than that, to be taken in front of everyone.” He asked me to bring Colessa over, if I did, then he might like her more than he liked me. I wondered if he would be even sadder if it happened to me? I couldn't Max getting any more emotional. Then I started to question if he cared for me. Even in times like this all I could think about was myself.

He was tormented by thoughts of it, and he wanted to hold her closely to try and reduce the damage. Whenever he stopped, the thoughts reappeared, they were never far behind.

Colessa was dishonored. “I can't do anything about it” Max said, “I'm upset, but I can't do anything. The rules say that I can't touch Matt, we have to protect him.”

Jason gently rubbed Colessa's arms. He had a bucket of red water prepared and spilled it over her, like a pool of blood. She wailed, then returned to her tolerant sobbing.

“I have nothing to say to you” she said. 

Jason didn't care if Colessa was an angel or not, he didn't even care if she was sincere, he picked Colessa up like a baby in his arms and gently rocked her from side to side.

Matt groaned and moved in his bed, “Do what you want with her” he said, like some sort of pre-arranged agreement was converging.

Max closed his lids and embraced himself with his arms. He had rings and rings on his hands and wrists, they were trembling quietly in fear. He was muttering something under his breath to calm him down. It was ancient spell passed down through his ancestors and was misted with his breath which rose and fell.

“What's happening?” Some of my classmates said. She was just outside and I heard her voice stirring on the surface, like the switch on a machine. “Where did he take her?”

“He went into the theatre with her” A guy pointed. I noticed that the guy was just a normal student, he didnt' have any features that stood out, he wasn't attractive, he wasn't smart, he wasn't loud, and he didn't excel at anything. He was just another normal student in the school who was always around. He just existed. Some people were like that, they just existed as packaging to smooth the ride for everyone else.

That was the human world and its hierarchies.

I had never really noticed this kid before. But I was loving to see him again, it was really cool to see what was happening here through him.

“You're Colita right?” He smiled, “I never really got the cance to talk to you”

“Hi” I smiled, “Sorry, I'm kind of busy, I have to sort something out”

“No worries, hope to catch you next time. Are you free any time soon?”

“Where did Jason go with Colessa?” I said. She was vulnerable and needed attention quickly. In her state she couldn't speak. She was selectively mute spontaneously.

“Here's my number' the guy wrote something down on my hand. It was between my thumb and my wrist. Some of the numbers didn't come out so her redrew them on my hand. “Call me next time” he grinned like one of the popular guys.

“Where did Colessa go?”

“Jason took her into the theatre” I headed off straight away but his words held me back like dissonant music. “I wouldn't go in there if I were you. They're having auditions” he said.

“For what?”

“All the drama crew and a lot of the teachers are in there to cast characters for the play”

“What play?”

“Titus Andronicus, you know, the one by Shakespeare? The really brutal one? Seriously? You have no idea do you? I can just say anything right now right?” 

At least he knew how useless he was and I didn't have to tell him.

I walked in the doors from the back of the theatre. The teachers were sitting in the front row, a few students were dressed in costume and sitting behind.

Then Jason walked on with Colessa in his arms. The red liquid was dripping onto the floor as he led her in. She was still in the trance-like state of disbelief and shock and awe.

Jason's voice was as smooth as peanut butter.


“Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
And might not gain so great a happiness
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
Coming and going with thy honey breath.
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.


When he finished, the teachers clapped. “That was great” someone said, “Can we get someone to audition for the role of Titus?”

I ran backstage and onto the stage. 

Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
O, had the monster seen those lily hands
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
Which that sweet tongue hath made,
He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee
O, could our mourning ease thy misery! (2.4.1)

My monologue finished. Everyone stared at me, amazed at what I had just done.

“You look more like Titus than Titus did” One of the smart-looking teachers in the front said. As soon as he spoke the other adults around him nodded in agreement. “That was absolutely beautiful” he was so mesmerized that he asked for my number, and wanted me to cast me, not just for the school production, but for something professional that was happening outside.

“How did you do it?” he said.

I told him how a moment ago I was a girl in the school, but that was all an act, and I was actually someone else. Someone a lot more violent and with strange tendencies.

He nodded like he understood. “Yes, we all want to be someone else a lot of the time. I never wanted to be a teacher. But here I find myself a teacher”

The other teachers around him nodded in agreement.

“When you walk on stage you become someone different, someone you never even knew it was possible for you to be. That's the beauty of the stage. What I saw just now was that metamorphosis. I think when you are walking around the school I never recognize you, because you look like everyone else. Every girl looks the same” He said it as a joke. But it wasn't funny. “But as soon as you step on the stage you become this beautiful thing, this beautiful creature, I'm so touched by it, by you, you have to perform for us.

By us he meant me, and by me, he meant us. I didn't know what he was saying, but he seemed to be overexcited about me. I wasn't some prodigy actress. I was just someone who lived my life.

He wasn't ambiguous, he was just foolish. He wasn't controversial, he was just 

“I was pretending to be a girl just now” I said, “Then I was pretending to be a Roman king.” I said, “Then, now, I am pretending to be a girl who was pretending to be a Roman King”

“I understand” The teacher nodded. “It was a very convincing performance, is what I'm saying. And the way you said it, it made me feel like you meant it, only someone with a lot of life experience can do that”

But I wasn't watching him anymore, I was watching the other teacher's nodding their heads like the bobbing dolls in a car. They just kept nodding to whatever he said. 

Everyone needed their audience.

And everyone needed their stage.

Then I realized that these other teachers had never said a word, they never did anything. When they went home they came back to school to listen to this teacher. When they spoke, they repeated what this teacher said. And when they slept, they slept with their teacher. They were as useless as a performer who was always wearing a mask, behind his head.


I saw Max on the stage, protecting Colessa. Jason was standing backstage, looking at me in admiration. He admired the words that were reflected off me from the teacher. They glowed and fell on the floor. 

Colessa was raped, and then Max was tormented by thoughts of it, he wanted to hold her closely with his life-raft hands to try and reduce the damage. Every few moments he looks around, and when he stops the thoughts keep returning because they are never far behind. Colessa has been dishonored and Max is so unreasonably upset by it, but he abides by the rules of the state. 

I picked up Colessa, she was asleep. It was her way of making the world disintegrate and her brain protecting itself from this lie.

When I carried her back to a bed, no one complained. No one stopped me, and no one told me I was wrong.

### Chapter Forty Five - Max The Critic


Matt recovered more swiftly than Taylor Swift. Next thing I realized besides guns, the boys were bringing big packets of grenades to school.

“This isn't a war zone” Mr. Gilbert said, “Don't bring weapons into school, this is a place of sacred study, this is a place where love and life are touched in their beginning stages, this is a place where respect is learned and admiration is earned. So, in short, this is not a war zone”

They ignored his speech, and Mr. Gilbert, frustrated, ignored them back as well.

We were discussing it after class, Colessa and I. She had recovered from the traumatic experience so fast that it was starting to become a fashion. Colessa was raped in public, yet she is unphased, she is a natural born slut.

When Colessa heard this, she acted like she dind't care. And since she never told me anything, either she didn't trust me either, or she really didn't care what others said about her. She was so strong that other girls even started to want to follow her example and be taken by guys.

“Matt and Jason have grenades in their pockets, at least that's what I think they are”

Colessa agreed with me instantly, like she has also been thinking about it for the last few hours. 

“It's true, they have a little part sticking out.” she said.

But our conversation was overheard by the girl with the biggest ears and biggest mouth in school.


Lacey started laughing, like it was all a big joke. 

To her, it was.

“You girls are desperate for the 'D'” she said, “I've never seen more desperate girls. You see a boy and become like an icecream, frozen until heated.”

That was a weird expression, “No” I said, “I'm not thinking about that, that's not it at all, that's got nothing to do with it. It's dangerous to be in school with them.”


Colessa shook her head, “We don't need it in that state, when it's down it looks all sad, but when it's up, it's like a sergeant like 'yes sir', and that's cool”

“Colessa!” I said. She had totally betrayed me just now. She chose to support Lacey's side.

“Mmm, it's not perverted at all” she said. “No it's not?”

I grunted, if she had supported me just now, then I wouldn't have to be feeling weird right now. She could have said “Yeah, it's violent” or something like that, and then Lacey would look weird.

Weirdness was just meant that you were outvoted.

“See? She's honest” Lacey said, “Colita, you're also desperate for the D” She frowned, “What? It's not like you haven't thought of it before” Lacey looked at me, “I wonder....what kind of adventure lies beneath the deep dark folds of Matt and Jason's pants. What kind of spike is there that I have to dodge to get to the treasure”

“That's totally not appropriate” I said, 

“How about that old guy?” Lacey said, “I bet you've been wondering. Don't start acting all good girly, I'm a good girl, and I don't even act good girly, I just do it shamelessly.”

Was I supposed to be impressed by that? “Thank you Lacey, your words are very helpful.” The only time Lacey and I could get along was when we talked about inappropriate things. Otherwise we were always arguing.

“But what if they were grenades?” Colessa said. “That would be so dangerous for us”

Finally, some sense in the conversation...

“Yeah, then imagine when you're having sex, and you press the wrong thing, BOOM, that's an explosion” 

Colessa and Lacey burst out laughing. “But Lacey” she said, “If they were grenades, then you wouldn't be having sex right? Because it's not the D anymore”

“You can do both, I like men who can do both ways” Lacey looked at Colessa as she said this and Colessa was already laughing before she finished the sentence.

Ahhh so perverted.

“Those boys, they're so afraid and insecure that they need all the power they can have. They carry the grenades with them wherever they go, whatever they do.”

“I bet when they're taking their pants off they're going to forget that they have grenades in their pockets.”

“Or when they're doing you, they need the grenades to feel safe, so they hold them in their hand, like this”

Both girls were hysterical. I looked at them blankly....Oh My Gosh, this was unbearable. I rubbed my head in pain and sorrow.


After lunch, Colessa wasn't in class. She barely got a break before Matt called her out to go to the roof.

Lacey told me it with her matter-of-fact tone of voice.

“What are you talking about?” I said. “Why would he call her up?”

“Because she's an angel” Lacey said.

I hated how she said it like it was something normal. The weight of that word was heavier than something anyone should have to bear.

I heard two gunshots. They rang out like Church bells, except they were shorter and sharper and sounded nothing like Church bells. The only similarity to bells that they had, were the signification of something that had happened.

“I'm sure you know this” Matt was saying, I busted the door open and saw him with a smoking gun, Colessa was lying on the floor like dramatic death.

“I'm dying to your gunshots” she said. There was a hole in her head leaking like a rural water tank, and another hole in her mouth that was sucking in all of the air.

“You look ridiculous” Matt dropped the gun. “Start singing, so that I can dance to something”

Colessa's voice was croaky and hoarse. Just before lunch she had been joking and laughing like any girl was allowed to. Now she was dying. Someone had got the order wrong. Someone had forgotten that Colessa had been raped only recently, someone had forgotten that Colessa was a good girl, and this kind of thing wasn't supposed to happen to good girls.

Matt tried tapping his feet, swinging his hands, and dancing to Colessa's dying rhythm. But all he got was the rhythm of Colessa's death.

“Boring...” he stopped and looked at me. Then looked at the gun on the ground.

“What are you doing?” I said. If anyone else had heard us, they would think I was asking him how to do homework, or asking him how he solved a math problem. 

“You're an angel too right?” Matt said. “Come and heal her” He pointed to the pile of Colessa on the ground. “Clean this up”

I went over to Colessa slowly, Matt didn't reach for the gun. He just smirked. I really didn't know what he was thinking, why he made these abrupt actions. I didn't know what gave him pleasure, or what he was afraid of. I didn't know what he wanted. And that was what made him scary.

I pulled out my necklace and it glowed in anticipation of human contact.
 
But it wasn't Matt that stopped me. Colessa was still alive. “Hurry” she said, “Heal me”

“Wait a second, and you'll return to normal” I said, “Then we can laugh and joke around” She was in a bad condition, the hole in her mouth was uscking in all the air and it was blowing out of the hole in her head. Like a pool table that was constantly circulating for someone else's pleasure.

“Hurry, quickly” she said, “Heal me, quickly”

Then when I raised my necklace to try and heal her, Colessa's hand gripped me and held me still. “No, she said, don't”

I didn't understand...”I thought you wanted me to heal you. I have to do it now, you're in a bad state.”


Colessa looked past me, beyond my presence, beyond Matt's presence, and onto something that was far more important. She shook her head in fear and misfortune.

“Why now, why does he have to appear now?” Her hand held me still, not wanting me to go any further. “Don't heal me” she said. Now her voice was a teeter. She wouldn't survive much longer. She wouldn't survive another sentence.

I looked back to the intruder. The man watching us from the doorway was Max. He stood big and tall, watching Colessa with pain in his eyes.

“I can heal her!” I shouted. “I need your help”

Max stared at me, then he stared at me some more and shook his head. “You can't” he said. 

“Is this because it's against the rules?” I said, “Colessa wants to be healed”

“No, she respects the rules” Max said, “It's what is most important”

“Just now...” I decided not to say it, that before Max arrived Colessa wanted to be healed, in Max's eyes Colessa was a pure soul, untainted and special. She didn't want Max to know...She would rather die than survive and lose what little honor she had left.

I couldn't tell him that she had changed her mind as soon as she saw him watching. It wasn't my place to, it wasn't right. She wanted him to believe that she was someone who could be trusted to the very end. That was her most sacred promise that she protected with her life. And now it couldn't be tainted anymore.

Max said the rest, he told me what he believed, and what Colessa wanted him to believe. “She is an amazing person; because last time she broke rules there was a lot of trouble, she ended up causing great misery. So now, she chose to follow the rules, she knows her own life doesn't mean anything in the big scheme of things. “

Max looked at Matt now, he sighed. “I only hope that you can see this and be convinced that angels are human too, we love, hate, and support and destroy each other the same way you humans do. There is nothing different about us. We can live together in harmony. Are you convinced of it young man?”

Matt was aloof, he was a completely quiet person now. But not because he was touched, it was because he was amazed.
What shocked me wasn't Matt, it was Max. He started talking about what I learnt was Colessa. Not as a person, but as an object that he revered.

“Isn't it beautiful?” he said, “Something that was moving just a moment before is now incapable of moving, incapable of making a sound. It's the same as everything that we find on the street. The cleaners come by and sweep it to the side of the road and move on.”

“What are you talking about?” I said, “Are you talking about Colessa?”

“Today” he said, “I learnt the lesson of beauty, the ultimate beauty is the saddest thing, and it's the most real thing, it's so simple that you don't have to say anything and anyone will understand”

“I can still heal her” I said.

“No, you don't have to, what's happened has happened”

He acted like he didn't care. I thought he loved Colessa? He was crying helplessly when she was raped, but now she was dead and he didn't shed a tear. What was wrong with him? Had he just been pretending this whole time?

“If we covered those holes, and stuffed the mouth, then she would look like a real live person” Max said, “Isn't that amazing?”

Maybe it was because he had so much sorrow that it couldn't surface without destroying him, maybe he couldn't conceal it anymore because it would burn him from the inside out, into deep gashed ashes. 

That was the only explanation I could come up with. That was the only thing I could tell myself, even if it was a weak argument.

Colessa was dead, and Max was analyzing it like a work of art? He was supposed to be a leader among us angels, he made me feel ashamed of my race.

He didn't stop, he was inspired, “Learn this” he said, “Learn about how violence works” He was at his most insightful, “This is what happens in the end, this body has become so different.” He said that this person ruined by violence has nothing to lose anymore, they can rest. His voice sounded like a small old twig that was barely hanging on to the tree trunk. “In the end, the most beautiful thing is this worthless and twisted body. Like a Bonsai tree that grows in the strangest and most uncomfortable ways.”

He walked up to her, completing the ritual of angel departure, his hands tucked around her neck and unwrapped (Because everyone is wrapped up) the necklace. It came loose as a flower losing it's petals. 

His voice was touchy, as if he was talking to a gentle teddy bear. “If your lover had seen your necklace, he surely would leave it on you, because no place is more befitting for the necklace than around the stem of a young girl. And now look what you have become.” 

Colessa's ears didn't hear, her eyes didn't see, and her mouth would never respond to what he was saying to her.

And only then did Colessa stop being Colessa.

She was nameless.

### Chapter Forty Six - Lacey the Noble.

Max came over to me, Matt stood behind him, still sitting silently. 

Max's expression was kind. Like he hadn't been insulting Colessa just now, like everything was under control.

“There are things more rare than an angel being born to the world” He said. “One of those things is to appreciate the other rarest thing, which is an angel's death to the world.” He put his arms around me, I thought he was hugging me and wrapped my arms around him as well. A hug from him was long overdue.

“I love you Colita” I felt his warmth on my nose, I felt his hands moving and my collar loosening.

“Why are you taking my necklace too?” Of course he didn't care about me. I was stupid for thinking it. He saw me just as someone he could use for his missions, nothing else.

He took my necklace in the midst of everything. “I respect you and that's why I'm doing this. Remember, it's not because I hate you and think you're worthless now, it's because I'm a man of my word. Without my word I'm not even a man.” 

It was because I had tried to save Colessa, that's why he was doing this. Because I remorselessly broke the rules. If Max had never seen it, then everything would be fine and Colessa would be alive. But if Max saw it, then it changed everything. He judged us based on what he saw, not what he heard. Because he had heard about me before. 

“I'm sorry” he said, “I can't see that and not do anything, it's my responsibility as an angel as well. It's hard when our duties collide, but they do, and this is what I have to do now. I have to protect our cause. And because Colessa died for this cause, if I don't do this, then I am also disrespecting Colessa”

I didn't tell him that I thought what he had been saying about her was the ultimate disrespect. Because in the end he wouldn't listen, men never listened. They only heard things when they were convenient.

“But don't you see Matt has a gun?” Matt had picked up the weapon once again and held it towards us. “You're stripping yourself of your only protection. Us angels are here to protect you as well”

“There are things more important than guns and death.” Max said. He had hardly finished before he was shot. He fell to the ground, stunned.

“Can I heal you now?” I said.

“I'm alright” he said, “It's just a shot to the leg” 

His leg was leaking, but he held it still, clenching his muscles like sculpture wires. 

Matt laughed and dropped the gun and walked off to go to the playground.

I later went to visit Max in the nursery again. After his arrival, he had spent more time hurt and recovering than doing any work.

“I will do anything for our cause” he said, “It's more important to me than my life. My life is not important to me” He smiled to me in his nobility. I guess he wanted me to admire and respect him.

I had weaned a kid for him, yet I still didn't feel anything for his ideals. They were two separate things.

“Can I at least keep my name?” I said. “I lost my necklace, but can I keep my name?”

I never took your name” he said, “That's yours to keep”

“So I'm a fallen angel?” I said. “Is that what I am now?”

He didn't answer and pretended to be asleep. When I went back to class Matt was nowhere to be seen and Lacey was making a fuss. She was telling her new girlfriends about the wrinkle that she was trying to remove. It had appeared on her face twenty years too early, she had tried in vain not to see it for a whole week. She said it appeared suddenly and without warning, like a disaster, or like a heart attack. And from then on her life had changed and she had to keep convincing herself that she was okay in order to keep going.

“Lacey” I said, “Earlier today you were fine”

“I know, I was trying so hard not to tell you anything” she said, “I wouldn't want to worry you, I would rather die than make anyone else suffer for me”

“That's so noble of you” I said. “You're so kind, to be able to hold that back from your friends. You are a great friend.”

“Thank you” she said, “By the way, where's Colessa? I heard she went to the roof with Matt”

### Chapter Forty Seven - Max the Artist (because critics develop into artists)

_So from here I think we're going to start seeing short and snappy chapters about more general things that relate to the story less, and more to the world. The pace is going to increase and we'll see all sorts of different people. Also, the highly anticipated*(!!!!!) final climax is going to appear, so don't leave us yet. We'll be back shortly right after the commercials!!!!_

_Still there?_

_Good :)_

Over the next few days nothing really happened at school. People came and went like a bowling ball down the aisle. I refused to meet with Max. Now that I think about it I was probably upset at Max for taking away my necklace. And I was sad that Colessa was gone. It took me a while to gather my thoughts and understand them. Most people told me that I was just over thinking. 


When I finally went in to see Matt he was reading a magazine.

“What are you doing with Woman's Weekly?” I said.

He looked up at me with a grimace curling his features into a Dali painting. “What do you mean?” It took him a while to find out that I was talking about his magazine. He flipped the cover over and grunted.

“No wonder it was so stupid” He threw it down and stretched out his already stretched legs. He looked up at me, his head was like a small curve that stuck out from the covers. Seeing him reminded me of my pets. “So what brings you here?” he said.

“Do you still think about Colessa?” I said, “Wasn't she amazing?”


He disregarded my question with a delay, “Did you know that Dali always had something in his paintings that made them sink?”

“They sink?” How was this related?

“You know, like the Titanic?”

It was clear this had nothing to do with me, I don't know why I even bothered to try and take him seriously. I wasn't in his mind, he was in his own world. I was the only one caught up still thinking about him, hoping that maybe this time our relationship would reignite, that maybe this time he would understand. 


“In all of his paintings, I think he's ingenious, he has big clocks sinking into a puddle of time. Huge sceneries bare of anything will come back to haunt me at night”

“I never knew you were such an artistic sense” I said.  

“You didn't know?” His eyebrows rose like a plane taking off. “It's something I've always wanted to do”

“Always wanted to do? We were together for five years and I you never mentioned it.”

“Colessa always encouraged me, after I retired...”

“Oh, so Colessa knew?”

“I told her everything about it” He was beaming, “Isn't it amazing? Dali had huge things sinking into nothing. Everything was weighed down and malleable to the assaults of time and passion, and consciousness.”


“Yes” I said. I had never seen this side of Max before, but to think that she had been familiar with it made me clench my teeth. I didn't ask for much, I wasn't always bugging him, I gave him his space. I was even doing this ten month long mission for him, I tried to be as considerate as I could without annoying him. But he still didn't see me. I was just a microphone that he shouted into so that his own thoughts could be projected.

“I'm going to make a big painting like these humans did, especially Dali, I love Dali, do you know why?” His speaking allowed me to relax on my choking voice. I didn't have to talk and he would go on, I didn't have to say anything to betray how I was feeling so unimportant. “Dali was probably a human who was supposed to be an angel, he never really fit in, he always changed things. I can really relate to that.”

“But weren't you the one who said humans and angels aren't different?”

“That's just company policy” Max said, “Actually we're very different”

Oh, so now we were conveniently different. A moment later we would be conveniently placed in the same box again. His hypocrisy was impressive, he said whatever he wanted to everyone else and did whatever he wanted for himself.

But even when he acted so immature, I couldn't help loving him.


I had to ask him, “Do you still think about Colessa?” I said, “Wasn't she amazing?” 

“To me” Max said, “She's still alive right here” he patted his chest and wiped a tear that had formed on the horizon of his left eye. 

“I never know what result will come from an action” I said. “Whether my intention is good or not seems not to matter to the ways of the world”

Max had one eye open and focused on me, the other was closed and dreaming. “Is that why you came to talk to me?” he said, “Because you're having some grand moralistic dilemma?”

“No” I said, “It's just a girl's problems”

“No” he said, “It's a human's problems, they always wonder about how to live their life, what to do is good and what is wrong, how to treat others and how to be treated, it's stupid, a huge waste of time.”

“A waste of time?” I said

“You've been around these humans too long” he said. “You're thinking has become warped by them”

“It's not their thinking” I said, “It's what I think”

“Even that's part of it” he said, “You're so warped that you don't even know that you've become warped. Do you want to sit and and talk about the angel rules? That might help you.”

“No” I said, “What I thought, what I always thought, whether human or angel or not, is that the world should be organized and everyone is supposed to care for each other. That's how I was raised, and how I learned in the world”


“Yes, and we are all doing that” Max said, “What do you want? You're already doing that aren't you?”

“Yes” I said. Max was right, the truth was that I didn't know what I wanted. Sometimes I did what I thought was the right thing and someone complained because it was such a bad thing. But to complicate it, sometimes I did a wrong thing, knowing it was a wrong thing, and then it was welcomed and even praised by other people. No matter my actions and my intentions, the consequences seemed to have almost no relation.

What I saw in Max was someone who had their actions laid out in front of them. When Max wanted for something to happen, it did. He changed his life with his own decisions. I guess I admired that. And recently I was really afraid, because whatever I did, it seemed to have no relation to my life. Or it wouldn't change anything. My life was in one place and the world was in another, there was hardly a tie between them. They were two separate processes with no communication between each other.

“How about Colessa?” Max said, “Do you think she would have worried about this?”

“No” I said, “Because Colessa was strong enough to to live her life”

“That's what I've always admired in you” Max's eyes narrowed, as if he were looking into the sun. “You have this quality, this talent, this personality, that you always see things beyond yourself. I find that very rare, and it's actually what made me attracted to you in the first place.”

I bit my lip, this was the most affection I had ever seen from Matt. He was always the tough one who never saw anyone beyond his own life. He made everyone revolve around him. I never expected him to respect me for anything.

“How many people see things beyond themselves?” Max said, “Some people are 'aware' some people are not. Some people 'exist' while other's 'thrive'. We all have different labels for the same people. But the fact is, I've never really met anyone who thinks so little about them self as you do Colita” 

Was he trying to be kind? Or was he trying to insult me? How was I supposed to take this? With a smile?

“Don't you think that in the end Colessa was very noble? Although you and her probably had your troubles with each other, Colessa was able to stay true to herself in the end. If that isn't one of the greatest achievements of man, then what is?”

If Colessa were here now, and Max didn't see her, she would be tryign to cheat the system again, I was sure of it. But Max didn't know that, that's why he could speak so morally of her.

In some ways she was right. Max respected her more than ever. She had left her greatest deed to the end, and done it with so much viguor that it couldn't possibly go without creating a mark in the world.

“Now there's only us two left” Max said, “now let's hypothesize a situation. Visualize it to your best okay?”

I nodded, sure.

“This hasn't happened here” he said, “But it's happened with another angel of mine, and I don't want you to judge her actions when I tell you what she did, I just want you to understand that this is also a possibility, and she really did these things, okay?”

I nodded.

“So, where should I start. Right, in this mission I was shot, it was a fatal attack, I was targeted by a human resistance group who hated angels. It was completely unexpected so I couldn't protect myself. But that's not all, there was an undercover angel, much like yourself right now, she was on a mission here and saw what had happened. She immediately touched her chest to feel the necklace. But she just wanted to make sure it was there, seeing me getting injured reminded her that she was an angel, but she didn't want to do anything not in front of all of these people watching.”

“That's horrible” I said.

“Don't judge her actions” Max said, “I just want you to get familiar with this situation. It's perhaps the hardest part of being an angel, to have so much power and not be allowed to use it, or something is holding you back from saving a loved one. It's a tough decision to make, but unfortunately we are the ones who have to make it. No one else can do it for us. So, getting back to the story, this girl wasn't just a bit afraid that she might be caught and everyone found out she was an angel. She wasn't at a high school, she was at a presidential election. Imagine it, what if it was you, you are dying, and your friend won't heal you, because she knows she isn't allowed to, because the mission is more important than you life. If everyone had found out that she was an angel, then her life and career would be over right then and there.”


It was sooo bad for her.

“But this high school is easy compared to what she had to face” he said, “At the last moment she was overcome by the guilt and ran in to save me. But she stood above me, cradling my head, and holding me closely. Her hands were trembling, I felt them through her woolen gloves,”Her eyes stared at me in fear and looked apologetic, she wanted to make it up to me somehow. But she knew that if she were a human, then nothing would happen. But because she was an angel, they would do everything and anything to eliminate her.” 

“Why are you telling me this?” I said.

“Because it's the hardest thing an angel has to face” Max said, “Us angels are fine in our world, we live normally, but when you are exposed to the human world for a long time, you start to see things differently, every year I get new angels who are unprepared for the job complaining about not fitting in, or being unable to associate with humans properly, unable to make friends. Because of all the hardship in our lives, all of the strife and weathering that we go through, these small things are in a way perhaps the hardest of all”

Jason knew Colessa was the other one. He must have known. And as soon as they found out, then she was gone.

Max was telling me this to impress me, “But if you don't feel anxiety, then you don't feel anything at all” I said. “You were the one who knows this the most right?”

“Why are you so negative towards me” he said. “you act like you're close, but you criticize everything I say”

I hadn't expected this.

“You always start saying things that want to disagree with me, like you are just dissatisfied with me as a person. Even on the phone you talk like I belong to you or something, like I'm supposed to answer your every whim. I'm your boss okay? Don't treat me like your friend, or your ex-boyfriend, because that's finished now.”

“Okay” I said. I never realized he thought I had a negative attitude towards him,  never knew he felt that way about me, like my calling him so casually was annoying. I thought he had always enjoyed the attention as well.

I really didn't know him anymore. I had none of those intentions, my intentions were good. I really wanted to be liked by him, and I thought the best of his impulsive and sometimes heartless ways. I looked over his weaknesses and tried to support him. 

But why did he dislike me so?


We stood there facing each other, my body was facing out the window, confronting him, but not really wanting to. Max was staring at me, his eyes said no different. But it was clear to me that our relationship was over. Whatever little that had been left over between us was now gone.

### Chapter Forty Six

```
_So umm, guys it seems like Colita has finally realized where she stands in Max's heart. Which is nowhere. She was the doormat welcoming him home, but once he dusted his shoes off she never saw him again until he reappeared. She was only there for his changes, but never in his most important moments._

_It was a sad realization for her, so she is probably going to change from here. (Go girl, you got this!!!)_

_And a lot of others are going to come in. Matt and Jason haven't been doing much beyond pointing guns, but now let's take a look at what Nathan has in store for us :) He can be a nice guy when he wants to._

_So...after turning her lovely gaze away from Max, Colita begins to see other fish in the sea. And some of them are actually pretty well-rounded...if you know what I mean ????:)???_


__Okay, here we go...__

Jazz it uuuuupppppp
```



When I walked along the corridor it wasn't without regret. I thought each step behind me was obvious, that people all saw me and my foosteps and where I was going and were averting away from me in all directions. Like a shark was swimming through the ocean.

No one liked sharks in the ocean. 

No one wanted to be with someone like me.

All, except for one person.

“Hey Colita” I turned and saw Nathan, he had his hand raised awkwardly, then noticed that I saw it and dropped it equally awkardly. “So....I was wondering what you've....been....up to lately.” 

He completed his sentence finally, I guess his nervousness was supposed to be conspicuous. But it wasn't to me, I was too drowned in myself to see his distress and courage at approaching me. Usually it would be Julia or Colessa to tell me...but...

I laughed at the dark humor. They weren't even alive!

“Colita?” he looked away, “Sorry, am I boring you? You seem a bit distant.”

I think I finally saw him then. He wasn't another student, he wasn't concerned about me being an angel or a human, he was a boy talking to me for who I was. And I was a woman.

“No” I said, “I was just confused.” I tried to open up my gaze to let him know I was interested. He was a cool person.

“Confused?” he laughed. Then caught my stare, “No, sorry, I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing at the way you said it, it sounded like something you would say”

“Something I would say?” At this point I was just pretty much repeating after him.

“The way you say things, it's really cute, ahh, anyway, do you want to talk about something?”

Who knew if this was a date or not? But I did need to talk, and he was kind. 


I told him something that had been on my mind and he was very hospitable. He welcomed my ideas with an open ear.

“That's the trouble” he said, “Men and women want different things in their lives. Men want to spread their seeds, like a hose on a summer day making a rainbow on the stony concrete driveway on a semi-steep slope to the garage. Women want to protect and nurture their seeds in good soil that is fit for roses to grow in.”

“How do you know all this?”

“Oh, I don't know much” he looked embarrassed and rubbed the back of his head, “I just read all sorts of stuff online.”

“Oh really, about what?” He sounded so much mature than these small fries running around school pronouncing themselves as true men and dressing in belts and suits andskinny jeans. Nathan was dressed without any fashion sense, his hair looked like an unhappy weed growing in the sea, but what he was saying was so much more amazing than anything I had heard from a high school kid. His parents must be proud.

“Just relationship stuff you know, people things”

I didn't take Nathan to be such serious reader, I was impressed to see this side of him  that I had never known. I think also liked to read relationship stuff. I liked to read whatever Nathan liked to read.

"But you can't seriously believe that right? I'm a person too" I negged him, “That makes me sound like my life purpose is just to nurture babies and I can't live a real life.”

“I'm just repeating what I heard from others” he raised his hands in denial. “For me as well, I sort of have the same problem so don't blame me.”

“Really?' I said. I forgot what I had told him, but I was eager to hear what he had to say about whatever it was we were talking about. “Mm, hmm, go on” I just wanted to watch him speak. I would agree with anything he had to say.
 
“Well, I have a sister right?” he said.

“Well I don't know, you tell me, do you?”

“I have a sister” he said. “Right?”

“Do you?”

“I have a sister” he said.

“Okay, so we've established that, now can we move on?”

“Why didn't you understand that?” he was confused.

“I didn't understand that? I did right?”

“Why, didn't you understand that?”

“Which is it, why didn't you understand that? Or 'Why, didn't you understand that?”

“Both”

“Haha, that's funny” he didn't laugh so I asked him a different question that had appeared to me like a tiny shooting star in the night sky that attracted all the attention. “What are you going to do after you graduate?”

He looked at me, I'm going to do a lot” he said.

“Such as?” I leaned over, “I'm all ears”

“Well, it goes back to my sister”

“Is this serious, you just want to talk about your sister right?”


“No, it answers your question, so, if you're going to let me continue, my sister says that I'm perverted, not just in general, but to her. See? It's kind of similar to what you were telling me”

“What did you do?” I said. “You didn't touch her did you? Because that would be disgusting.”

“I didn't do that....if it would be disgusting”

“You'd better not”

“No, of course not, although we were both adopted, so it's not like we're blood related.”

“Nathan! Don't ever say that, your parents love you equally, and I'm sure your real parents do as well.” 

“Well, my sister was disappointed in me, that's what I thought.”

“What did she say? I'm a girl so I might be able to tell” I was supposed to be talking, but the shell had turned to Nathan's possession. It was surprisingly relieving to hear about him though, so I didn't mind.

“She said she sees how I look at things in a way, and that I should at least hide it better.” 

“What do you mean?” I said. “You look at things...how”

“She means in a perverted way”

“Bah” I waved it off, “Pah, you're a guy right?” I decided not to mention that I was actually really perverted with everyone else, except for Nathan. I knew he had open ears, but he would still judge me on it. And he would also feel left out...maybe. If I was worth being felt left out for.

“I never knew you had a sister” I said.

“I do, you never knew did you?”

“No, I didn't.” It seemed kind of random, he had never mentioned her before, and now suddenly she appeared out of nowhere, she was presumably someone always involved in his life and seen the many facets of his character.

Nathan seemed proud to have something of his that I didn't know about, and for a man, pride was important.

“How old is she?”

“I'm not telling you” he said.

“Where does she go to school? Is she hot?”

He smiled, “I'm not telling you anything”

I decided to let him keep her and his pride.

“You know, I was talking to my Mom” he said.

“Your Mom? How is this related to what you were saying just now?” Did he have some profound reasoning for raising his family members one by one? Or was this just the randomness of Nathan, alive?

“After I talked to her I felt much better”

The keyword here was 'much'. I never knew that Nathan even suffered, to me he was always the excited guy who was hitting on me. I never pictured him to feel anything less than 'better'.

He spoke fondly, “She said that she read a book that gave her ideas that maybe I had a lot of pent up hurtness, or upset. She said it was better for me to understand my emotions than continually swimming around in them without any way of identifying where they come from and where they go.”

“She sounds poetic” I said, “Not many Mom's are poetic, I mean we're all poets, but that's before and after being Mom's.”

He gave me a strange expression with his eyebrows fluctuating like a belly dancer's belly.

“Go on” I said, “I'm listening” I think he was just happy to have someone he could tell this to, someone besides his Mom and his sister, and whoever else was in his family proximity.

“By talking to you like this” he said, “By talking to others, I see myself in a new way, I always thought I was special and unique and everyone else is the same and I'm different from them.”

“Hmm”

“But when I speak like this, I feel like I'm exactly the same, and like you've had this conversation before with thousands of other people who all think that they're completely unique and completely different. But my speaking like this doesn't impress you, because it's the same as everyone else's.”

“Hmm”

“Well, what I think I'm saying is that I always make friends with other people who are hurt as well, or with people who are left out, because they are weak, or because they are gentle. But also because they don't bite back. That's why I befriend them, especially whenever I feel hurt by someone else. I'm just another person passing this pent up hurtness down the chain. We're all wounded, so we look for someone else to lick our wounds for us and bandage them.”

“Hmm, okay”

“You don't understand do you?” he said, “You're just agreeing to everything”


“Yeah”

“I like kids as well, not in a weird way, but because it's another interaction without the risk of being attacked or offended etc. This pent up feeling just naturally leads to more. So much so that it is always leaking and being released in small amounts like toxic radiation.”

I nodded, this was very important to him, he probably felt like I didn't know what he meant. It was an insult to him for me to just nod and agree. I had to say something, “You're not trying to hurt anyone, but before you know it there's a string of dissatisfied people behind you, am I right?”

Nathan looked at me like a goldfish, it reminded me of my pet back home. I wondered what it would be like if I took Nathan back and stuck him in the fishtank as well, not in a weird way, in a good way that would be totally normal and acceptable.

He seemed to know what I was thinking, and blinked. That killed the mood, because goldfish didn't blink, they just stared and gaped.

“That was beautiful” he said, “I'm going to write that down, what was it?”

“You're not trying to hurt anyone, but in one person's happiness is another person's grief, it's a natural push and pull of the world.”

“Oh my gosh, Colita, you're like amazing, what are you doing in school, you should become a philosopher or something”

“Thank you” I grinned, that was the first time I heard that compliment...Although I didn't want to be stuck in a room with my thoughts for the rest of my life. “So Nathan, how does this at all relate to what you were saying about what you want to do?”

“I'm not too sure” he said, “I've thought about it, and I want to help people in the world, all this cycle of balance of stuff going around, like pain and hurt, and selfishness, I want to get rid of it and help people live the best lives they can. Do you know how I can do that?”

Nathan had depths to him, I never knew that he had thought about so much, about his family and about how he could help people in the world. He usually just palyed football and flirted, but his mind worked in these ways too. Not only was he good to look at, he was also mentally stimulating and emotionally knowledgeable.

If he spoke any more, I might actually fall for him.

“I'm not sure” I said, “But Nathan, you're a great guy, you're such an honest and good guy, watching out for other people, and so caring as well, I'm sure you'll find your way and make this world a better place.”

“That's what everyone wants to do though” Nathan said, “I don't think anyone's bad, they just want to make this world a better place, but it's like you said, you end up hurting someone on the way and being blessed by someone else.”


“You're amazing” I said, “I wish you were a bit older”

“I'm nothing” he said, “I'm a small person a lot of the time, it's just when I talk about stuff like this that I talk bigger than I am. Most of the time I'm just thinking bad things about everyone around me and getting annoyed over small things.

“That's human” I said.

Suddenly he fell silent, and I knew I had stumbled. It was almost taboo to talk about it now. It was an impenetrable impasse between us. At least that's how I felt.

“I'm jealous of you” Nathan said.

“What?” I sounded like a piano that you played on full, with the pedal down so you could barely hear it.

“You're always with guys, you're always laughing, and everyone around you is laughing, I'm jealous of that”

I knew he was serious, because he couldn't go from talking about his ideals to thisso quickly without being so. (in jest)

“I never go around with other girls” he said, “And you probably won't be jealous of me if I do anyway, but I want you to notice me. When you don't, I feel weak and worthless, like nothing is alright, everything is hazy and blurry.”


“Don't think that” I said. “it's not healthy”

“It's more than that” he said, “I just really want to have friends like that, I can joke about things, and we really care about each other, and we can do everything together.”

“That sounds like...you're not jealous of me Nathan, you're jealous of just girls in general?”

He looked at me helplessly. Like everything I was saying reached into him and shook his insides loose, it took him a while to piece himself together.


“Well I'm glad to have this chat with you Nathan, and I don't want to talk to you again”

“Really?” he said.


“Nah, jokes, of course I love you.”

“I'm always amazed by how angels see the world, they see it with childlike wonder, they see humans as being better than they actually are. That's what I feel anyway”

“Really?” I said.

“Being a human isn't that great” he said, “Human's are not kind, I can tell you this because I am one”

The reason I was creeped out was because Nathan just kept going, he didn't know when to stop, it seemed like he had so much to say, and it was tiring to listen to. At first I was impressed, but then it went on like breaks that had worn loose and thin. I didn't know how to respond.

But also because the angels he talked about who had a childlike wonder, not angles were like that. It was actually me just me who was like that.

### Chapter Forty Seven - Colita the Storyteller.

So we got to get to know Nathan a little better, now we see Clita's reactions to Nathan's forwardness. Is she a little afraid of his deep deep thoughts? Or is she shy of how others see them? Is a relationship betweent he two possible? Let's ignore their shallow differences for a second, but how about Nathan being a human and Colita being an angel? Is it still possible for a romance to blossom between the two? Or is it as Max says, and the gap is just too big to be crossed?

Nathan doesn't see the gap. He's a dreamer.

Anyway, now we see Colita telling a story, and we see something in her that we didn't see earlier (hopefully) 

As always, thanks for reading, you guys are my sweeties!!!!:)



Nathan stuck around me more often, after he told me those things he felt closer to me. The problem was that I was starting to find him to be too much. Wherever I looked, he was always there. He reminded me of Julia.

A Julia without slit marks on her wrist.

One math class, Mr. Gilbert left the room and gave us 'revision time', which was code for, 'do whatever you want and I won't check it later'

Which was also code to Nathan for, 'Go-and-talk-to-Colita-for-the-rest-of-the-lesson-because-oh-no,-she's-not-busy-at-all'

The other students looked when Nathan approached me, Matt was asleep so he didn't, and Jason was flirting with Lacey. But they noticed that Nathan always sat next to me and talked to me quietly and laughed quietly.

If anyone saw it, they would think Romance with a capital 'R'. So I decided to tell Nathan a story that would probably make him back off.

“Do you want to hear something that Julia told me, it's what she learned in sociology class”

Nathan frowned, I knew he saw Julia as the sad girl who committed suicide. Most people did. That was half the reaosn I wanted to tell this story, to show them that Julia was and is more than that.

“Okay” he said, “But is it important?”

“That's for you to judge” I said.

We started the story in the classroom, I pretended to focus on math problems while my mind was full of memories of Julia. I accessed whichever ones I was fond of and told him them. Nathan leaned in to listen, like a lover.

“One day it was just during morning tea, and Julia came and told me about her sociology class she had just been in, she said how the teacher, Mrs. Jenkins talked about hurt people and wounded people. Whenever someone is hurt or wounded at all, a dissonance is created, this is stress. Stress is something that needs to be exuded and gotten rid of somehow”

“Is this what Julia said?”

“Well, it's what Mrs. Jenkin's said, she was just repeating it to me”

“It's really fascinating” he said.

“So, people will get rid of their stress in different ways, one way is through violence or sex. I rejected this to Julia outright, because it sounded too much like me, and I didn't want to believe that I was such a lowly and weak person. I didn't want to hear her talk about it again. But then she laughed at me and said that all of the things I thought about, and the things on my mind, she had already thought of them last year.”

“She was repeating her ideas, sometimes she said similar thigns, and it made me realize that this was the way Julia thought, so that made me feel better, but it also made me feel worse. She said I was gaining tempo, that I was learning more and more and faster, so I had improved.”

“That's not a nice thing to say” he said, “That's like saying a fat person is slowly getting skinnier and better looking, almost as good looking as me”

I shrugged, “Most of the time it's alright to say, it's harmless, but you should be careful not to say it to someone who has (holds) pride in their ideas” 

“I never really spoke to Julia” Nathan said, “I just saw her with you but never spoke to her. I never knew she thought about stuff much. She sounds like someone really interesting”

“Well you've missed your chance” I said. “She was someone with a shell so thick that you can only see shell. But a big shell is there to hide something big and precious inside. An important present is wrapped up carefully. A fragile present requires a lot of packaging to keep it safe. There's a lot of things we both could have learned from Julia, we could still belearning from her.”

The guilt resurfaced, it came up for a fresh breath of air, what I had submerged down for so long always managed to come back.

“The way you say it, we're all presents” Nathan said “Presents to offer to who?”

“I don't know” I said, “But depending on who you offer it to, your present changes doesn't it?”

I wasn't trying to talk about that, but with Nathan stories flowed smoothly, and philosophies crept in like shadows on a sunny day.


“Julia used to always say things with honestry, she would always try to say something as honestly as possible instead of trying to persuade others. It was something she could do because she was so sure of herself. Because when you try to persuade someone, maybe it's because you're not sure of it yourself? But that's also why she was so weak, because everything was taken as a direct hit to her, and not to another thing she was pretending to be.”

As I spoke, Nathan listened carefully. I knew he was following each word, and I knew he would remember every sentence for a long time. He was such a good dude, it was rare to find someone as real as him.

The bell rang and class ended. I put away my work that was never going to be checked, Nathan closed his blank page and put it away in his bag. Then we headed down the corridor, still talking about stuff,

“You know, before Colessa died, she had the chance to survive” I said.

“Really? Why didn't you save her?” he looked around, afraid he had spoken too loud about my supernatural abilities.


“She died because of her strict relying on rules and following rules so precisely.”

“That's something to be respected” he said, “Loyalty is so rare these days”

“Is it?” I said, “I don't know where an Angel's morals come from, or where they go, but Colessa's came from being seen. Whenever she wasn't seen, her morals also disappeared.”

“Is that a bad thing though?” Nathan said, “Who are we to judge where morals should come from, everyone is different right?”

“But the whole point of morals is for them to be the same” I said. “Colessa didn't heal the one she loved, and she didn't heal herself even, just because it was against the rules. But what's unlucky is that when she did follow the rules, then something bad happened, and when she didn't follow them, then everything seemed to go smoothly. I think that's why she just started acting in front of others. She only followed rules because she knew Max was watching. In the end, angels are not any different to humans.”

We were in line in the cafeteria, waiting to get the morning tea. It was a yellow squishy cake with a little bit of sugar. No one knew what it was, but it was available, and last time we ate it, everybody seemed fine, so now we were in line for it again.

“You may not know it” I pushed against the people behind em who kept squishing us forward. “After Colessa died I was so sad, Colessa was the first person I ever truly loved. Colessa had the biggest heart for the world, and only did things that were right for everyone. She found the best in everyone.” 

“Really?” Nathan took a step forward in the queue, and the girls behind us immediately pushed us forward, they were jabbering loudly about something that happened in class just now.

“But that's what I say about everyone” I said, “I am a really shallow person, I say everyone is the best for me, I call everyone my best friend, and I'm close to one person one moment, then ignore them the next.”

“You do?” Nathan said.

“I'm a bit of an attention whore”

The word 'whore' made the girls behind em stand still, like the taboo word had been spoken. As soon as I smiled back to them, they gradually eased up and resumed talking about their class and how it made them so annoyed.

Nathan grabbed my wrist, he looked over the queue, all around us, he was tall. Everyone noticed him as he pulled me out of the queue and led me outside to a more quiet place.

“I want you to listen to this song” he pulled out his MP3, then gave me one ear, he took the other, and we were curled up on the bleachers in the empty gym, listening to a fast song.

Pretty Girl Rock: Kerry Hilson
Gee: Girl's Generation

The first song was a self obsessed woman. The second was a weird asian language that Nathan was mouthing the words to. But he looked kind of cute when he did so. 

I later went home and downloaded the songs as well.

At lunch I saw Nathan and the story continued as we went to lunch, down the corridor, then after lunch, outside on the football field, we were talking amidst boys kicking balls around us and yelling and screaming and laughing and complaining in exictement.


Nathan really wanted to hear me speak, and I was really glad to have someone to talk to. It was't really romance, but what was really romance?

“Colessa once told me that Julia confessed to her.”

“What, you mean as in she loved her?”

I nodded, “Julia ws open to ltierally anything, she told Colessa she liked her”

“How do you know this, is it just from what Colessa said?”

“Yes” I said, “But Colessa was a woman of her words, she would never lie, she died for words, so she lived for them as well.”

“Okay” he said.

“And so, when Julia was lying there dead, and I could have revived her, that was also cycling through my mind” 

“You mean because Julia liked Colessa more than she liked you, you felt left out, or...”


“Jealous” I said, that word seemed to be the biggest and baddest word in the world. “I'm so bad aren't I? Like this it's almost like I killed her. I chose not to save her because I knew she didn't like me as much as she liked Colessa.  I thought about this, and think that's why she was also asking me to save her, and not Colessa, partly because she kenw Colessa wouldn't break the rules, but also because she didn't mind humiliating herself in front of me, but not in front of Colessa. There was something about Colessa that she liked more than me. She had something I didn't.”

Nathan kicked a ball that came our way away, then wanted me to go on.

“I told Julia everything, I mean everything, about myself, she knew all of my secrets, the nice ones, and the not so nice ones. I always knew that she liked Colessa but I didn't want to believe just how much more, I never said it, to save my own emotions.” This alst part was hard to say, “And when the situation was presented to me, I chose not to save Julia.”

It must have been bad for Nathan to hear that,

“You saved her so many times” Nathan said, “I don't think you're bad, and you're just trying to justify her death by blaming yourself, it's not fair for all the responsibility to be on your shoulders, Colessa probably wouldn't be abel to handle it.”

“I know” I had thought about it all before, I just wanted him to listen. That would be enough. He didn't need to explain anything, or try to make me feel better. 

“Colessa is so kind, but I can't help feeling jealous of her. I even told Julia this, and I think that made her dislike me. One time, in homeroom first thing in the morning, Colessa walked into class wearing a purple beanie with two points on the top. I jokingly, it was just a joke, I said that she was wearing the beanie to hide her horns. Then she suddenly got all nervous and PMS, because she was so afraid of others finding out she was an angel. Even though it had nothing to do with it. She became so rude as well, and she complained like crazy about me afterwards to the other girls. But then as soon as a different girl went up to her and told her something similar, she didn't react at all and laughed about it with them. It was really weird, I felt like she was singling me out because I was an angel, and she was ashamed of being one or something, I think she was disappointed and upset to see me here.”


“You mean she was pretending to be human?” Nathan said.

“We all pretend” I said, “But sometimes you forget that you're pretending, but maybe she believed it, she was a good actress, maybe. That's why I was so surprised when she got so upset over something so small.”

“I told him everything, about the time I walked back past Julia's house after Julia passed on. Julia's Mom had moved and there was a new family living there now. The lights were on and they were having dinner and talking about whatever happened that day for them. But it felt like Julia's Mom was left out, that she had finished visiting her home, and had now moved to visit somewhere else.”

Nathan kicked another ball away, the boys yelled out thanks. I was afraid that he didn't care about it, or did he just not understand what I was trying to say?

“There was a boy staying in Julia's room, I could see all sorts of LEGO buildings leaning against the window, and the light went off when he left the room. It was all just so...normal. I felt like everything I was feeling, it didn't exist anymore, like it shouldn't exist at all. Everything could swallow on without tension. I felt like this wasn't Julia's house that I visited, that they had packed up their house and moved it somewhere else.”

We walked in through the school, into a more quiet section, past all the lockers with things stored inside. Julia's locker was on this floor. We had wandered up to it without knowing. Or had I known and wanted to come here?

I stopped in front of it and started to cry when I saw advertising being pasted on its surface, inviting the owner to the Prom. The other lockers had already had theirs taken down, but Julia's was still there, untouched.

“Julia wanted to join the Recycling Club” I said, “So I agreed, but then she would always turn up late, like very late, and then I got upset and told her to be there on time. So she agreed, and then the next day she was there on time, but I had to do something suddenly, when I got there I was late, and Julia ignored me, because she was so upset.”

“Then after she died I went back to the club meeting again, this time running to make sure I would get there on time. But when I got there I was still early and peope hadn't showed up, and then I realized that Julia wasn't here anymore. Usually she would be there waiting for me, because she had promised to come on time. And then I just sat there crying. That was one of many times I cried about Julia. Because it didn't matter anymore if I was late or on time, Julia wasn't there anymore.”


“I understand, Shhh” Nathan held my head gently like a teddy bear, “I understand Colessa, you don't need to worry”

“It's Colita” I said,

“I understand Colita, no need to worry”

### Chapter Forty Eight 

_So.....I thought that was a kind of cool chapter where we learn about Colita from what she wasnt' telling anyone, but finally lets loose to Nathan. But what did Nathan think of all that, was it too much for him to bear? Does he find himself less interested in Colita because of it? Or does he adjust to her tastes of things as well?_

_Then, there's the (sort of large) problem of the...story itself, where does it go next? What happens? What issues are there that need to be solved..._

_And finally, I think Colita questions the weirdness that is going on in the school, she finally starts to see it._

“Nathan” I said, “What is happening here? In this school, you know I'm an angel right?”

“I know you're the same as us” Nathan said, “No one who is different from me could make me feel so vulnerable and make me feel like a real person. Only a person can make me feel like a person”


“Matt is shooting everyone up, my boss sees me differently as soon as he got here, and then he also liked Colessa more than he liked me. It just seems like everything was really different as soon as I got here”

“Do you know what he said to me when I left to come here? He didn't say anything, and I had to say, “No matter how much you don't want me to go back you can't cry, you're a guy right?”

“Do you like me?” he said. “Or do you just need me as your pillow to cry on?”


“I will answer that later” I said. “I could hardly stop Max, my boss, from crying when I was leaving for ten months. But then when I saw him back here again, he barely gave me a hug, I was waiting for him to greet me, but he didn't say anything.”

“You can't expect him to know” Nathan said, “You can't 'test' him and expect him to know everything, he's a man okay? He's not some mind reading Captain Spock.”


I laughed at that, “Then he tells me like it's completely normal, that I can just go back home if I want to. There was no feeling in what he was saying, he could have just been asking me to go to the supermarket to pick something up and I wouldn't have seen any difference.”

“He seems so heartless, Colessa was gone but all he had were rules, it took him a while, but he finally understood small things. Colessa was finally gone, He said I could leave, our things were finished, and everything was fine. Our mission was finished.”

“Wait, you mean you don't have to stay here anymore?” Nathan looked liked a fogged up window.

It sure took Max a while to realize Colessa was gone. I don't know what he wanted to accomplish by coming here, but he had only made things worse. His actions were a joke, he didn't know anything that was happening here but just dived straight in and tried to make everything happen his way.

Uh, no. It's just not happening Max.


I woke up next moment and saw Nathan watching me. His pupils became covered in round drops of resistance. They were tired and red things. 

He raised his hand like a windscreen wiper and cleaned his eyes. Then when he could face me again, his face was expressionless, but his pupils were shivering from the coldness of me.

He wiped his eyes again, but near it was unstoppable, the riverbed that had always been dry was now filling up, from somewhere, deep evidence of his emotions were leaking out. It was the liquid of his heart.

(This humorous lighthearted narrator creates distance from the characters and pokes fun of them, makes them look completely helpless in the face of an ever ongoing plot.)


“So you're done here?” He didn't say that, it sounded like something completely different because he was so sad and was half choking, but I knew that's what he wanted to say. 

“Are you going back to the angel world, or wherever you came from before here?”


“Stop crying, that's not like you Nathan.”

“I knew this moment would come, it was something everyone in life experienced. I always knew it would come, I imagined it a hundred times, and I forced myself not to cry in it.”

“Hey” I said, “I'm still here, what are you talking about? I'm not going anywhere yet”


I didn't need to say anything more, and Nathan didn't either, the tears did that. They were like a work of art that communicated something that couldn't be said normally. They told him about me and me about him beyond anything say we could say or do.

So we left it there. 

After six months in a real high school, after talking to many new people and making new friends. On a normal cloudy day with a slight chance of rain arriving in a few hours, but not enough rain to require an umbrella; Colita finally felt something heavy underneath or inside or on top of her, something that was strong and permanent and solid enough not to blow away in the wind like everything else that had disappeared from her. When she imagined this day, or any such day as close to this one as she could imagine, it was always raining, raining hard. And she was standing in the rain with her lips pressed against the boy, they were in a wide open place with no distractions. That was where she pictured she would finally grasp what she had found on that day. Something that was enough to stop her from moving on, Something that was a reason for her to stay.

Right now we were under a roof, it wasn't raining outside, people were talking and laughing all around us, We were surrounded by four solid, polished, uncompromising walls. It was in the middle of a school, where people came and went back and forth like the wind in a tilting building.

I found my lips against Nathan's. We stood there like two statues being admired. My lips touched his, and he was the first person I was feeling in my life. It was better than expectation, better than imagination, it was real.

I had done a lot in my life, felt every part of every body, but this was an awakening experience. It wasn't a special day, it wasn't a special occasion, and it only lasted for a short time. But that day was etched into my memory like something that shouldn't be ever healed.
(Something that shouldn't ever be healed)
(Something ever that shoudln't be healed)


Nathan didn't speak while I spoke, he became like a picture of someone called Nathan that was framed on the wall. It was understanding and never judgmental.

“The only way an angel can stay here is if she gets married, that's like an automatic retirement from the job, but you're also not a fallen angel. It means you've integrated into both worlds in a way. But they will also have to forsake their angel powers.” It was like Japan, they didn't allow duel citizenship either.

When Nathan finally turned around it was with a heavy heart. It was hard to turn away from someone who you had known for a long time, but maybe it was harder to turn away from someone who you had only just gotten to know,and worked so hard to talk to and understand and were so curious about, and could still get to know so much better.

“I don't want to miss you, I don't want you to go either, but I also don't feel like I have the right to hold you back. I've never been able to talk to someone so warmly and nicely” he said.

“There are so many girls here” she said, “You can get with any of them, you're handsome enough”

He laughed, it wasn't the reaction I was expecting. “You think I haven't thought of that?” he said, “I know I can get with any girl, but I don't want any girl, there's only one girl I care about. You.”

No one had ever said that to me. I was stunned. 

“It's just my luck” his sadness returned again, love was an extreme joy and a deep sadness and fear. That's what love was. When he faced you he was happy, and when he walked away he was sad. He had two faces, and depending on which side of him you saw...one couldn't do much.

“It's just my luck that of all the girls I could have loved, I had to fall for an angel” he said. “Why did it have to be you. Now I can't live my life normally without thinking about you, I can't stop caring about you, I just want to help you. But then you say you're leaving. I always knew you were going to leave, that people like you don't just stay here like us.”

He said 'people', he said it so normally that I had almost missed it, because it sounded so smooth and normal, and it didn't take any of his thoughts to say so.

To Nathan I was a person. He hadn't even begun to consider me being anything else.


“Thank you Nathan” I said, “It was great to know you, it is great to know you”

It was kind of weird the way I said that sounded like we were both strangers or something, but it felt like the most natural thing to say right now, so I said it.

And on that normal day, I was touched by a normal boy in the school, but nothing came of it, nothing could come of it.

Nathan understood, because he folded his arms and tried not to cry. Because he was probably experiencing something like this for the first time. Everyone had to go through it, it was unfortunate that he had to go through this slice of life with me.

### Chapter Forty Nine

```
In this chapter I wanted to try something with a new style, something more interesting.

I guess I want to stop worrying about writing, where it might take me, what I can do with it. I just want to live right now in excitement without stress and without caring about nonsense!!!

I guess it's about help.

Thanks as always, 

Sincerely Yours, 

the author

Matt wasn't in class because apparently he had gotten a broken bone while playing soccer.

I didn't have a problem with most things, but something needed to be said. How violent were these human sports? He got a broken bone during lunch break, this is lunch break we're talking about, it was a peaceful time of rest designed as a buffer between one period of busy classes and the next, it wasn't a time for bones to be broken. And it definitely wasn't a time for people to admire Matt. 

But that was my just self talking, actually, Matt being hurt was very convenient to us angels. He was giving us so much trouble that if he couldn't walk for a few weeks then it could be an easy few weeks. 

                                                       AHH STRESS.

I put my headphones on. I scrolled to The Beatles and let them loose. They arrived like Samurai warriors after a long period of peace. 

                                                             CRAZY

This song, Help, I had heard it so many times before, a thousand times before, but it was just that, another song. But as the lyrics went through my mind, I felt like it was coming from me, inside me, and not from John Lennon. 

If I listened to it yesterday, then I would have skipped it like another song, but right now, at this moment, it was speaking to me. It was rude not to listen to someone speaking.

Suddenly I related to everything in here. As I was walking down the corridor I crumbled like an apple falling from a tree and hitting the ground. Like a jenga tower that had finally collapsed after more and more strain.

                                                             SPLAT. 

I crouched in the corner, one hand on the wall that I had been leaning against a moment before. My legs lost their energy and I slowly fell to the ground, or it fell to me, and I was lying on it, leaning against it like it was the wall.


Help, I need somebody, not just anybody
Help, I need someone.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way,
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I changed my mind, I opened up the doors, 

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways, 
My independence seems to vanish in the haze,
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I never done before,

It was cruel that someone so far away, who knew nothing about me and probably didn't care about me at all was saying these things that were making me cry up because they were so true. What was in this world that it was affecting me so much? I never even knew that there was something wrong with me, but now it felt like I was so in need of help. I wanted someone out there, a perfect someone who understood me to help me. Every curve and lump of me that wasn't normal.
This school felt like my home.

I felt so lonely, not lonely, I felt so weak and vulnerable, like something had been missing for a long long time. I wanted to talk to as many people as possible, they might know what I needed. If I could just express it properly, then they would understand me, then they would definitely help me out and help me feel better. I always knew this song, but now when I listened to it, it was exactly how I felt, it is completely true for me.

I always thought I was useless and Max didn't need me around. He was far too proud for someone like me. I didn't deserve him to talk to me. I didn't know why anyone talked to me. What did they see in me?

Someone out there was able to offer me something, something that I valued the most, that I loved the most, and when I said yes, they would give it to me. I didn't know who they were, or what they would give me, but I knew that it had to happen, it was important to me, and to someone else it would be important as well.  So that's why I said yes, that's why I always said yes.

Anyway, Matt was lying in the nurse room with his leg propped up. When I walked in to visit he looked up at me.

                                                            SO ANNOYING

“How are you doing” he said. “I thought about it, and I know you healed me because I'm important to you guys” he said. 

“You thought about it?” I said, “You mean you actually think?” 

“I can do whatever I want and you have to heal me, you have to keep me alive”

                                                         SUPER ANNOYING

“Impressive” I said. “How did you get the PhD to figure that out?”

“I can do anything and you won't touch me” he said, “I'm privileged. I'm beyond a human and angel, I'm a race of my own. That's why you rushed over to heal me.”

Colessa was gone, Julia was gone, and I didn't care anymore. If I was gone, then I was gone. It felt like it was beyond me now. He could do whatever he wanted. He wasn't here to help. He would never help anyone.

“That's why that man stopped you from attacking me, even when I attacked Colessa. That's why you healed me so fast after I attacked that man.” He pondered, “Is that man your boss?”
                         
“There are no bosses in the angel world, only more or less experienced angels” When I finally came to good terms with Colessa, she was abused by Matt. He was in the middle of a lot of the issues. He didn't have to bring all of his hierarchies to our world. Not everyone had to be higher or lower than someone else, sometimes we could just relax being who we were.

“I hate angels” he said, “But I don't have to tell you that right? I won't do anything to humans, but as soon as you tell me you're an angel” he snapped his fingers and moved his one free leg, “As soon as I know you're an angel then I have no reserves, I hate all of your kind. And other humans think the same as me, they are astounded by my actions, because I dare to do what none of them will. No one will protect you after they find out you're an angel.”


My life had changed the moment the necklace came out. But even before that, as soon as someone had told them about us angels. Now his words that used to stab me just touched me and fell to the ground. All around me was a pool of words that he said. I was swimming in his sayings, just swimming along.

“How did you find out?” I said.

“Oh, so you're not going to bother hiding it?” he grinned, “Where's your life force gone? Where's your will to survive? You used to stand up to me about everything. I miss that Colita.”

“It's gone, I mean, I'm gone. You took it” I told him what I thought he wanted to hear, that he was important, and it was also the truth. The more I thought about it, the more Matt was at the core of our problems. It wasn't just me, but just as Colessa said, he was able to change the whole race, the whole of society. But I was too tired to do anything, I just acted the way he wanted me to. 

“Don't you hate me?” Matt said, “I hope you hate me so much that you try to attack me, I'd love that. A woman attacking me. ”


                                                               FUNNY

I had gotten closer to Nathan, found a reason for an answer, but it felt more and more hopeless, I know I was supposed to be excited, but I couldn't so easily, I wasn't that foolish. And it wasn't right to.

“Don't you hate humans too?” he said, “Look what I've done to you. I've made your friend depressed enough to kill herself,  I raped your other angel friend and made her lose her dignity and honor. Then I shot the man who you still have feelings for.”

He was clueless about everything, but he did one thing well, and that was observe me, and do the right things that would ruin me. It wasn't easy to try and ruin someone, especially if you didn't know them well. You would probably look like a fool after a while, but Matt did it well. He was talented at it, in a somber, macabre kind of way.

Surely he wouldn't touch Nathan.


Then the door knob moved, but instead of pushing the door open, they pulled and it didn't budge, then it swung this way and Lacey walked through. She looked a bit frustrated, but that look soon disappeared when she saw Matt. And then it appeared again when she saw me.

                                                  FAKE

What are you doing. It said.

Nothing, I'm just here because I have to, it's not like I enjoy it or anything

You so do, look how you're staring at him uncontrollably, he's MY boyfriend, get off him.

I don't like him, and I don't like you either, why did you have to come in just now?

This whole telepathic conversation happened over a fraction of a second, Lacey's expressions and my expressions said everything. It was instant messenger, girl chat.

I liked to believe I was still young, not a thirty three year old woman, because I could still do such subtle and useless things with other young girls.

Matt shifted in his bed. He gave Lacey the same expression he gave me, which was a blank face, like he didn't register.

                                                        HERE'S MY STORY

If there were a hundred thousand vases in the world, and all of them were made of ceramics, then Lacey would be the vase that was made of paper, photoshopped to look like the perfect vase. That's what I thought.

And I would be the vase that had a lump in it that made it look like a mistake. Mine wouldn't be standing straight and would be leaning sideways. Or the glazing would be imperfect. That's why I always had to lean to the side when I moved, to counterbalance it.

And if we filled all these vases with flowers, probably the water would leak from some of them first.

                                                       GREAT!!!!!

### Chapter Fifty

```
So we're finally at the big fifty, that means....that this story has gone on a lot longer than I expected. (Thanks to your disorganization and scatterbrained thoughts) Who said that?

SO for those of you who are saying that Jun is always going nowhere and saying nonsense and putting random lyrics in...I don't want to disappoint you, but there's still a few more song lyrics to come, and I bet you can't guess what they are. And why Colita would even listen to such songs.

But let me use this opportunity to be honest. Although no one reads this part anyway,  honesty falls best on deaf ears. I feel like so much is happening to me, so much is going on in my life, but if you walk past me during the day or at night, then I am just sitting still and doing nothing much, or smiling and joking about the latest conversation. It's strange, but I guess I want to say that this story means a lot to me. It's like a non-personal diary. But I also feel like it's useless most of the time, not recently, since I can write like this, but whenever I feel useless, then I become more dishonest and less truthful, but more dpeserate to be so...

I'm rambling, but what I want to say is that I really enjoy writing this story, for whoever wants to read it, and for myself as well. And I want to make it as good and healthy as possible. So thank you for reading

Ramblings 1/MANY

```

I found myself sitting in a bar with Lacey, don't ask me how I got here, don't ask me what I said to get me in this situation, or what I didn't say. But Lacey was ordering a non alcoholic drink, and I ordered a non alcoholic drink as well.

“Good on you” she said.

“Huh, how come?”

The bartender stared us down with one eye like a dartboard, he closed one eye and stared at us so randomly.

“He's winking at you” Lacey said, “And at me too, because we're pretty”

“Is that why everyone stares?”  I said.

Lacey was horrified, “You don't know why guys stare, and you wear something so revealing? Do you even know what sex is?”

In a place like a bar, the word comprised of the three letters 'S', 'E', 'X' in that order was heard like a needle dropping on concrete ground.

Suddenly everyone stared. Lacey smiled and took a sip, and eventually the gazes settled back to their boring places. A lot of single men were here, a lot of single women were here as well. They were past high school age, and they all looked like bored princes and princesses occupying their own space and treating the space opposite them with hostility.

If they wanted someone to be there, then why did they have to be so hostile about it?

“I know all of that” I said, “I just didn't know what a wink was”

“I almost forgot” Lacey said, “You're an...”

I stopped her from saying the word, the world didn't have to know I was an angel.

“I mean, it's good you're drinking something no alcoholic” Lacey pointed to my belly and made a mountain.

“Huh, what do you mean? AM I getting fat?” I looked down, then at Lacey in anger. Even after shape-shifting I was gaining weight?

“It's not good for the baby” Lacey said.

“Pregnant? I'm not pregnant” I said.

Lacey stared at me, then waved it off “You're right, I was just joking.”

I thought about it for a moment then asked her again, “Why did you say that? Do I look fat?”

“I was just joking Colita” she said, “Don't think about it too much”

“You're a really horrible person Colita” I said. Why would you even say that as a joke? That's just offensive.”

Lacey hid a smile, or maybe it was just my paranoia, but I got so angry. Who did she think she was to just insult me about something I thought so much about.

“You're fat” I said, “You've definitely put on weight, you haven't lost any weight even after all the sex you have with Matt.”

Everyone's head in the bar turned to look at me. I had said the word again. It was the word that was on everybody's mind here, but was never mentioned.


“Sorry” she only spoke after she realized her victory was clear. “I invited you here to talk about something else”

We were in a bar, she was so much more sophisticated than I was, was this the kind of place that she hung out at?


“I think I'm not going to University” she said.

“You're not?”

“I want to get married” she said, “To a rich guy”

Surprise surprise

“Why don't you get married?” she said, “Oh, right, I forgot, you're an angel so you can't.”

I don't know why she felt like she had to say such things. 

“I want to get married” I said, “Someday”

“You like Nathan don't you” Lacey said.

“I haven't really thought about it”

“Well think about it, and tell me whether you think Nathan would be any good”

“No” I said immediately. Wondering why she was asking me about this, I was probably the least knowledgeable one to ask. Besides, angels didn't get married so it was off the mark for me to be talking about it. It was like window shopping, excpet before I walked into the store I would be kicked out.

“Nathan won't be a good partner, probably” I said, “He seems a bit of a half-hearted lover”

“FRIGHT much?” Lacey lit up, “Right? I also thought the same thing. He seems like he wouldn't be very serious about things”

“He's too thoughtful” I said, “And stuck in his own dreamy world”

“And he doesn't have the James Dean dreamy eyes either. It's like all the negatives of the dreamy thing put together. If you have thatm then you need the eyes, I mean come on, please!!!” 

I didn't want to laugh, but I enjoyed how I could talk about Nathanj with someone as random as Lacey. She seemed so civilized when it came to things about boys. But I also felt discouraged that she knew Nathan so well, did he also talk to her in the same way? How close were they? Did Nathan really like me, or was that how he was with every girl?

“Even if everything depended on it” Lacey said, “In the end of ends, at the finish of a drama or something, I wouldn't cast him for the role of the tragic hero, if you know what I mean”


“I wouldn't either” I said, “He seems like he'd run away as soon as things got serious” Lacey and my visions were similar, we had the same taste in men. I feel like as soon as everything depends on it, then he won't protect me”


“So would you marry him?” Lacey set her cup on the mantle, it sounded like a skull cracking...(I wouldn't know what that sounds like, but Lacey might...:)...)

“Why are we talking about this?” I said,

“What do you mean? This is just it, that's all, Does everything you talk about have to have some greater grand purpose or something?”

“No” I said, “Is this enough?”

“Yes” she said, “Yeah...I think it is :)”

We sat for a while, refusing seconds for our drinks.

“How about Matt” I said, “Would you marry him?”

“No” she said, “He's just a piece of meat to me, but he's too violent for anything else”

“You know him well” I said, “Have you had a heart to heart with him?” 

Lacey sighed, “I tried, but nothing came of it, I tried to tell him things or ask him things, I told him everything about me. But he doesn't seem to care, he doesn't open up and doesn't say anything, he's just always quiet. I don't know what he's thinking.”

“That's why he's so scary” I said.

“How about Jason?” she said, “Marriage material?”

“He's just another guy” I said, “If I get bored, then he might be the safety net, but otherwise...I don't think so” I shook my head like a fan.

“Guys in general” Lacey said, “Are unreliable, some guys are more reliable, the reliable ones are probably the less popular ones that we don't really think about or talk about as much.”

“You sound like you have someone in mind” I said, “The way you talk about it...”

She faked being upset, “I can't hide anything from you, I can't tell you who it is though. You're going to think I'm a player, because I have sooo many crushes, I tell one friend each one, so they all know someone different, because I have to talk about it. But I've decided that I can only tell my best bestest bestie friend about all of the crushes.”

“Me?”

She smiled, “I haven't decided yet, but I'm looking for someone to fill the position of being my bestie forever”

“But you do right, that's why you're saying this. There's one guy you really like more than the others.”


“Yes, but I haven't told you it yet, so it's not true” She said, “As soon as I tell you, then it's the absolute truth.


“Whatever” I said.

“And you might steal him from me if you know, because he's the perfect guy. My vision is correct a lot of the time.”


“Okay” I said.

Then what Lacey and I were talking about changed, just like the weather suddenly clouds over or empties, our conversation became something about Lacey that I never knew existed.

She had seen all of Quentin Tarantino's movies, every single one of them. I mean it didn't make her stand out as the single person who had done so, but it made her have something besides boys that she was interested in.

She talked about him the whole time. And I knew that she knew I knew nothing about this quirky human director, but I was glad that she trusted me enough to speak to me. Althoguh we had argued so much and hated each other to opposite ends to the world, right now I was glad that she could feel open enough to talk to me about this. Maybe it was because we had weathered some of life's most demanding tasks together, but right now I was listening to her talk about something I had no idea of.

“Tarantino's style is less serious, at least I think that, but it's very convincing and exciting to watch. Everyone is so different, he could probably never do anythign else. Matt and Jason, if they were to become movie directors, they would probably do something different as well.”

“That's true, Lacey” I said, “That's very true”

“And when people say his movies are 'convincing' it's like they are more important and what they say matters, but to say“Convincingly” is to say that they persuade, and that some things aren't convincing, and that's not true.”

I nodded, although I didn't understand, I was glad to just hear her talk about something that she cared about.

We ordered a huge amount of drinks, but afterwards leave them all behind without touching them, the bartender drew a picture of Lacey on one of the glasses with the foam, but Lacey left it behind without touching it.

She just saw the picture and laughed. Her finger circled the glass like she was playing the piano, or holding a big genital.

She laughed probably because it really did look a lot like her.

### Chapter Fifty One - Colessa the Concerned Twenty Two Year Old.

```
So...that chapter wasn't melancholic right? In fact it was kinda random how a bartender came in...But you got to know Lacey better, no?

Nervousness, feel like someone is clenching my heart...

But it is gone with a few words.

-Shakespeare (Not really, haha, I wish...)
```

> THE BACKSTORY of COLESSA

“Colita” she called me, her voice was young and ripe. I consumed it like a madman.

“I heard you got with Max” she said.

“That's right” I said, “So? It's none of your business?”

“He's arriving now” she said. “He was promoted, so that means your boyfriend is now something like your boss”

Then Max told me I was pregnant with his baby. I don't remember his expression, his face was covered in darkness, the shade was particularly strong that day, his nose stood out like a pool ball on a dimly lit table.

But I remembered the weather, I always only remembered the weather. It was slightly chilly that I decided to wear a loose coat, but not the thick on that would obstruct movement. Then Max called and said he wanted to talk to me. I wrapped my hair in a gentle cloth, and my jeans were not too skinny. I wasn't dressing to impress anymore. I knew Max well enough for that.

As I said, I don't remember his face, but his voice had so much intonation happening at once that it was like the climax of Mozart's 'Jupiter' symphony. I pictured him repeating that sentence again and again, and I could never understand it fully.

“Colita” he said, and a bit of warm air drafted through my hair and my left ear, pinching and taking some hair with it as it went. 

“You're pregnant” he said, “He's mine”

I nodded. The air was dancing with me today, it wanted to give me some company in this slow waltz.


“Your baby's going to be a human” he said, “He won't have your powers, he won't be able to do what you do”

That was fine, he was just stating the facts. But I knew from the way the air hesitated that he had more to say, more things that he never should have said to someone like me.

“How does it feel?” he said. He asked me scientifically, he didn't care about the answer, he just wanted to know it.

I said something and he nodded, assessing my answer. Max wasn't a father, he had never chosen that career, he was an analyst, a researcher, anything but a lover.

“I've found that all angels are the same” he said, “We all act this way and swear fealty to equality and our rules, but deep inside, each one of us feels very lucky to be angels, and not humans.”

I didn't care about what he had to say, his theories and ideas and feelings didn't matter. What mattered was how were we going to raise this baby? Why wasn't he going to be here with me? Was his work more important than us? Why couldn't he answer my questions? Why did he think what he was thinking was more important?

Then I looked at the angel roster, how there were so many of us, each was able to shape shift, each of us was unique and fun to be with. I was nothing special. 

So why did Max choose me? Was I important to him, or was I just another girl who he was playing with, who he was analyzing, like a cold nugget of data.

When I was almost ready to have the baby, the doctor looked inside me, he said he was surprised because inside me was the same as outside me.

I never knew what he meant, but I thought about it a lot, it was just one of those things that kept me thinking about stuff a lot. But I felt like one of those Russian dolls. If you opened me up, you could peel away my skin and inside is the same me looking back, a smaller verion of me that fit inside the big one and was waiting the whole time. Just like an onion, or a wrinkled cabbage leaf. You could peel me away and have the exact same me. I am always consistent and the same. The smaller version of me made friends, whereas the bigger me didn't really, because the smaller me was cuter.

Then when my baby was born, I named him 'Colita' after his mother.

But after he was born the doctor said that my baby didn't have his genitals. It was a rare condition specific to angels. Sometimes some parts didn't come out properly, or as they were supposed to.

“You weren't concentrating” Max was upset, “You should have done the job properly, it was the only thing you had to do, and you messed it up.” He said a lot of other stuff as well, but that's all I remembered.

So, I didn't give my baby his genitals, they were still buried inside me. I never did my job wholeheartedly. I forgot to give my baby his most important parts, and that's why my son was still a virgin. Because I had forgotten about it, my mind had been busy at the time.

Max had a lot of things he was upset about, he suddenly blurted out that he wished he had been with someone prettier and with more logic, someone more similar to his calibre. Our levels were just too different. From the way he said it I knew he had been thinking about it for a long time, probably before we even started dating, it was one fo those things that came with first impressions.

Then when I cried he apologized immediately and took everything back.

But the blood had already seeped into the tablecloth, and it could never be removed, unless that part of the tablecloth was cut out and thrown away.

So that's what happened, I threw Max away, and he threw me away. Like tissue paper.


And that's why men couldn't be trusted. They made you give them a new life, then they ran away, most of the time I was just another person to him. No matter what I thought of him, how dearly I held him, what I tried to do for him, he just came and went as he pleased, like a cat.

Now as soon as Max saw me healing someone he punished me, because it wasn't official and was unacceptable.

This whole mission was based on hopes, Matt was seen with hope, that he might help us solve all of our problems of inequality, everyone looked to him with hope. And maybe, just maybe that might be what was causing him to get upset. All he saw wherever he looked, was hope, our hopes. And that was upsetting him, so he retaliated.

I wasn't shallow, that's why I didn't judge others; 

Our hope was also well founded.

### Chapter Fifty Two - Max the Persistent

Max had my necklace stored in a safe next to his bed. Well, to be precise it was the nurse's bed. I knew it was there because he put it there as I watched.

“Do you know why I'm not hiding it?” he said.

“Because you trust me?” I said. “You know I won't go behind your back and steal it”


“No” he said, “It's to let you know that this is my necklace, and I can do whatever I want with it. It's not yours.”(Max's character through dialogue, something only he could say)


“Are you listening?” he said. I wandered around the room like a mosquito looking for something to suck. But Max had nothing, he was as empty as a waterless vase. It was only good for decoration.

I was going for a long walk outside when I overheard two people talking. One was an older lady who looked like she had last been to school over a century ago, the other looked to be her daughter, she was a century minus twenty years old.


“You see, everyone want to, but the reason people can't be more direct is because everyone is so different. And as a safety net, you have to say certain things and not say certain other things. It's like testing the waters before you say the real thing, because you don't know how this person will respond. It's a fear based system, but the result is that you have a lot of half committed relationships without much to say or do. And you don't really know someone until much later.”


The older lady nodded, and smiled, and nodded. They were walking in front of me, then I overtook them and walked on. I bet that after I went past they began talking about me as well. Their conversation never stopped, and it talked about everyone around them.

I hoped that they would say something nice.


I wandered around and found myself in the bar that I had been with Lacey a few nights ago.

The waiter had dyed hair and tiny eyes, everything about him screamed asian, but I didn't scream it, I accepted it normally, he was another person. A bit weirder looking, but another person.

Someone else approached the bar and started talking to the waiter like they knew each other really well. “I'm Japanese” the waiter said. Then he looked like he had completely thrown away his culture, sitting in a western bar, with western people around him, speaking a western language, and laughing about western jokes.

He was like me. He had thrown away his culture and stood here. He had forgotten where he came from, and didn't care at all.

“So, are you Japanese?” I said.

He looked at me, not as a person, but as a woman. “I'm gay” he said. “And, I'm not really Japanese anymore, I'm New Zealander now”

“Okay” I said, “Thanks :)”

I thought we were similar, but when I talked ot him I realized it was just my ideals, and actually we were different. He seemed happy to be who he was now. 

And I should be happy too.

“I prefer making this Japanese style coffee though” he smiled as I left.

Later Matt;s hatred for angels resurfaced and he grabbed the grenade in his pants and threw it at Max's bed. He bed exploded and Max;s life instantly blew away like a daily newspaper ripped up.

I rushed to school and saved Max. I had to. As he lay there fast asleep, he looked like a carcass that had been chewed up by lions, then I laughed at the joke, because he was an angel.

But after I laughed, I took out the necklace from the drawer, surely in these circumstances I was allowed to heal him right? He was my boss, even if I was out of commission I should still heal him right?

Then I pictured the world without Max, what did it look like? It looked exactly the same, whether Max was here or not, the world didnt' change. Only his perspective of it did. But the world didn't need his perspective, it didn't need mine either.

But as I healed Max, the bed was burning. And as he healed I felt something cold against my throat, the coldness wasn't relieving, it was sharp and threatening. It circled my throat like a sickle cutting grass that was overdue. The Grim Reaper.


It wasn't the first time I felt this, but I didn't have anyone to discuss it with. When I healed Julia I felt the same presence, like an impatient being was asking me to stop.

Maybe he was the culprit of everything. His name was probably sweet sounding and kind. But his job was not. Maybe Matt and Jason and Nathan found out about me being an angel from him. Now it was frustrated and using agression to force me to stop healing its victims.


When Max woke up he still remembered everything. “I wasn't afraid” he said. Then he looked at himself, to make sure he was okay. He knew I healed him, and if I was going to break the rules he wanted me to do it properly. If I had missed a spot, I would face his wrath no doubt.

“People who heal me always ask me about it afterwards” Max said. “Did you meet him?” He groaned in the bed and shifted his weight around. “You must have, it's death. But don't be afraid, he's after me not you.”

Max looked at me with bloodshot eyes, his brows were dipping into his eyelids, and wrinkels ran up the side of his face. He looked so tired and old that I suddenly wanted to cry.

“I'm a monster” Max said, “So many angels have died following my orders, my own death was due a long time ago but I run away from it myself while letting others die. I'm a coward.” He lay back in the bed, his skin was pale and cheeks sunken. “But if you see something like that coming after you then you'll be afraid as well, it's the scariest thing in this world”

How many times has Max died? How many times had he been healed? How long had he been running from everything? Why was this man allowed to be an elite angel?

“I talked to him once” Max said, “When I was a lot younger, it felt like a dream and I'm not sure if it was or not, this was way before he became frustrated with me. He had this strange voice, like a weak boy. He was complaining like all of us, about high taxes or something. He needed to pay it every time at the end of the week. He told me that he can fetch a higher price from women than from men. And that the highest price comes from an angel's death, because it's such a rare occurrence.”

Max sighed, “It's strange right? I don't even know if it's true or not but I dreamed it, every word, and I remember it all like it really happened to me. It's something that I can picture death saying.”

I smiled, because to Death, we were all the same. We were just worth a different price, but otherwise there was nothing to distinguish between us. We were all unable to communicate properly.

The Death that Max described was so feeble and weak, it was almost human too.

“I had a dream” I said, “About love”

“Love? What's that got to do with this?”

“I'm not sure if it's real either, or if I'm just imagining it, but in this dream I looked one time and noticed love, then I looked again and noticed love again, dressed in different clothes”

“Is that really what you saw? Or are you just trying to make fun of me?” Max didnt' like when I had the same experiences he did, it made him feel less private and elss special. Because he had so much pride in what he held inside him.

“Do you know what I mean?” I said.

“No, explain to me then”

“Love is always different with every pair of people. The way to recognize death is the same, you have to be willing to see Death as something different wherever it goes, whomever it touches. Some people have been dead since they were born, some people have been dead for a long time. Some people never die. Death is as fickle and indecisive as a teenage girl who reaches out to everything and finishes nothing.”

“No” Max said, “They're completely different, then how would you explain my dream? Are you saying my dream wasn't real?” Max also didn't like to be contradicted. I guess in that way he was like every other man.

“The way to recognize death” I said, “Is probably to look for something different, if someone is always the same and wearing the same clothes, saying the same things, concerned about the same things, then they are a human, but Death has no consistency, it's always moving and always changing, because it has to cover so much ground. It's a public figure and not a private one who specializes in broad friendships rather than intimate conversations.”

“What are you, some poet?” Max was trying to be right, because he was afraid of losing. That's all it was, a battle of who was right. What we were talking about didnt' matter.

“That's only what I think” I said, “It has nothing to do with your opinion so don't get upset.”


“But there is only one opinion” Max said, “Both of us can't be right”

“Fine” I said, “I'll ask him next time.”

“You'd better, because I want to know”

### Chapter Fifty Two - Nathan the Virgin


“Not me” Lacey said.

“No, not you, but everyone else” I said. 

“Yeah, don't lump me in with them” she said. Lacey and I had a free period so we were sitting in the primary schoolplayground and sitting around. As we played here I wondered if we would ever remember these times again. Would they mean anything to us? Then, what would Lacey think of me?

“I don't like you” she said. 

“I'm sooo over you too, girl” 

“Dont you get sassy with me Miss, I'm the queen of sassiness”

We both laughed like teenagers. Well...I wasn't, but Lacey was....so I guess it was normal for her....so...I can take that back...and yeah...whatever...


Anyway, Nathan turned up out of nowhere. He had a head of confidence and walked like a boss, like a hitman homed in on his target.

He looked at me nonchalantly and went up to Lacey.

“You're on the slide?” his voice sounded out of tune, like his comfortable frequency had slid away.


“Yeah, do you want to join us?” Lacey looked at me out of the corner of her eye. The look was loaded, but I wasn't sure if she wanted me to go over to flirt with Nathan, or if she wanted me to go away and leave the two of them there.

I looked down then awkwardly slipped away. Lacey had probably invited him here to talk to him. Nathan couldn't take his eyes off her, he hardly noticed me here. He probably thought about her way more than he thought about me.

But it was tough, because I thought we had gotten so close. Couldn't he just say Hi to me, or at least wave at me to show that he saw me here?

As I walked away Nathan called out. His normal voice had returned. “Colita,where you goin?”

“Just....away” I smiled and turned around, then was shocked because he was right in front of me, he had ran over.

“Boo” he said, then looked away in embarrassment, “I tried to surprise you, but you saw me...”

I stood amazed, then I started laughing. Because of how ridiculous he looked, and how he cared about me. It was relieving.

“Come and join us” Lacey motioned to the slide, her look said Why are you going away?

Because I thought you wanted me to,...

Look, I know you like Nathan, so this is your time to spend with him, make sure you do it well

Lacey smiled when Nathan looked back, he hadn't noticed anything in between us. The communication between us girls was so thick, but Nathan only heard a few words.

The iceberg was so deep and so shallow.

After about an hour, after which Design technology class had already started but we skipped, Nathan began to talk about how he never had a girlfriend.

“How come?” Lacey had been pressuring him for the past thirty minutes, and we were slowly getting trickles of an answer out of him.
 
“If girls knew about me, they won't like me” he said.

“About what?” Lacey said.

“I'm not a man, because things have always been different with me” 

“What do you mean?” I said.

“I mean that people are always talking to me, and always expecting things from me, but I have no idea what they want”

“You mean, as a man? Is that what you're worried about?”

Nathan sighed, “What I'm about to tell you” he said, “You can't tell anyone, okay?” He looked at both of us, “Tell me if you still want to date me after I tell you this”

I grinned, was this a secret? I loved secrets.

“My lips are closed and will never open again” Lacey closed her mouth with her fingers.

Which was the biggest joke, since Lacey was only THE biggest talker in school.


“I don't have a penis” Nathan said.

Lacey made the sound that people make before a huge bout of laughter. I followed along.

“Don't laugh” Nathan said.

“That was funny, trolling us was really well done, ten points for creativity.” Lacey said.

But Nathan wasn't laughing, he didn't even breathe. 
We slowly stopped laughing and looked at Nathan. He really wasn't laughing. He was as silent as a potato.

“How come?” I said. My eyes unconsciously flicked down to his groin. 

“I was born without one” he said.

“You were born without one?” Lacey was still struggling to hold back her laughter.

“I have balls, and all the surroundings, I just don't have a penis” 

Lacey couldn't help herself and burst out laughing, then I had to follow, it was easier to let it go then try and hold it in. 

When we had finished, Nathan looked a whole lot sadder. “Is it that funny?” he said.

“Show me” Lacey said, “I won't believe you until you've shown me”

“I dont have one, that's what I'm saying” Nathan said, “I have nothing to show”

After more laughter Nathan took us behind the school and dropped his slacks. His underwear was grey, and he peeled that down.

Then he was as empty as a vagina, beside a mound was two balls dangling like confused mussels from a body and connected to nothing between them. Their father was missing. 

I felt so guilty, Nathan stood there unable to look at us even. He looked away, then at us, it was so awkward for him. This was all because we didn't trust him.

“What the.....” Lacey wasn't laughing anymore. She fell on the ground in shock. She was initially horrified, but after that passed she turned to me with a sorry face. 

He can't have sex. She said. I'm so sorry.


It was true, I ddin't even feel guilty looking at him in public, because I didn;t see anything that felt violating. But that meant that it was true, I felt guilty for embarrassing him, and not trusting him, forcing him to show us. But it also meant he wanted to show us, he trusted us that much.

“So...” Nathan buckled up his pants and looked up, his hands fresh from his nether area, “Do you still want to go out with me?”

“Do you still like me?” he said.

“Do you still like me?”

---

### Chapter Fifty Three

My interest in Nathan wavered after I had seen all of him. I know it was vain and it was shallow, but I couldn't help feeling differently about him, like he was pitiable and on a different level. I could still talk to him and hang out with him, but it would always only be as a friend.

“Don't worry” Nathan said, “I'm used to it already”

I went to visit Max, Matt was asleep, and Max was writing something in his notes. He was scribbling hard with a pencil and paper, and erasing lines and writing numbers and muttering thigns in frustration.

“Max, do you know people use tablets or iPads or digital devices for that? It's so much faster”

“Don't mind me” he said, “Are you doing your job?”

“Matt's here” I said, “Don't worry. Wasn't the missionc alled off anyway? Wasn't it a false alarm, there's actually no assassin is there?”

Now I was saying this I didn't actually care if the assassin came, if they finished Matt off, the world would probably become a much better place anyway.


I had gotten courage and decided to tell Max my piece of mind. I had too many pieces of mind to tell him.


“Colessa told me that humans are lower than angels, if it wasn't for the job, she would never save any of them.”

“Go on” Max said, “Listening is the most sincere form of respect I can give you”

“You're not giving me anything so get over yourself already” I forced a laugh and went on, 

“When I heard that, I realized that I was following the wrong place this whole time” I said. “Colessa was still lukcy for a while because the most important thing about her, her identity, was still confidential.”

“The most important thing? Is that all you think of Colessa? As an angel? Why do you always have to split things in black and white, good or bad. When I was going out with you I was always Mr. Good guy or Mr. Bad guy, never anything else. Seriously, there's a lot more to life than just the edges.” 

“Well, look at us, our appearances don't matter, what we say doesn't matter, who we like or don't like doesn't matter, how old we are doesn't matter, all that matters is if we are an angel or not”

“That's not true” Max said.

“You haven't been living in this school, that's all they care about”

“You've made friends haven't you?” he said. “You're going to throw away everything you have, all your past, for a few humans? You're an angel Colita, don't forget that. Don't let these humans influence you.”

“Isn't it these humans that we work for though? Their opinion should matter, and from the way they act, they don't need us, we just need them and are clinging to them helplessly. The msot important part of me is still confidential, so I'm safe.”

“That's what Colita is saying, not Colessa” he said, “You're twisting and interpreting her words differently, as it pleases you”


“Why don't you believe me, how come you have such a high and good view of her, but you don't even trust what I have to say?”


“That's not true, I'm just judging everything evenly”

We stopped there, took a few breaths before going under. Max spoke like a Mahler symphony, long and took a while to build up. But when he was finished it was like something had really hit, and hard as well.

“Human problems are petty” Max said, “I've heard them, they argue over things like sex and lust when they could be productive and work together to accomplish things, to polish their craft and undertakings instead of standing still and arguing night after day. Because of this some others are really behind and having trouble keeping up while other humans are extremely rich. A huge gap forms. Colita, when you stop for a moment from what you've been told and take a look, you'll see what I saw, a great distance that has been made between not only humans and angels, but between humans themselves. It's sad really, sad.

Should an angel feel bad about it? We're not human, it's got nothing to do with us right? so it shouldn't matter to us. These are human problems we're talking about, humans and their problems have been traversing the earth from before angels existed. Who are we to try to induce change to this ever calamitous world”

“right” I said it just like that, like e.e.cummings would.

“But that's why”, Max said, “That's why we need to do something right now, you see us angels were born to save this earth, to save humans from themselves, because they can't do it themselves. So we have to suffer when they treat us bad and ostracize us, but it's our duty as angels, as lovers of humans.”

My tears flowed like a waterfall, three thousand litres.

“We're all digging” Max said, “A human singer John Lennon said something about knowledge, the further we go the less we know. He said a lot of stuff like this, and I can relate to it as an angel. A person digs down into the ground but hits the bottom, never finding anything. So he decides to dig somewhere else. But the happiest people are those who live on the surface and never dig down, because they don't feel the need to dig deeper all the time. When you dig down, you are further from the surface. So they are satisfied standing where they are. Some people dig a hoel and never go to any depth and start a new hole somewhere else. Others will dig one hole their whole life and never see the surface. But in some ways, the further you dig down, the less related to the world you are and the more you disappear off the face of the world, and everyone's conscience.”

“I didn't say that” Max said, “It was an important person or something who said that. Someone who knew something about the world and wanted to do something. But that's why I think we should work hard to change the world, us angels are here because of a purpose, so sometimes we need to be able to sacrifice what is most important to us, what we want to do, to be able to benefit the human race. Because we were born with the power to be able to affect it.”

“But...” I said, “I feel like I can't change anything, all I do it listen to others and follow them, I don't do anything for myself”

“Whether you affect others or not is not up to you to decide, sometimes you can't see your own changes” he said. “So you have to listen to others.” 

I remembered others praising me, and Julia. “But if I have to follow the rules, then how do I help people as well?”

“We have to follow the rules” Max said, “It's just something that we have to do, it's an obligation as an angel.”

So could I really live my life the way I wanted to if I had to be an angel as well?


I spoke slowly, heaving tons of thoughts into a few important words, I knew that if I didn't say it properly now, then it wouldn't strike Max in the same way, and I only had one shot, one chance to do it. “ A lot of humans, they're wounded people, but some are more wounded than the others? I am the same, so how can wounded people be trying to heal other wounded people as well? It feels like a big hypocrisy. I know you say angels have a great power and responsibility, but to be honest I can't really follow it anymore.”

“I respect you, thank you for telling me what you really think, it's not often that I get to hear it.” (Was that good or bad that it wasn't often...) “Do you still smoke?” he said, “I really enjoy your smoking, and would like to do it with you again if you don't mind” 

“We're all smoking” I said, “Julia, my friend, was smoking as well, and Colessa was as well, we're all constantly burning shorter and shorter until we're thrown down and trampled on.”

“Don't speak like that again, you always talk like this when you're upset, you need to calm down.” 

“I'm calm” I said.

I realized that Julia was one of the few people who also respected me, I needed to talk to other peoples to realize this, because there was so little respect going around, it was hard to identify sometimes. But Julia's cigarette was shorter than all of the other ones when they were being made. She drew the shortest of the lot, it was as simple as that. So when I was healing Julia or Colessa, I felt like I didn't have the right to change peoples' lengths. I shouldn't be the one doing that, I wasnt good enough, and the way I did it just wasn't as good as others.

“You know” I said, “It's pathetic, because even after all of this, after what you've done to me, all the rudeness and indifference and pride that you've showered down on me, I still love you, and I'm still helplessly in love with you”

“What are you talking about?” he said, “Is it that time of the month for you? Do you need your necklace?”

“I'm not a human” I said, “But I want to be one. It's the only thing I want to do.” I went on, like the rain at an intersection. I told him everything I thought, I told him, that one day I would write it all down and it would be a grand story about the most important moment for angels. Right now where we were, I would change it and let our history change. And even though Max yelled at me and cheated and ran away from his baby, I would try and make Max sound as good as possible. I would also try to make the angels look as sad as possible, and unfortunate, then it was finally ready and everyone could read the story. I would split the story into two halves, Part One finished when Julia died, and Part II consisted of everything else, but I wasn't sure how it would end yet. (Make it ambiguous whether this story we are reading now is in fact the story Colita has written, or the end.)

Then I told him about how I told Julia about us angels, I told her that she couldn't tell anyone, and I told her that humans were lucky, because an angel's biggest dream was to become human. 

“Do you know what that means?” I said, “What kind of equality are we trying to create when we have to keep our presence a secret? Why can't we stand proud of who we are instead of hiding in the shadows like worms and slugs? Humans have no idea of how much respect we have for them, because all I want to do is become a human”

“When Julia died, she never should have, but she did. And it makes me feel worse, because it proves that these humans who we aspire to can be so unhappy. And then what does that make us angels? Even more unhappy?” I wanted to laugh at how ridiculous angels and humans were. 

“But then they found out about the angels” I said, “Someone told them”

“It was Julia” Max said, “You told her, so she told the others, because they're all humans”

“No, Julia told me she didn't tell anyone, and I trust her, it was someone else”

“Who then” Max said, “Tell me your story”

“It was death”

He fell silent, “Death has never spoken, he's too tired to, besides, why would he care at all?”

“I don't know” I said, “But I think so”


“There have been rare instances” Max said, “When death came to the forefront to affect a situation. But it was only after he had obtained permission from a veritable authority above himself. But that's so rare that it's more likely to be the assassin who said it.”

“But the assassin doesn't exist, you said it yourself!”

“I don't know, okay” Max said, “Everyone's saying something different”

For the first time I saw Max unsure, he had his own absurd theories and beliefs, and as a boss he had to juggle everythign else, how did he cope with it? Of course there were things he didn't know about, it wasn't fair for me to push all of my troubles onto him, like we were moving chips at a casino. It was just surprising, because I thought I could always rely on him, because he knew everything and had it all under control, even when I was panicking, he always knew the answer in the end.

“You need someone to listen to you” Max said, “And I'm not saying I'm any different, I'm the same as well, we all need someone to listen to us,because literally all humans can't, our lives are too different to be able to talk about the deep stuff together. Their lives aren't as rich as ours, so ours are naturally deeper.

“True” I said. Then walked off.

“Where are you going?” Max called out.

“I've had enough”

---

### Chapter Fifty Four - The Student The Biased

Every time I opened up to Max he just got all angry and judgmental. I needed someone to listen to me, because literally all humans couldn't, it was just something a girl needed every so often. It wasn't asking for much. Colessa wasn't here to listen, and apparently Max wasn't either.

“Are you thinking about me not listening to you again?” Max said, “I listen to you for hours, and at the end you just say I wasn't listening or something, I'm trying my best you know.”

“Well I feel like you just talk about whatever you want, and I have to agree with you, if I disagree then you just shut up like a clam and don't say anything.”

“That's not true” Max said, “I tell you everything”

“But You don't let me talk, and you're not interested in what I have to say, you just want to know if it relates to Angel. Corp or not, and if it doesn't then you switch off”

“Well, that might be partially true”

“I can go on” I said.

“You don't have to” he smiled.

I was so dissatisfied talking to him, what did I expect from him? He wasn't any different, even after all the pestering I gave him he hadn't changed, guys were incapable of changing anyway.

Do you remember that student who was standing outside the theatre? The nerdy looking one without many friends who told me that they were doing Shakespeare in the theater? Well I ran into him again, he was really nice to me, so it was easy to get along with him. He didn't expect anything, and I could feel comfortable with him.

Besides, our sense of humors matched.

I learned that he was really studious, which wasn't a surprise, but he also respected me and my study habits. (Don't judge, I had to have an excuse to talk to him)

“Can I get your view?” I said, “Mind if I ask you a question?”

“No, go ahead” he smiled. I think I could have said anything at that point and he would smile.

“Do you think I'm pretty?” I said.

“Of course” he tried not to look elsewhere and kept his gaze on my eyes. “You're one of the prettiest girls in this school”

“Oh, don't say that” I waved it off with my hand, but wanted him to continue.

“It's true” he said, “I've never seen a girl so well mannered like you, and so knowledgeable, but you're also popular with the guys and everyone wants to gon on a date with you.”

“Do you?” I hope he didn't read how desperate for his response I was. He was an outsider unafflicted by the maladies of our opinions, he could offer some truth.

But was it really his view I wanted? Or just agreement? Or did I want validation from Max? I didn't know anymore. But I had to ask.

I'll tell you a story” I said, “From both points of view, and can you tell me what you think of it”

He nodded

“Princesses are always human. No one's ever heard of an angel princess. If a frog dresses up in princely clothes does that make it a prince?”

He didn't hesitate, it was like he had thought of this before, “The frog was a prince the whole time, long before anyone started calling him a frog, or even a prince for that matter, his essence was a prince, so he was a prince. It's as simple as that.

“Well, here's the thing, I'm nothing like that, I'm a fool who dresses in a necklace”

I pushed him to the side of the room and peeled my layers off. When he turned back to the middle of the classroom I was naked, except for the necklace. 

The student's eyes widened, he tensed in nervousness. It was probably the first time he had seen a naked female. I could see his groin straining against his pants. 

So he did find me attractive. I was starting to wonder.

He came over to me, put his arms around and removed the necklace. He dangled it on one hand. He looked at my breasts, at the soft nipple tips that twitched under his gaze, at my valley starting to soak.

He took my hand and put the necklace in it and wrapped my fingers around it.

“This is yours” he said, “You have to keep it” Then he took a step backwards, still tense, poor boy, it was probably really hard for him to control himself.



“I'm obsessed” he said, "Put your wrapping back on" he said.

“When Matt saw me” I started, “He said to me, 'You can dress in human clothing all you want, you're still an angel, angel's shouldn't exist in this world, they're like a sickness that keeps eating people and destroying them. Human suffering has existed from the moment angels were born. You're a threat to our peace and well being. I will eliminate every last one of you."

“That's what Matt said?” he nodded, “And I agree with him”


That came out of nowhere, I was shocked.

“Humans will eliminate every last one of you” he said. “I'm a nice guy, so I'll let this slide, but you tried to seduce me, to drag me down to your standing, but I'm better than that, I was raised with morals.

As I stood there in front of this stranger naked, I realized I was unwanted, and I was starting to feel cold. Even this boy wouldn't touch me after he knew I was an angel, after stripping me of my necklace, was there something inherently 'angel' about me that made me unworthy? Why couldn't I be treated the same as all the other girls in the world.

My only way to prevent me crying was to talk, keep talking, until he would respond with something nice. “Matt also treats humans badly. No one knows what his motives are, why he does these things, he doesn't have a reason, he just does it. He told me 'You don't understand me, I'm too modern for you, I'm too sophisticated, no one will understand me for at least another hundred years'.

The student heard it and nodded again, a big nod, like he was falling asleep, except his hand was on his chin, and his chin was well shaven. He saw both points of view, but he couldn't stop staring at me. He stared at my round breasts with large knobs in the middle to open a door if you twisted and turned them enough, at my bellybutton like a pachinko ball entrance to a lottery, the bullseye of a dartboard. 

“I don't know” he said, “I'm not too sure what Matt meant, but he had sex with you right? I mean, you had sex with him right? If you want me to judge you objectively, then I will need to do the same as he has done, I have some darts, let me touch you and really try to give you a good objective opinion.”

“But you said I was disgusting, you said I wasn't human.” I had always been getting opinions from everyone, but no matter how much I asked and how much I learned it only appeased me for a short time before I needed to get another dose of information. Otherwise I started to feel insecure and paranoid about it. Him telling me I wasn't a human wasn't so bad, but I was afraid he might say it.


So I stood there, for the first time in my life my hands were shaking. I wanted to yell out and destroy something, yell at something about someone that was happening. Why couldn't they see that I was human too, there was nothing different about me. I even gave birth to a human.

But it didn't work. I just stood there in front of him, still naked, and he was still horny.

“What if you 'test' me and in the end you don't like me? In the end I'm not good enough, then what?” I said.

“Then it was a fair test” As soon as my clothes had disappeared, so had any of his logic. Men were all shallow and useless like that. Telling us women not to judge about anything, to respect their territory and independence. But then they went around abusing women. It was a pattern in society, as soon as women tried, or thought about a man, we had lost.

I turned around and sat on the chair, my Butt cheeks splitting on the corner, pushing out like a big roller. My breasts sagged like eggplants and my hair wasn't as straight as it used to be.


"A friend of mine called Julia told me to never stop searching, so this is my vengeance, what I owe her. I'm living a lot of my life to pay back the big debt I owe her.” I didn't care if this student was listening, I didn't care if he had left, I didn't care if he was just staring at my body in hunger, I was saying this for myself, “She told me, Colita, never stop searching for those morals or for that righteousness that will make you and make you, and finally make you”

I talked and he stood there, mesmerized by my presence. 


Julia kept resurfacing in my past, and I started to question who she really was, a normal girl wouldn't keep coming back and back, maybe she was a lesbian Julia that I could blame for my troubles now. Or maybe she was a depressive, or maybe she was just unlucky. She was always a different person.

“You think I'm unpopular right?” the student said, “Jason told me once, when we were talking about girls, we said Colessa, and Jason got excited and told us guys the things he would do to her. This was in the changing room before one class. Then we mentioned you, and he was also horny, and for Lacey as well. Jason's an accepting guy, we all know that, he will take any girl without fuss, he's just open to it, and he doesn't want to hurt the girl's feelings.”

“Jason? Compassionate?” We all learned something new everyday.

“But he said no to Julia, Jason said he wouldn't date Julia because of her appearance. He didn't want to admit it, but he talked to her normally and joked with her, and she had an excellent personality, this is what he said. But her looks just weren't up to it, and he couldn't sleep with her. He said he wasn't vain, he just wasn't interested in girls like her.“

“Why are you telling me this?” I said.

“You respect Julia so much, but to us guys, she wasn't attractive at all” he said, “I just wanted you to get your head straight, we were actually kind of happy that she's gone, she wasn't fun to look at and was actually kind of annoying.”

Actually guys were super vain, and it was because of terrible guys like these that girls became insecure. Men made up all these excuses to say things about other things, but actually it was simple, no one wanted to admit it. They wanted sex, and they wanted it as soon as they could, and they wanted it with someone beautiful and attractive. They didn't care anything about if the girl had personality or if a girl was funny, or respected him, or treated him nice. All men were the same, they were out to sleep with the slimmest prettiest and most anorexic women. It was a shame that women had to live with them, being a lesbian would be the best profession. “I'm a professional lesbian, Lezbehonest.” 

I was wrong, this student wasn't an objective opinion, he was just another sheep in the herd who couldn't see outside. I felt sorry for human women who had to tolerate these berating men.

So who wasn't?

### Chapter Fifty Five: ...

```
Hey, listen up ya'll cause this is it, these pills that I'm swallowin are full of sh**.
So, this chapter, might not be everyone's cup of tea, because literally NOTHING HAPPENS, so if you want to read the next thing that happens, you could maybe, ahem ahem, skip this chapter and make me a sad wannabe author. Or, you could read it and try to enjoy it for the reason that...I enjoyed writing it?

Anyways, lets see, here goes:
```

I was tailing Matt today. Because it was part of my job, at least it had been. Matt had met up with Lacey in front of his house and the two boarded a train together. I happened to board the same train, and walk the same apths as them, always a few minutes behind them.

They stopped at an icecream store and bought an icecream to share. After they left I bought the same one and licked it by myself. They walked into the movie theatre and watched some TED talks, I sat a few rows behind them and watched the same show.


Then Lacey left for the bathroom after the first talk, Matt moved his hand away from her shoulder to let her out. Then when I went to the bathroom I heard her voice in one of the cubicles talking to the voice of Mrs. Triangle. Lacey was telling her about how her date was going, where Matt was taking her. It was a Skype chat. Then Mrs. Triangle asked Lacey if Matt was just stringing her along, because he had sex with half the people in school.

“I'm not serious about him anymore” Lacey said, and that was the end of it. “But maybe he is, I don't know”

“If he is, it's not good of him and I hope he feels bad about it, a good and beautiful girl like you gone to waste”

I went back to the cinema and watched Matt. He didn't move a hair, he welcomed Lacey back to sit beside him and talked to her, but that was about it.

Then after the movie I followed them to the mall across the road and overheard a random snippet of conversation from a girl and a guy walking past.


“Cities are rare, most people don't live in them, they live outside them.”

"No, that's not true, everyone lives in one too"

"Yes, but not everyone lives in them"

I didn't follow Matt and Lacey into the mall, I had seen enough to know what people did usually, instead I went to school. It was a public holiday today, and I saw a familiar face pacing back and forth around the school gate.

It was Julia's Mom, she was walking around after school, 

“Hi Colita” she said, “I'm looking for Julia, the movie is starting now, what time is it?” She peeled up her sleeve and checked her golden flickering watch, “Oh my word it's almost starting, she promised to watch it with me, we do this every month”


I couldn't tell her Julia was dead. She had already gone through that pain, and was deflecting it onto the world.

“I can go and see it with you” I said. “If you don't mind”

She sighed, “I guess my own daughter doesn't want to watch it with me” She handed me the tickets and chucked me in the car. It was a silver seven-seater, but she had so much stuff in it that it looked like two seats. Posters and rolls of paper, all sorts of crazy antiques.

The movie turned out to be the same one that Matt and Lacey had been watching earlier, so I rememebred every scene and didn't react. But Julia's Mom was crazy, she was crying when it was just a bit sad and laughing when it was hardly funny.

“That was a great movie” she said afterwards, “I wish Julia saw it with me”


There were no barriers in what she said to me. That's why I didn't feel hurt when she said that. But also because 

“At my work” she said, “There's a really cute girl who wears the red uniform, when you first come you don't know what uniform means what job, but afetr a while you find out”

I didn't know why she was telling me that, and I think she lost the plot as well, she stopped.

I rewatched the same scenes with her, that Matt and Julia had seen, and me as well, but I couldn't tell her anything, because there was a barrier that I still held up.


If I have a daughter” she said, “I will raise her properly, then the world can see her and think, 'my what a well behaved and polite daughter, I hope my own daughter will grow up to be somepme like her, then I will be a good mother'.There is a big baby, it never leaves the house, protected by its own pure ideology and world view. But once the channel is broken, it will have to leave and see the world. Then it sees how the world is a big wide place, broken and made anew. There are so many new cycles. The cycles are circulations and without them everything becomes stagnant. A good mother protects their children from the world by teaching them rules to keep them small. Sometimes I think I could have done a better job.”

### Chapter Fifty Sicks: Colita the Thinker

```
So I don't know what you thought of last chapter, but this one is also kind of the same, not much action, just a lot of words followed by nonsense etc.

But it's an important time for Colita, because it shows us how she is thinking about what has happened to her, and perhaps for the first time she is going to move on in her life, and not be running from it anymore (Japanese Drama bells ringing anyone?)

So let's see how she deals with it.

And If I haven't already said so, then please excuse my poor writing, please excuse my boring chapters, and please excuse my general attitude in life, I know it's not healthy and productive, but it's all I can do...>TT< so please, help this sparkle. 

As always, no surprises here, 

your author
```

I got home and was reminded of myself when I was down. Julia's Mom was out of control, she had so much grief that there was no trace of it anymore, but it was painting all of her actions like a renaissance painting had been broken down into a puzzle and reassimilated into something incomprehensible.

I wondered if I also looked that ugly when I was in grief. 

I usually never talked to anyone and just minded myself. I was as quiet as a lightbulb and as sad as a pinhead.

My thoughts followed me to school the next day. During lunch I sat alone, and afterwards went out onto the fields where I could sit alone without anyone watching me or thinking I was weird. Then I saw one of the Japanese girls in school, she was always smiling and kind. She still bowed her head a lot, and I think she was starting to wear make-up as well.


She was sitting there with a sunhat lit up bright when a guy came up to her. He was one of the sporty types, he talked to her about soccer and his hobbies. I noticed that she was cute, the way she spoke back to him.

To her it must have been something important, this interaction. But to me watching them, it wasn't much, it was just another guy in school talking to a girl. Even if there was the strongest love blossoming for them in their world, I couldn't see it. They could have been so in love that everything else in the world was blotted out, but no matter how strongly they felt, I still couldn't see it. It was a selective blindness.


If any of us stopped moving or running, then the dreaded figure would come. Death, insecurity, anxiety, weakness. The more people there were the faster I had to move, because there were more death's around. Every punch I tried to land would miss. It was death's job, not for leisure, it kept food on the table. If his mother or father or brother, or colleague came along and stood in his way he would still cut them down. I guess that was something to be admired, a passion so bright that it was blinding everything else.

When I saw them I saw how private our lives were, how individual. It wasn't just me, it was everyone.
But I also saw death, not more easily too.


But recently I had been running for so long that I lost my breath, it was getting harder and harder to keep up and I would never reach my destination.
Every year I just kept getting older year after year after year. I felt like each year death saw me and laughed a little harder. At my futile resistance.

And I felt like if I said my true thoughts they would be ignored and disappear into the air. I wouldn't be respected by others any more. That's why I put on an act, and was  afraid of others finding out my true self.

It was because I had been acting for too long.

The bell rang and the ground cleared, the soccer ball stopped rolling and was kicked to the side. All the students walked past me, some looked, some didn't. I stood up and smoothed my skirt out and went to English class. 

It was in the afternoon and everyone was sleepy. The teacher tried to teach, he really wanted to, but he couldn't, and he checked his emails while we had a reading session of Anna Karenina.

I didn't have my book, so brought out my Mp3 and scrolled to the song I was feeling.

What A Catch, Donnie - Fall Out Boy

I've got troubled thoughts with the self esteem to match,
What a catch, 
what a catch, 
what a catch, 
what a caaaattttchhh

After class I went to Julia's locker, she would still have the book, her locker hadn't been touched. Her library books were also in there. 

I tried a password but it didn't open. SO I banged on the locker and tried a different one, I kept repeating until the lock became soft and tender. I just kept trying different combinations, hoping one of them would work. Julia's birthday, Julia's Mom's birthday,  Lacey's birthday, random numbers, the day we first met, anything I could come up with.

I couldn't not do the act because I couldn't accept the death. I thought that if I could open the locker, there might be an answer, or something in there to satisfy me for now.

I never imagined that life would be so lonely when I started school, but now I was starting to feel that way, I was surrounded by people, but that only made it more lonely. It reminded me of what I couldn't have. And when Max and Colessa came, I was supposed to feel more comfortable, but everytime I talked to them I was reminded of how much distance had grown between us, and how I was so different, and I couldn't connect with them anymore. The more we specialized the less we could adapt to change, the more opinionated we became, and the more independent and self involved I had become.

That's why I wanted Julia here, because if Julia were here it meant that I wasn't wrong, and I could be confident with myself. 

Recently I thought of her more and more, without her I felt so useless and weak.

Then I tried a different combination on her lock and it clicked open.

The door swung open naturally, the lock was no longer holding it shut. And inside was nothing, it was empty.

But the combination to open the lock had been my birthday.

“What are you doing here?” Lacey had her arms on her hips and was looking at me across the hallway, the sun was behind her and I couldn't see her face, the sides of her hair were lit up like flakes disappearing into the sky, and her legs were spread apart, making a big menacing shadow across the corridor.


She was alive.

“What was the combination?” she said, “I couldn't figure it out”

“It was nothing much” I didn't want Lacey feeling jealous, it was important to me as well.

“Do you want to talk?” she said, now her hair wasn't glimmering on the sides, she was right beside me, and I had my back to the sun, the window shone bright and my hair was probably glimmering to her, my face was also shaded.

“Okay” I said, “Where would you like to go?”

“Let's sit there” she pointed under the staircase and we made our seats. She crossed her legs and faced me. “So what's up, you've been really quiet lately, even quieter than before”

“Was I quiet before?”

“Well you annoyed me when you were talking to Matt, but otherwise you were fine”

“I'm sorry” I said, “I can't tell you, I can't tell anyone”

“Okay” Lacey put her hands on her legs, “If you don't want to tell me that's fine, but let me tell you something, okay? Think of it as something that I want to say”

“What is it?” I said.

“I'm anorexic” she said. I didn't reply, I was just being quiet, why did she feel like she had to tell me this? How would telling me help anything?

“I always used to be anxious” she said, “And really insecure, and it's the same with anorexia, now it all gets channeled to my body, it's really similar, but in different environments and lifestyles to other anxiety.”

Then it hit me, was she telling me this because she thought I was anorexic as well?

“I've never met a person who thinks she's pretty” Lacey said, “Every girl wants to know that they are precious gorgeous and beautiful, those are probably the three things every girl wants to hear. I was stranded at home for a while, getting really thin, eating irregularly and not admitting I had a problem.”

I could emotionally relate to the messed up situation she was talking about.

“But then I met you” she said, “And it all changed, all my anxiety was channeled into something else, like jealousy of you, fear of you, it was a new source of adrenaline, so almost overnight I forgot about my anorexia issues”

“Healing happens like that” I said, “One moment you are healed, overnight for no reason, and then next moment it has transferred somewhere else”

“It?” she said.

“The problem, the malady, the thing you don't want”

“Do you remember that day you apologized to me?” Lacey said.

“You mean when you forced me to?”


“If you apologize, does it mean that you are wrong?” she said.

“I don't know, that's not for me to decide”

And then just like that, with that one conversation, the two of us had become friends. It was unexpected and ordinary, but it was the same. I didn't know why Lacey was telling me things, and I don't know why I cared, we lived in different worlds, but we were very related. She talked of her anorexia, and I felt that it was similar to me not relating to humans very well. They were both similar issues we tackled, so maybve we became friends through treading through the same problems through out lives.

But I could only become friends with her after Julia and Colessa and Matt were cleared from view. Candles always cast shadows on things closest to them.

If I had been born a human, or if Lacey had been born an angel, there was no doubt about it, I felt it strongly that we would be best friends.


I'll admit” I said, “I've got my problems, but I can't tell you about them, I don't feel comfortable to, yet”

Lacey nodded, she probably already knew, that's why she had told me about herself.

“But” I said, “I will live with my problems, everything I do, it stays in me, and I have to live with it.”

“I respect you” Lacey crossed her legs again, “I respect the way you live your life”

“And me too” I said, “I respect the way you live your life Lacey”

She smiled, “More and more, I feel like I'm standing at a crossroad, I'm just torn there while everyone is walking past, if I go one way then half of my body will be left and go the other way, if I choos the other one, half of my body is stuck on the other side. I am torn in two no matter what. Weird right?” She laughed with a weird noise.

“That's not weird at all” I said, “It's sad”

“You're so honest, you shouldn't say that” I said.

“Some things” I said, “Theyr'e just inherently different, they're out of our control, we only control a tiny part of our life and the rest is just flowing, it just keeps flowing on and on, and because we try to control it, we really don't have any freedom. But if you let it flow, you still don't have freedom”

“Wow, I don't understand anything you just said, but we can laugh about it right?” she said.

I never expected to talk to Colita about something so profound, I thought she was always a make-up doll. I knew I shouldn't think that way, but it was my way of understanding her.

But I was glad to be able to talk to her.


Later that night I thought about what Lacey said and was amazed. How did she, who was so out of it think of something so amazing, I would never be able to do that. I started feeling the familiar tinge of insecurity that just kept growing more and more.

A huge surge of wave came and swallowed me, it pushed me underwater. I saw it coming and tried to swim early to dodge it, but it wasn't effective. I knew I was a human, I knew I had a place in this world, I knew I was related to everyone else here. But the intense fear overcame me, it made it hard to breathe and speak, even sitting here was uncomfortable, I just wanted to run off without anyone knowing, I wanted to keep running and moving so that I didn't have to think about it.

As I went under, the wave swallowed me, and I knew I absolutely knew, more than anything else in the world, the certainty of it was frightening, but I knew that I would never be the same, I would never measure up to the others around me. I would never ever be good enough.

It was the scariest thing I had ever felt, from anywhere, nothing anyone said and nothing that had ever happened to me scared me in the same way.

It was a fear that once you touched, once you saw it you could never recover from, and a crevasse opens in your heart that has shattered you forever.

 And as I went under I saw inside the wave that it contained all of those that I didn't heal in the past.

I lay there, barely breathing, my mind was spinning out of control, it was like a metal atom that was being pressured on all sides and forced to collapse and explode onto everything around it.

I lay in the grass pulling my hair, my hands and feet were waving, but I wasn't going anywhere. Then I stopped and looked at the sky. It was always there.

I realized everything. I don't hurt right now, but I must be feeling pain, because I'm not happy, and I must be feeling pain, because I can't distract it away anymore. I was so numb from all of the pain that it was hard to tell whether I was happy or sad or even felt anything. I just wanted to yell out to be able to feel something again. 

To let the world know I was here.

### Chapter Fifty Seven - Colita the Depressive

```
By this point I know that nobody has actually read this far, it's probably not very interesting anyway, who cares about Colita's story, what she's done, what she hasn't done. By this point no one's reading anyway so I can write whatever I want.

I used to be able to just stop and look away and it would be fine. 
```

I turned on my Mp3 and blasted Rachmaninov's second concerto into my ears. The undulating piano chords killed the world. 

I kept turning the volume up, until I couldn't feel the rain falling around me, I couldn't hear the trees rustling, and most of all, I couldn't hear a word around me, I didn't want to hear anything that anyone was saying, what they had to say, what they thought I should hear. I killed it all with Rachmaninov's music. He must have felt the same way when he composed it, no one could talk this clearly to me without feeling the same way.

Now I had to have this music at full volume now, otherwise I would go insane. I needed something to agree with me. 

As I lay there lsitening to it, and when it finished I repeated it, and when that finished I repeated it again, until even my hearing had subsided and the world completely disappeared from all senses. And then I wondered if this was how it felt to be dead. Would a dead person agree with me?

It took me a while to gather all my thoughts together into a story that I wanted to keep telling. It was a story about an angel in a human world, no one wanted to listen, but I wanted to tell it anyway.

Music, to me, was like acknowledging the existence of something in the world. When I listened to singers, I felt like I was really meeting and listening to them, and they were helping me, and had their way in life.

When I finally turned the music off, I heard myself weeping. Hot tears were racing down my cheeks and landing in the grass. And even those who hated me, the trees and the wind, they were also crying for me, even though I was their enemy.

My headphones lay in the grass, still pumping.

### Chapter Fifty Eight - Colita the Clump


Whenever I cried, I felt like an idiot, I felt embarrassed for being in the middle of nowhere and having all of these emotions about things. No one even cared if I was an angel or a human or a whatever else, they genuinely didn't care. It didn't matter, it doesn't change the world. I'm just sitting here sulking by myself.

Sorrow was such a private thing.

Then the wave returned, I had hardly swam out of it when the insecurity came pummeling back at me like a hungry beast ready to ravage me. 
It was insecurity about something that I just couldn't understand, I didn't want to talk to anyone, so I wasn't sure about it. But I was afraid of talking to someone. Because what if I told them it and they didn't understand, it made me feel so weak, and even when I tried they wouldn't understanbd me, I was so insecure whenever anyone didn't understand what I was saying, I was just completely upet by this. 

A minute ago I hadn't felt like this, I never knew what I was going to be feeling. It was so tiring to live like this.

Sometimes I was a boiling bubble of lust ready to pop like a pus boy, other times I was as quiet and polite as a mushroom. But that's why I didn't want to tell anyone about it anymore. I didn't want anyone following my footsteps too closely, because I didn't know where I was now. But also because then my own footsteps wouldn't be seen, and would be covered.

### Chapter Fifty Nine - Colita the Actress

When I found my wauy to the next class I saw Lacey standing outside the doorand doing her make-up, she held a small mirror to her and touched her lips and hair like an artist.

Then after I went in Lacey sat next to me. I don't know why, I never dared to look up at her. It felt weird.

But what was weirder that I was smiling so easily, like I hadn't been crying a moment ago. I was a completely normal girl if anyone saw me, I was always happy and never farted and never pooped, and most of all, I wasn't able to heal anyone.

No way I had been so sad just now. When I smiled so much I also began to believe it, how could someone so happy and cheerful and making jokes have been so sad? It wasn't possible, not for a human.


Mr. Gilbert stepped to the side and welcomed the drama teacher in to share a message.

The teacher was the same one who I had acted to, the one in the middle who everyone else agreed with, without any hesitation. Mr. Gilbert even respected him, it seemed. Because the teacher owned the place.

“Sorry to take up a bit of your class time” he wasn't sorry at all from the way he said it. It sounded like he was here to talk and we had to listen.

“I'm going to be straightforward” he put his fingers together like a web, “I'm here because I want to recruit new students for our new play. Now indulge me to use the next ten minutes to show you my vision.”

He was a true drama director, he had a vision, he had students to act for him, and he had the original flair of a crazy artist.

Without asking for them he got nods of agreement from everyone. He was that kind of person, a person who inspired nods from everyone.

I wasn't someone like him.

He started talking about the play he was going to cast, the roles he needed.

“We're desperate” he kept saying, “We desperately need actors for this play, all of your parents are going to come and watch it, don't you want to act for your parents? It's going to be great fun. We're desperate.”


“Here's the story, I thought of it myself” He looked at the front students as he spoke, he looked over them one by one, as if already casting them for the parts he was describing. I think he only looked there because his vision only extended that far.

“There's a few girls, six of them in a group”

The moment he said 'girls' I thought he was perverted. When a grown man like him was thinking of making a play about girls in a high school, he had to be perverted. It was weird.

“Of the six girls, one of them finds a best friend, and then she leaves the group temporarily, it's genious, it's like the next Shakespeare romance. She tries to rejoin the group, but she can't because these girls all live in different worlds.”

The students in the front fell silent. “Oh my gosh, that's so true” Lacey said. She dropped her mirror on the desk and picke dit back up to check her reflection.

“The one girl who is separated tries to change her appearance, her boyfriend, her grades, anything to try and fit in, she will even tease others to try and climb the ladder back to these girls, her best friends.”

“Are there any boys?” One fo the guys in the front raised his hand and asked.

“Yeah, each of these girls is walking with their boyfriend. But because the girls are always doing things, we really wonder what they think, it's all very ambiguous and turquoise” He sparkled his fingers, like they meant something special.

“But the girl is separated from her friends and she gets depressed, slowly slowly, it's like you are fishing and have caught a fish and are hauling it in slowly, so super slowly, so that you are completely focused on it, you know the fish isn't going to get away, but there's always the hope that it will. And you know what's going to happen to the girl. She's slowly saddening and breaking down. But there's always the hope that she might break free, that she might become something special, like a fairy.”

Lacey covered her mouth and looked at me, “Fairy, can you believe what he's saying? Everyone knows they don't exist”

“They soo don't” I couldn't believe he was so insensitive.

“This girl” he went on, “She becomes a suicidal girl, each time she goes back to school with more slits on her wrist, her friend notices new bandaids up her arms. Her friend peels one off,and sees that they're deep wounds, and her friend feels so bad for not being able to do anything about it.”

Everyone in the classroom had fallen silent, they were all imagining it, this person. But it was cruel because I couldn't imagine it, I already knew it. This was the story of Julia. This teacher was making a story based on Julia's last days. I couldn't listen to him, it was horrible.

“Basically” the teacher said, “The most violent and messed up one isn't anyone, and what hurts everyone is something different”

“That's a weird story” a boy at the front said, “Why would you want to do that play? You could do something a lot happier, there's no need to make anyone cry”

“It's a happy play” he said, “Don't you see? She faces her truth.”

“I already cast the main girl character” he said, “But she refused it.”

He was talking about Julia, she was cast for it, and that was the last straw she could take, it was the last week of her life, where she had to act as a suicidal depressed girl who wanted more friends.

“It's funny” he said, “Her friend just peels her bandages off randomly, so strongly, it shows how her friend is so different”

“I don't care about how it shows things” I stood up and yelled at him, “I don't care about your story, you're a horrible messed up and mean person, I hope your drama never happens”


The teacher was shocked for a second, but he gathered his composure and looked at me, he smirked, like he knew something to damage me.

I was confident he couldn't hurt me any more than I was. Even if he knew what would hurt me, I was already damaged goods, long before he said anything.

“You're not even a human” he said, “What would you know”

The most violent and messed up one wasn't a human. They were all right for criticizing me. I felt that.

The teacher handed out some forms and left the room, he didn't look at me again. He didn't have to, what he said had already sunken into me like a holy Cathedral.

I later heard that the teacher had always disliked me. 

Sometimes all of our thoughts were misleading. That's what Robert Plant said, and he probably meant something completely different. 

I later found out that they said that after Julia died, instead of talking about Julia, they said a girl attempted suicide twenty times and finally did it, that's what they called her, 'girl', as if they didn't know her anymore. And they only talked of how she was midway acting through a play acting as a suicidal girl.

I had been clueless about it until now

“Come on, you were her best friend, how could you not know, don't lie, you knew all along.”

“No I didn't, I swear I knew nothing about that, if I knew I would have stopped it.”

“No one talks more than a liar, you're actually happy she's gone aren't you, it's her own fault though, for acting and behaving like you did, you asked for it.” They were blaming us as the victims.

To other parents, it was kind of like a message of hope. They now believed they had twenty chances to catch their children before they really died. And I felt it was criticizing Julia's Mom's parenting skills, because it sounded like she didn't do anything. Like she was the one to blame.

All in all Julia's death, her death, was just news to the world. Sometimes emotions were the hardest thing to come across, and sometimes they were the hardest things to relinquish.

### Chapter Fifty Nine - Max the Adversary

I told Max this story, of the drama teacher coming to our class and telling us about his play, which was basically Julia's story. And he took her life and put it into a script and completely disrespected it, disrespected her. It was the worst thing you could do to a person who could no longer stand up for themselves.

It was after school, the bell had just rung and I rushed here, students were still walking in the halls, getting things from their lockers and catching their buses. Ten minutes later the buses started to turn on and cycle around the school and leave. They were like big container trucks carrying the loads of the school out. I couldn't explain to anyone why I was so fascinated watching those bus loads of kids moving out of school like that, but I kept staring. And ten minutes after I finished telling Max, and I had stared enough, then Max replied. 

He was in much better condition that he had been. He was almost fully healed, the bullet hole was gone, and his cruelty was back.

I finished telling him the story and I got upset at it all over again. But Max heard it said something completely male.

“You're completely the same, think about why you're telling me this, it's because you're exactly the same as her, your friend.”

“What do you mean?” I said.

“You're also the same, for as long as I've known you you're sad, quiet, depressed, and even half suicidal, you're always thinking of sad things, staring at the nature, at the world, at people, because you don't fit in. Even among angels you don't fit in”

“No, that's not true, I'm talking about her, this isn't about me”

“It is, everything you say, everything anyone says is about them, and about you. It always is....and it always will be. That's just the way we all speak.”


I hated Max, as soon as I opened up he had to judge me based on it. He didn't even listen to what I had to say.

---

### Chapter Sixty - Colita the Mother

Max wrote something down on a piece of paper. “Enough about this friend of yours, or whatever, there's something more important I have to tell you”

“Again?”

“Our mission is coming to a close, you're free to go home now” he said, “We've confirmed that the whole thing was a six month long fluke, there was no assassin, Matt is under no threat.”

“Then why are you here?” I said.

“I will deal with Matt” he said, “I will negotiate with him to try and get him to work with us”

“Umm....just in case youd didn't realize, I mean, I don't mean to put it out there for everyone to see, but for the record, he shot you, point blank, twice, okay?”

“Yes, but now I know, I can approach him with awareness”

I don't know what Max meant by awareness, I don't know what he meant by intelligence, or wits, or learning, but I let him go.

“I need to tell you this” he said, “Before you go home”

I looked up at him, he was still as emotionless as ever, I really couldn't get anything from him, even after I thought we had become so close, he just talked like none of it mattered. Were all men like this? Were they all expressionless lifeless creatures who were unable to talk and communicate?


He reached over and asked for my necklace, I gave it to him, again. 

“Your son” he said, “He's in this school”

“What?”

“I did some searching and found out that he's going to this school”

“Well, what's his name? Who is he?” My world had suddenly opened, my own son was here, he was right here, so close, I could finally meet him.

“Nathan” he said, “His name is Nathan”

My fingers fell, “Nathan?”

He nodded, “Have you met him yet?”

I took out a pen and paper and started desperately scribbling something I wanted him to read, right before my rights as an angel were revoked after I lost the necklace for good. “I have to write this, before I become nothing.”

“You can just tell me later” Max said, “Is our son a nice kid?”

“I'm writing it all down” I said. “You can read it later”

“I don't want to read it, I want to hear you say it, I'm not wanting to read a book of your life, a play, or a song, I want to hear it from you.”

“Well, I can't tell you, it's not the same” I said, “After I'm not an angel, then it doesn't matter anymore what I write, I have to do it while I'm still me.”

“I still love you the same” he said, “Whether you're an angel or not, what are you writing, you can tell me.”

“I can't tell you, read it later after I'm gone”

“Okay” Max said, “I'll read it later.”


I finished it and went walking back home.

### Chapter Sixty One

I walked past these houses almost everyday, and I had noticed an old man always walking past, but today I saw him more clearly, it was like I was focused on him.

There were two houses side by side, one was where the old man lived, as I walked past, because the air was thin I overheard them talking, then I went to the next house and overheard the family of the old man talking around the dinner table. Whenever I was on my way to school I heard the same thing again in the opposite order.

The old man sat on the veranda sometimes, sometimes he would wave to me, sometimes he wouldn't. Sometimes his kids were also sitting ther with him, and he would be talking and asking them to do things, but the kids hardly responded.

It was interesting how I could catch their life from just a single impression, That was us, we all lived the same lives, with just one fraction you could tell everything about us, because the it was what was showing above the iceberg, continuously spinning and refreshing itself.

Then the old man would bring out a packet of sweets from under his chair and the kids would turn, like tortoises changing direction with great effort. He always saw the kids gobbling up packets of sweets, so now he did the same. He offered them out to the kids. Then the kids listened to what he had to say, the stories he wanted to tell.

Even during the short time that I was here I noticed that the old man's health was deteriorating fast. He used to be able to walk around, but now he was always sitting at the veranda. He was taking pills every morning and evening. He was too tired to smile, and just walking around had him leaning on a walking stick and panting. Even while sitting down and looking at the world flow past, he was panting.

Then when his kids ran past and shouted and played tag and hide and seek he yelled at them, because they were doing something he couldn't do. Something that he wanted to join in with. Then he would call out to them and move his leg rest to take out the opened pack of sweets he had. The kids ran to him and he would tell them a new story. When they lost interest he asked them to do favors for him.

When I walked past the next house, I heard the kids complaining about their Grandpa, how he was always making him to do things for them. But the Grandpa thought the kids really liked him, because they greeted him politely and gave him their attention.

He could only see the world from his chair, and the TV, and the world scrolling past.


One day the parents found out and told Grandpa that they wanted him to say something important, he needed to be a good Grandfather. They were really troubled, especially his daughter in law, who was trying to raise her kids to their best and nicest.

I thought it wasn't really a big deal, but people made it a big deal and they made it sound like their life was dependent on it.  That was the symptom of age, It was evidence that time was around them, it created problems because something was always grinding against humans. Something too big to notice.

Later the parents got angry at the Grandpa for feeding their kids sweets, that day was a month ago, when I was walking back after a particularly bad talk with Lacey. A few hours after Matt shot Max. I bet these people didn't know that a few blocks down, a girl committed suicide, it didn't matter to them. It mattered to me a lot. And they didn't know that I had been talking to Lacey and Nathan and Jason, and Matt.

Then about a week ago, the old man brought out an alarm, it was also under his leg rest. His daughter in law had come over, so he showed her how he had already cleaned the lawn, he had picked up the rubbish, he had taken out all the stuff. All early in the morning. He taught the kids some useful new Chinese vocabulary. 

Then the daughter in law was so happy and embraced him.

It was just a different form of candy, but we all laughed at each others' candy like it wasn't important. Or like it was important.

But all this story was just useless nonsense, what was the point in listening to others anyway. No one would listen to me.

I was so full of myself.

The real reason why I noticed these houses, this family, was because I heard them and saw a loving family, something that I really wanted to be a part of. I was always moving around, my ex-boyfriend didn't care about me, I hadn't seen my son in such a long time, and my friends were always changing and never stuck.

Now I was watching them and I saw a few kids run past, then right behind them were older kids who were helping the old man go to the store with them. “Grandpa” they said, “Grandpa”, and the youngest of them said, “Grammpa”

I stood there as they walked past, I moved to the side to let them go past, the old man was smiling so big and talking to his grandchildren. 

I couldn't stop staring, the two older boys saw me, as after they had passed I heard them,

“She was staring hard, do you know her?” kind of thing.
“She's hot” the other boy said.

### Chapter Sixty Two

```
Bear with me guys, there's a few more chapters to develop our people's, and then then, then, then, then, BAM BOOM DOOSH, WOOOOOO, we're going to launch straight into it like BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM, and then the story is going to start moving again.

That's only if I can stop feeling so alone in this world.

Always a pleasure :)
```

School was starting to become dull, I had nothing to do here anymore. I was just waiting for Max to reassign me to a different mission. To another boring mission that angels went on. I think school had been too much fun and pain, and now it had affected me, desensitized me from everything else.


I spent my time at lunch sitting quietly, I enjoyed sitting alone. But I must have looked lonely. Then I finished and put my tray away, going out to the football fields.

I was surrounded by three boys. Nathan, Jason, and Matt. Lacey wasn't anywhere around their orbit.

“Oh, it's Colita” Nathan said, he walked over. Jason and Matt followed him. They both had grenades in their groins still. Jason looked normal, cool and relaxed. Matt looked like a monster, as always, he had healed from his wounds completely and his arrogance was gradually returning.

But he didn't say a word to me. 

I tried to balance with the boys, if I could become good friends with them then maybe I would feel a lot better. “Hey guys” I said.

“Are you going to leave soon?” Jason said.

I wasn't expecting anything like that, Jason and Matt were always so mean to me, I was half ready to throw a diss back at them. But when I looked back up, Jason looked concerned. 

“I thought about it” he said, “I don't know anything about angel life, or your life cycle, or metamorphosis”

“It's just life*” I said. “Keep it simple?”

“Are you going to leave soon?” he said.

“No” I joked, “What are you guys getting so serious about, I thought you two, Jason and Matt, hated me?”

“So you're not going to come back?” Jason said.

“I don't know” I said, “It depends on Max, my boss”

“The dude Matt shot?” Jason pushed Matt, “See I told you, you never should have shot that guy, he's controlling Colita.”

It seemed like Matt didn't mind being pushed around by his friend.

“Why are you acting all kind?” I said, “You made my life intolerable for thelast few weeks, what are you doing here, now?”

“I was just flirting with you” he said, “When I see you walking down the hall I'm actually so happy, I'm happy to see that it's Colita, that you're still fine”

He looked directly at me, speaking with confidence.

I felt like if Jason wasn't around Matt so much, he might even be a nice guy.

But then why did he have to go around spreading the whole thing about me being an angel.

“If you're trying to insult me more, it's not going to work” I said, “I'm bulletproof, I've got nothing to lose, fire away and fire away at me”

“It's true” he said, “I'm telling the truth” Nathan was standing behind him and even looked surprised, like it was a really big deal.

“It was just a joke about you being an angel” he said, “I never meant it, I made it up but I never expected people to believe it”

Tears were strreanming down my eyes, “So everything I went through, the long nights where I coudln't sleep because there were too many tears in my eyes, the times when I was so sad I couldn't smile anymore, and losin my closest friends. That was all because of your flirting?”

“I'm sorry” he said, “I never knew you felt so strongly about it, you never said anything so...”

If I never said anything, it meant that it had never happened. Because others weren't capable of seeing how you felt. It was a sick prank, that his rumour he said as a joke had actually torn my life apart.

“I'm sorry” Jason said.	

People apologized about everything with those words, the nuclear bombs, the disppearance of angels, and something small like dropping a friends' pencil. 

“But you like me don't you” he said. “You kissed me back and enjoyed it”

“That was when school first started” I covered my mouth in embarrassment, I saw Nathan and Matt were both watching.

I hadn't done anythign with Nathan, he must have felt weird about it.

I had had sex with Matt, and he must have felt that it was all ridiculous.

“Don't get the wrong idea, I wasn't serious” Had Jason been thinking about that kiss the whole time? It had meant nothing to me, but to him it had been so important. Through everything that happened, he had it stuck on his mind.

Had I been stringing him along without knowing it?

And had Jason been acting the whole time in front of Matt? He was tough in front of Matt, but was actually totally in love with me.

Matt walked away, disinterested, the beast had been with me, he had done me, I wasn't valuable to him anymore.

Nathan stared at me so hard, he was probably wishing I would reject Jason. 

Jason was firm with resolve. His arms were crossed, his knees were ready, like a goalkeeper not letting anyone past.

“You kissed him as well?” Nathan said, “Everyone but me” 

I understood now, I was afraid, I was afraid of commitment, so I let Matt touch me, but not Nathan, Nathan was too serious, he was too kind to let him touch me. 

But even now, he was still upset by it. “You won't let me touch you, but everyone else is allowed to,” 

“I can't let you touch me because I care about you.” He was the only one who I still had privacy with, I  still had respect around him, and I didn't want to lose that. “Sorry to be so selfish” I said, “It's just one of the few things I want to have left, but it's because I like you a lot. You're special.”

“That sucks” he said, “I'm special to you so I can't get with you. Don't you know that you're also special to me? I want to be with you.”

“I understand” he said, “And I respect you for that"

“What is between you two?” Jason said. “You're talking like you're best friends”

“I was friend-zoned” Nathan said, “I want to get out”
 

There was a normal girl at school, I didn't know her name, but she was usually quiet. She always dressed carefully, her uniform never had a crease in it, and her earrings were showing. Her hair was wrapped like a secret garden. I shared drama class with her one time, and we had to rehearse stuff.

Then she started talking to me so quickly. I was surprised because I had never really heard her talk, but she wanted to speak to me “urgently” and because it was something “actually important”

“You're Nathan's friend right? Can you get him to call me? Or talk to me? It should be easy for you, you're always with him. I've exhausted my options but still want to get with him, I wouldn't ask you if I knew a way not to go through you. I mean it's weird, me asking his best friend.”

“Best friend?”

“You two aren't dating right? So you must be good friends”

I had never thought of him as a good friend, just as someone who was always there.

I had always thought this girl was boring, she was just another quiet girl who studied hard and lived her own life, but then one moment she went from saying really boring slow things, to in the next moment she said something super intuitive and insightful comments. I didn't know what the reality was. 

Matt and Nathan and Jason were the same, they were dudes who acted like idiots who could only see sex and they said the stupidest jokes most of the time. A lot of girls thought they were too much and so competitive and stupid. 

But then the next moment in the middle of a dull conversation they said something amazing and really touching, and it drove the girls crazy in love.

She told me how she fell for Nathan, because I asked.

“I fell in love because just one time, he said something and it echoed to the depths of me” she said, “I'd never felt that way before from anyone, not from what my Mum, or my Dad, or anyone I knew said. And then the moment passed, and I never ever saw him serious again. But the result of it, my crush for him hasn't died away. That's why I watch him all the time and try to catch every sight of him, because maybe one time, for a fraction of a second that serious side of him might come back out again, and then I can see that and see him again. Then I can judge him fairly, judge the reason why I fell in love with him

“Judge a reason,....that is profound” She felt more beautiful than I did. A woman who had fallen in love without any control over it. She deserved Nathan more than I did.

She only had eyes for him.

But he only had eyes for me.

The result was a pointless endless struggle.

“People are usually just normal people, but sometimes there's something about them that's impressive, and you feel like you really know the person and understand them. And I hope to see Nathan in that moment again, and then I can properly judge him for who he is, and then I can know if I really like him or not.” she said. “Sometimes I start to forget why I like Nathan, why can't I like any other guy? And then I remember what I saw that time, and I try to find more of it again, then I might fall in love with him even harder, it's scary, but that's what my life is dedicated to, that's my passion”

### Chapter Sixty Three

```
I'm not going to put much here, only the chapter note, which I found randomly from inside a hat:

For a long time Nathan has been figuring out that Colita is his mother, they are slowly growing closer to this truth, she knows he is starting to figure it out, but they both fail to tell each other the truth.

By not saying it, it might remain true.

I guess I could reveal that, because it's not that important compared to the story, and if I reveal it, you might keep reading, for the fun of it hehe.

Thanks,

your author.

Here's how it goes:
```

We learned about genetics in science class last week, now we were learning about DNA. Since everyone knew I was an angel, I got a lot of stares and laughs.

“So, a female has two X chromosomes, and a male has an X and a Y chromosome. That's why men are better, because they have the best of both rules” The teacher said.

Then a female student raised her hand, “Well I thought in life we should all be focused, strictly on the task at hand, so then having two X chromosomes means you're more focused right?”

The teacher stroked his long silky smooth white beard. “Ah yes, I guess so, I never thought of that before”

“Please think of it teacher” the student said.

“Ah yes I will. Anyway,” he held up his hand, his robe hung loose and we could see all the way up his sleeve to his armpit.

Ewwwwwsies

The teacher hadn't lived in this country for long and didn't know what was okay and not okay. But showing his hairy unshaven armpits to us was definitely not on the okays idea of things.

Then the teacher brought out long slips, “We're going to be doing DNA tests this class” he said.

“What?” the class sighed, “What for? It's not like we're ever going to need that in our life”

The teacher looked down, he was reading something, a script. “It says I should give you the DNA test, it's necessary to move the story along. I don't know how, but it says it here.


We all took the DNA test, and then it turned out, oh so surprising and unbelievably, so astonishingly, that my DNA was exactly the same as surprise surprise!!! Nathan's. 

The girls shrugged, “Angels probably just don't have DNA in the first place”

“But she just drew blood, she has blood”

“It's not blood we're looking for, it's small things in the blood called DNA, it's what makes you a human”

“No, my Mum has blood, and she isn't human, she's scary”

“She wasn't scary when I was with her last night”

The conversation was out of control.

“Girls, DNA is in the blood, and since it's the same, Colita doesn't have any”

“But maybe it's Nathan who doesn't have any”

Wow, this was confusing, even I was confused.

“It's like they're siblings”
 
Then I realized that Nathan was my son. For the past five minutes, or thirty seconds, or however long it had taken, I saw that Nathan was staring at me, confused. He had no idea why our DNA had come out the same.


The teacher grinned and looked at his script, “This is genious” he said, “It really is interesting”

Nathan and I were both watching each other silently, my lips changed from something beautiful to something else frequently. He couldn't possibly know what it was that made us the same. I was safe. I wanted to tell him, but I couldn't.


Because I loved him, not in a maternal way, but in a romantic way.

When we left class everyone had already moved on and the topic had twisted to something else. I waited outside the classroom for Nathan, but he came out last, and walked straight past me. I know he saw me, because I had my beg out, and my skirt extra high to garner attention. 

When I wore my skirt long, about 20% of boys looked, when I moved it a few inches up, 35% of boys looked. And when I moved it above my knees, above my thighs, 50% of guys looked.
And when I rolled it up even more, all the guys looked, 100%  of them coudln't resist looking at my juicy legs. That's why I was so sure that Nathan would stop and look, and when he did, I could guilt him about watching me and then talk to him about something, anything. Then eventually I could lead the conversation to be about her.

But although all the guy saw my legs, Nathan walked on. It was effective to every guy but him. So I changed tactics, when he walked past the corridor I stood at the next one with my first button unzipped. 

25% of the guys walking past couldn't help looking at my legs, and then my chest.


Then I undid the next button, the top of my bra was showing. I also let my hair loose as well, to trail over my shirt, and come in loose strands.


85% of the guys looked, the only guys who walked past and didn't look at my legs and chest and hair were the homosexual guys who were running in a different competition.

I felt like a winner, but Nathan walked past me, he didn't look at my legs, or my chest, or my hair strutting out, he looked at every other girl and smiled at them, just like Mozart when he made his transitions, in symphony 49 he chromatically used every single note except the one note he was going to transition to. Nathan was headed straight for his bus. I knew it was at the far end of school and I ran ahead and ducked behind the tables.

I took my shirt off and my shoes off, then I lay on the ground, with my foot raised, so he could see my panties, and see my bra, and my hair. Then I made sure to gaze at him with a nice seductive look. That would get him to stop, surely!

Every single person who walked past was captured by me, guys walked past, the corridor T junction in the distance, then they came back and I saw them peering over at me. It was probably their first chance at seeing a turly hot girl throwing everything.

Then Nathan came along, I heard his shoes against the tiles. But he just walked straight past, he saw me but didn't give me a second glance, just like I was a couch or sofa or something, he didn't care if I was there or not.

I couldn't believe it, it was working on 100% of guys except Nathan. What was wrong with him? Why didn't he look?

I put my shoes on and ran outside, the long way around, to the quiet area around where his bus was. I kenw his bus was a small one that only took a few students to the smaller compounds where a few students lived.

Then I took it all off, literally everything, and I didn't even strike up a pose, I stood there with myself bare naked, my pubes and holes, and curves all showing. My nipples stood up in the cold. But I leaned against the wall, waiting for him.

I don't know what I was thinking, but when he talked to me, I would be able to talk to him, and we could finally discuss everything, even what was just happening in science class. I was so desperate that I would be happy with just a glance from him now.

Nathan came down the corridor, then he saw me all naked. He was alone, and only going home. But he saw me and didn't even glance twice.

Nathan, I'm your mother 

I wanted to say that, but he had already gone. Two minutes later the bus left and I was dressed up again. 

What had I just done? I was shameless. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Is that why you were late?” Lacey said, she was sitting cross legged at the bar. “Because you were chasing after Nathan?”

To hear Lacey talking to me was a relief, she really heard what I said. It meant that I really existed here, it wasn't my imagination, because everyone was talking to me. After being ignored by Nathan I had become nervous.

“You're obviously in love with him” she said. “That's why you were shameless, you were so desperate, I kind of admire you actually, I wish I was so singlemindedly in love like you sometime”

“I just wanted to talk to him”

“So you stripped down naked for him in the middle of school? I'm surprised you didn't catch a cold...” she rolled her eyes as she thought of a joke, “Or catch a penis...”

“That's got nothing to do with it”

“Look, do you know what he was thinking? The first time he walked past was answer enough, but you went and stripped down more, becoming more desperate, going the extra mile, using all of your persistence and effort, you stripped yourself down to less and less clothing. The second time he saw you he was probably like, 'she's weird, and so desperate' but you didn't stop there, you went and humiliated yourslef in front of him not once more, but twice more, and getting completely naked as well. I almost feel sorry for him, what was he supposed to do with seeing you stalking him like that?”

When she said it like that, I felt so embarrassed, seriously, what had I done?

“And you got naked” she said, “Now you've got nothing to keep him excited, a girl is only as valuable as the wrapping that is around her. If you show a guy everything, there is nothing left to keep him coming.”

I couldn't tell Lacey that Nathan was mine, Literally my property,he was my baby boy. I wasn't romantically in love with him. I was unconditionally in love with him.

“I think he likes you” Lacey said, “In general, but I can't tell you what it is, anymore, he seems like a really nice guy.”

If Nathan cared for me more than anyone else, it was because he was imprinted to me through classical conditioning. I had a baby seventeen years ago, when I was sixteen. That baby was called Nathan, he was my son and I never knew it. 

And henever knew it either, but we both turned up at the same school and developed a strong attraction for each other. 

I think that was what they called fate.

Lacey suddenly looked around like a sparrow, then stood up and went to the bathroom, slinging her furry bag like it was a testicle wrapped around her arm and flopping up and down. She punched through the doors, the doors swung around her like vibrating radio waves.

Then as I sat there, two other girls came over, one girl asked, “Can we use this chair?”

I said no because I was waiting for a friend, but they didn't hear me and took it. “Thanks”

They started talking loudly “I was so tired back there”

They were talking lik ebest friends who updated each other all the time.

“Did you want to stop and rest? I thought you did, that's why I stopped for you. But then you walked straight past, and you asked me why I was stopping”

"Oh right, women are different from men, I would usually stop for my guy friends, but I shouldn't have stopped with you, because you're my girl friend."

“Umm....are you okay?” The other girl said, she took the drink the bartender offered her and pinched her dress further down her legs.


Lacey still hadn't returned, 

The same girl was talking, it was like she was a dreamy person and had all sorts of cadence things to say. The other girl listened patinetly, but she was also curious. She was quiet, but both the speaking girl, and me could tell that she loved it.

"What is a woman's heart? It's a needle in the ocean. Do you understand?"

"Right... so it's the same size as love, it's the same rarity." The other girl said. “I'm a woman, so I should know”

Then Lacey came back, she was apologetic for taking so long, her testicle bag had moved hands, her wrists looked smoother, and her face was carefully made.

As we walked back we had nothing much to talk about, but I think Lacey was just glad to have me there, that was probably all she needed.

Then we walked past the street I went to school on, and we ran into Joyce, Jason's sister. She was always walking down this street, and she was always wearing purple clothes. I had only ever seen her on this street in purple clothes.

As far as I knew, Joyce didn't have any other life.

Lacey said goodbye to me before Joyce saw us. 

“I'm not a fan of her” she said, “I'm going to shoot off okay? I had great fun tonight”

I smiled and greeted her.

Lacey was so afraid of being seen, but there was no fear of that with me, Joyce walked past, she was humming a tune to herself, in a language I didn't understand. But she was so absorbed in it that she didn't see me. And it made me envious, because I wished I could just listen to music like she was and do the same as her.	

She was singing really loud.


Jay Chou: An Jing 

Only the piano was left to play with me all day, the cello was asleep.

She learned Chinese only for this song.

While Joyce walked past singing in Chinese, I felt inspired and started speaking in my own language. If I could speak so freely, then why hadn't I done so earlier.

I let it flow like prose, like a free poem, only to the rhythm of my steps, only to the rhythm of my sadness.


“I let Julia die. Julia always bragged to me "I'm not afraid of death, so you'd better heal me" I said.
"Wait, isn't that why I shouldn't?" I said
"Don't joke about this stuff" I said.
“I remembered that Julia said "Let the dead Julia worry about that" And now I still wonder what Julia will say next. What if she could still speak, what would she say now? I also wonder what would happen if I begged Max to bring Julia back, I know that with his power it still wasn't too late, then she can tell me what is wrong with me, what is it that I have to fix? If she just tells me then I am sure I can become a betetr more satisfied person, and content for the first time since I was born.”

I looked at the sky and spoke up, now I was sure someone was listening, and I was sure they understood me and felt the same way.

“I am insecure and desperate to change myself, and maybe if Julia comes, she can help me with that. And I also won't feel like it is my fault anymore, shouldering this much grief is heavy. So if you can just grant me this one thing, I am bound to change for the better. Bringing Julia back is the last solution, that's all that can help me anymore. Things were perfect when she was here.

So please”

I came back to my house and walked in.

So, I think this chapter is going to be kind of fun. So let's get going. That's only if you enjoyed the last chapter. Hehe, tired....hehe.

As always, thanks
your author

I got home and turned on some music, I opened a draw and scrolled through all sorts of records and CD's. I settled on a slow moving contemporary classical piece. It was called Tabula Rasa II Silentium, by Arvo Part, an Estonian Composer. 

After I listened to it for ten minutes tears were streaming down my eyes. These were simple tears or realization. I think there are many different types of tears, humans can only do so much to express themselves. 

I realized what the sound I was always hearing was, when things became too quiet I always heard a quiet sound, sometimes in the classroom when we were supposed to be quiet, so talking to people relieved that, and so did listening to loud music.

But now I knew what it was, it sounded like this music I was listening to now. The sound was so similar. It was the sound of the figure of death following me. 

It was constantly following me. I wanted to pray about it and say I am fine. But she knows that death won't let that happen, it will follow. Besides, praying required silence, and silence is rare. It was patiently waiting for me to expire.

The next day at school I felt powerless and weak. I thought that maybe as an angel I was safe from death, but now that I had lost my necklace, did it mean tha I was a human? Was this sound something that humans heard all the time, the silent pacing of time.

I saw Matt, after having sex with me, Matt had changed. He was always extremely arrogant and talked derogatively to women and girls around him. He always said jokes he thought were funny, like about vagina's and breasts and rape. Women around him were always offended. Julia even told me this, she was repeating what Colessa said to her.

Those two names brought tears to my eyes, different tears again. Matt was always a lot of things, but he had been curious about me, now he wasn't curious, I was no mystery. I was just an enemy.

Lacey came and talked to me, then I said what I thought I heard. 

“What? Colita, that's weird”

“No, I'm really afraid of getting older” I said.

“I'm not afraid of death” she said

I had never expected something so profound to come out of her mouth. “That was really interesting” I said.

“Don't judge me based on what I say, and if it is acceptable to you or not” she said. “You mean to say that everything I've said until now was boring to you?”

“No, not in that way, don't take it that way”

“A lot of the time” she said, Lacey said, “I feel that I'm just packaging around my genitalia. I'm made to look pretty because the better the package is presented with paper and ribbons, the more the inner contents are valued.”

Wow, she was just....wow.

She smiled at me, “I'm happy to share this with you” she said, “So don't become too shallow of a person”

“What? I'm shallow?” She didn't say it, but she didn't need to. I saw what she saw in me was what I usually saw in her. I always thought she was more shallow than me, but she also thought the same about me.

I realized that up until now Lacey had been a relatively unimportant person in my life, but with these few words she had become a key presence in my life moving it. 

“Okay, I'm going to go and print something” she said.

“Okay see you later.” I said. “Wait” I called out. Lacey turned her head at me and smiled. 

“What is it?”

“Is this for English?”

“Yes, I'm printing it out now”

I read mine in front of the class but it was boring, no one said much about it. But when Lacey read hers, everyone praised her. 

I think she was talented at writing, I had never known she had so much potential. And it had taken me this long to find it in her.

I felt like I had no talents compared to her.

When she read her story, her voice was solemn, like a bell of wishfulness.

“He said:
I'll commit suicide before ever hurting a human, don't worry, I'll say bye to you guys first, come on! I'm not just going to jump out of nowhere, I'll say bye first.
Jason was welcoming death with open arms, but he was secretly hiding a knife in his hands. It was because Jason wanted to protect Matt, so he was trying to kill Death.”

Lavcey paused for a second and went on, I saw her lips move, her breath, and the whole class tensed up for what was coming. She was using Matt and Jason's names. I was kind of upset my own name wasn't in here, I really wanted to be in it. Lacey was so beautiful while reading this. I had never felt so amazed by her before. And now I was starting to think that maybe Julia, maybe, she was replaceable....

It was a bad thought, but it seemed that way. Was this healing?

“Then Matt won't die if Jason is able to protect him, and it almost works, Jason tried to stab, but he missed, and then he became really afraid, because if it worked it meant that no one would happen anymore. Nothing would ever change anymore.”

The idea was really original, Lacey was destined to be a great person at something.

“Jason only got the idea of it from Nathan who promised to do the same for Colita. But when he saw death, he didn't do it, he knew there was no chance in human pride. This figure in front of him was out of his league. He had always imagined a scary figure and prepared for it, but in reality death was a noble gentleman with a keen sense of humor.
 
Death instantly knew Jason's intentions. fights back and takes Matt as well, and promises to punish Jason for his arrogance and ignorance. Even though Jason, in his own way, was just vowing to protect Matt. If Nathan had done the same, he would have been sent to the same punishment, so Nathan sighed in mixed feelings.

There is a long history of dislike between angels and Death, because angels reverse the process of death, make his job harder, he has to travel and pay more fees for transport, only to have to go back home again. No serious death worker likes angels.”


Lacey finished and sighed, like some deep part of her was finally leaving. “I really wish you'd talk to me more” she said.

I was brought to tears, it felt like she was talking about me. I never kenw that she had thought so much about it, that she had such a sharp vision of my life, I thought she had never cared much about others, but how wrong I had been.

Lacey later said she was inspired by Medea, from the Greek Theology. But her story was nothing like it, it was original, it spat of authenticity.


And I was inspired by Lacey. 

And the cycle went on.

### Chapter Sixty Five - Colita the Heroine

This wasn't the first chat with Max, but I felt like it might be turning into the last. After Max came, each time I talked to him I felt more growth had happened between us, like a plant trying to survive in between two rocks, each time I saw it, it had grown a little bigger and a little thicker, and it was pushing the rocks away from each other.

There was a growth between us. It had become so big that the two rocks had completely rolled over out of side.


“Let's talk about how to deal with global issues” Max said, “I haven't taught you that yet. Angel Corp is supposed to take care of the world.”

I stopped him there, I had only stopped him a few times in his life, “I'm not able to do that” I couldn't tell anyone, literally anyone about it. Max right now wouldn't understand, and I was pretty sure he never would be able to. It was founded on a principle to bring about peace to the world, ever since Angel corp was formed there were less wars and less violence, but did that really change the way things work in the world? 

I couldn't even tell a single person my morals and purpose in life. What I really believed.

After thirty three years of living, it took me this long to find out that there are some things in life that you do deliberately, with good intentions. But it turns out to hurt them or somehow makes them upset. And on the other side were the things I did without caring about them. But it turned out to be some of the best work I ever did.
 
Then sometimes I set out to do what was good over what was the popular choice and everyone became upset by it because it wasn't what they wanted. But everyone knew it was the right decision. 

Sometimes I tried to do something for someone, then everyone else became angry. And the person never thanked me in the end. 

And then there were the things that I didn't do deliberately. Those were the things I never realize I had done.

So who knew what the right thing to do was.


Max never got angry at me for things. I always knew he gave me special treatment for some reason, but I couldn't figure out that reason.

Max was like that, he never got mad at me for things. No one did really, I saw people around me yelling at each other and gettign furstrated, but no one got angry at me. It was probably because I was so boring and not worth getting frustrated over. Probably because I also wasn't human.

Even Julia, who had never met Max, heard my stories about him and had her own opinion.

“He must be attracted to you as well” she said. “Everyone around you is, you seem to pull everyone's attention.” I remember her laughing, “Those around you are the loneliest and sucked dry, it's almost cruel”

“That's just now” I said, “You seem him at his best, he's not always like that. He actually doesn't understand me at all, not even 2% of me, he just uses me as a mirror, someone to talk to and reflect his words onto. If he could find another mirror somewhere else, he would leave me and go to it immediately. He only feels something every now and then, a grooming need to express it to anyone he sees. But that;s just sometimes, most of the time he doesn't feel anything. He's just a quiet boring possessor of a penis”

Matt was lying in bed, injured for something else that had happened. Apparently he had sprained his ankle while he was running other errands.

I had to walk past him to get to Max, then Matt waved me down.

“Did you go to the funeral?” he said. “Was it solemn?”

“Solemn? Why?”

“That guy I shot”

“He's still alive” I said.

“Oh, thank goodness, I thought my life had changed from this day forth. I killed someone and wasn't punished for it. So where is he recovering?”

“Right next to you” I said, and closed his curtain and went to Max's.

I told Max what was on my mind, he was lying and staring into the sun, I walked in and started talking, not caring what he thought, not carign if he wanted to listen or not, I just talked and talked like a dog at night.

“Max, I realized I don't have anything to miss anymore. I used to miss talking to humans, and I used to enjoy living life, but now I don't miss anything anymore. It's like I'm depressed or something. I know I'm in no position to complain, I'm really very fortunate and all, but...
“SO WHAT?” Max said, “I've been living like that for the past twenty years, nothing to miss, nothing to get me excited. A still lake without waves. A bridge crossing over a dried up stream. Your life only comes through in waves, delayed reactions of years ago. Small fragments of what you are supposed to feel. It's like being numb, unmoveable by emotions, just stone cold.”

Then I suddenly loved him so much more.

“It's like a stirring pot” he said, “when you stir it, all the colours and things are unevenly distributed, and moving and mixing.

“But then as soon as you stop, it starts to slow down and slowly becomes a dark grey mush. And then it just sits there, while the top layer is still mixing. But then the stuff at the bottom is heavy and motionless, and just drowsy.”

“Wow” I said, “I completely understand what you mean”

“What you're worried about, what's making you stressed” he said, “I already thought about it before, and I'm tired of thinking about it.”


“I think I feel that way as well” she said, “Not because I'm an angel”

“What's it got to do with being an angel?”

“It doesn't, that's what I'm saying, I think it's because I let my friend go, and I'm still feeling guilty from it. I never used to feel this way, only recently it's coming back stronger and stronger.”

“Who knows” Max said, “Your life is not yours to decide, it could be a deep guilt that has sunken down and not mixed with anything, or else it could just be out of own decision. Who knows”


That only made me feel more guilty. I used to be fine doing whatever actions and lying and cheating and being promiscuous. But now I was feeling so bad by it.

### Chapter Sixty Five - Colita the Replacement

I heard that there was a lady who always came to talk to little girls about things that were happening. She wanted them to do things. I overheard one of the parents talking about it. They were on their way to school with their daughters, and I was walking behind them on my way to the High school. I had a bar of chocolate in my bag to give to Max. Since he had been in the nursing room the whole time.

But on the way I went to a Church, I slipped in quietly, and relaxed. Inside was a small girl with many belongings. She was praying to God quietly and whispering something about her life.

Then as I was watching, a woman moved behind a pillar and went up to the girl. 

Then I recognized her as Julia's Mom. She was creeping up to the little girl, holding a lollipop in her hand, and wearing some old business shoes.


“Do you want a lolly?” she said. The little girl spun around, screamed, and ran like the wind.

“Julia's Mum” I said, she looked to me, confused. Finally she put her lollipops away and a twisted recognition returned to her face.

“You're Julia's friend, Colita, am I right?”

I nodded, smiling. It was good to see her again.

“Now tell me” she sat me down outside the Church, on a bench in a field of grass. “I'm always concerned about this but I can't ask her directly, because you know how girls are, so I will ask you, and can you tell me truthfully. Is Julia taking drugs? Does she drink alcohol when she's with you?”

“It's something bigger” I said, “It's suicide, that's her issue”

“I understand” she said, “But is she doing drugs? Is my lovely daughter on dope? Because if she is, then you're a bad influence.”

To Julia's Mom, Julia had come back to life and was living normally, at her home she even called her down for dinner and put Julia's portion on a plate. At the end of dinner she took the plate and emptied it in the bin, humming to herself.

“I've recently been doing something very strange” she said, “I'm sure you've heard of it”


I nodded, “What is it, can you tell me?”

She rubbed her wrinkled eyes, her nose was an ugly thing, and her cheeks were no longer rosy.

“I see young girls outside and invite them home to have dinner with me and talk. Just talk, just casually. But other parents began to see me as a threat. Some even said it was harassment. I'm only trying to do good for these girls, but protective parents see me as a creep and weird and annoying and creepy.”

I wondered what would happen if I shape shifted to become Julia. I would look exactly and sound like her. Then would I be able to replace Julia completely? And I would be able to stop a lot of pain in the world.

But I wasn't so sure, what if doing that just made others angry and upset at me for whatever reason. You never knew how it would be received.

Julia's Mom kept talking, now we were at her house. I hadn't been here since I had been with Julia. But the more Julia's Mom talked, the more I felt lonely. I was a grown woman, I was supposed to be mature and confident and have my way in life set, but it wasn't like that. I listened and heard, and wanted a family, a real human family that sat together for dinner and enjoyed themselves, really cared for each other. But I knew I would never be invited in.


“But I'm a nice girl right?” I said.

“I'm sorry” she said, “I don't remember any friend of Julia's called Colita.”

Huh? Just now she said she knew me, and now she was pretending like she didn't again. Was it her self defence? She was blocking out all past memories related to Julia, so she could live in relative peace.

### Chapter Sixty Six - Colita the Girlfriend

Next time I went to see Max, he was afraid of me. He must have heard something about me that had suddenly scared him.

Max was afraid of me for the first time, to him I had become like a monster. Insecurity was turning me inside out and made me something scary and desperate and blind.

When we had been going out, we were arguing everywhere,"Lets do this" he said.

"No"


Max was confused as to what women wanted, what was in their heart?

The last time a man ever saw a woman's heart was back in 1967, and it was only so briefly that it didn't really change anything about the big problem of men and women.

So I gave him the spiel, "I'm just a person who was never meant to be equal, everyone's different, everyone serves society and has a different role that they repeatedly find themselves filling. And my role in life is to be unequal, it's just as simple as that. Some people need to be unequal, some people need be treated extremely well. That makes the world more balanced. Some people are meant to live a long time, some people are meant to die early. If everything is the same, then there is no change."

Max arrived late, but he still arrived, and it was to say bye. He learnt I was pregnant and had now started running.

He was getting on a train, “I'm sorry, but I have my life to live” he said, “I have passions, so forgive me, but one day I'll come back and give our son the most love possible for an angel to have.”

It wasn't much.

“But Colita” he said, squeezing my cheeks like I was his toy, I had to listen to him, even when he was leaving he had to make himself look better than me. “You always say you want to settle down, you're sick of change, or balance, you want difference, because it's not boring.”

“But Colita, aren't you the one, more than anyone else, to be longing for change?” 

I remember that struck a chord with me. And it hurt to have someone so irresponsible, so uncaring to be able to know so much about me. I didn't want that.

I left the nurse room and Max asleep. Then went to lunch. Afterwards, the guys were hanging around the rooms. Jason talke dto every girl the same, he said the same flirty lines to Lacey that he said to me, and probably to countless other girls. He only had a few phrases in his vocabulary which he repeated for different circumstances. He didn't even bother changing his intonation or tone.

“Kiss me Colita” he said, “Liked you kissed Matt” He followed me to class and came up to me when there was no one around. “Before you leave, come on, you're leaving anyway right? So kiss me.”

That was exactly why I didn't want to kiss him. Because it was an attachment that would only cause more pain after it was broken.

He caught me under the stairs, under the stars. So I relented to his persistence and gave him them, a pair of two kisses quickly cushioned his lips.

I was kissing so many boys.

Jason took the opportunity and grabbed my hair, then he pulled me in and kissed me frantically, our jaws were massaging each other, if anyone saw us they would be envious. There was much passion.

“You're a pervert, a huge pervert” he said, “I'm going to treat you right and give you what you deserve. You're cheating on me with Matt and Nathan, you dirty girl.”

I relented even more, diving onto him. I didn't care anymore, I just wanted to forget everything, who I was, and who I was trying not to be. I didn't want to wake up from this and walk back home alone.

In a break, my top button had come off, Jason was touching my breasts with his hand, kneading them in circles, he touched my nipple and steam came through the shirt. 

“Ahh, not so much” I said, “The smoke alarm might go off”

He laughed, “You're always so funny, you...” he was kissing me again. 

“Is Matt going to be upset?” I said, “When he finds out”

“We're good friends” he said, “Even if he sees me, and you in the car, we will never tell each other, our friendship would be destroyed. We won't lose ourselves over a woman. We can do anything, but we can't lose respect for each other, just because of a girl.”

“I'm a girl” I said, “I'm something amazing”

“Shh” he moved my hair out of the way and kissed me again. I felt the heat of his breath flow into me and make me float.

“How about you experiment” I said, pushing him away.

“Experiment?” he kissed my neck.

“Kiss Nathan” I said.

“What?” Nathan was standing in the doorway, “I heard everything” he said, “I will kiss you Jason” (Make it all look so weird and coincidental and unrealistic, to such a strong extent, designed cheaply, for pure convenience)

Then Nathan came over, and right in front of me, while Jason still had his hand on my breast, and his fingers were still playing with my nipple, the two guys kissed.

Nathan came away shocked. But then he asked for more. He touched his lips, "This is what girls get to have all the time" My nipple twitched in excitement.

Jason kissed and put both hands under my shirt, grabbing my nipples and pulling them like rubber bands. I screamed in pleasure. My uniform was still on, everything still looked normal. But I knew that these boys would go mad over these round things I had. They both loved soccer and basketball, and round balls that are played with in general.

“Just for now” I moaned, “You can do anything you want with me”

"I won't talk about what's most important to me, it's a disaster." Nathan said. He grabbed my pants and slowly slid them off. He had a rocket ready to blast straight to the moon.

I wanted him to blast me. Destroy my insides. Paint me with his seed.

“You're so perverted Colita” Jason said, he was kissing my body like a machine, everywhere. I bit my finger to try and control the tension, I was going to cum so early. That wasn't enough to enjoy it.

“We're at school” Nathan said, he was excited, this was probably something he had never done. “Right under the stairs, anyone can see us”

He slid my pants off my ankles and laid me down on the floor, Jason stood up and unzipped himself, he let his device out. 

“Beg for it” his eyes were two stars.


I widened my legs instinctively. Nathan set me on the floor gently before Jason dived into me. And the feast started.

Jason said in between breaths, “I can't...believe....ahhhhhh.....such a normal girl like you....is so perverted inside.....we can't satisfy you at all”

“You just want more and more” Nathan had his fingers in me and was playing with an oyster. If he moved too much, I would catch his fingers and never let them go.

My bum was on the cold tiles, but these boys were sizzling with heat. It was like a heater in the middle of winter.


"Colita, you deserve to be in this world just as much as anyone else here does. You're not lower, you're just as good as them. So you don't need to prove to us that you are, we know you are. But that also means that others deserve to be here as well. Because you have developed your talents doesn't mean you can overshadow others."


“I know” I said, “So don't stop, keep going lion”

If I stopped moving. Then the figure that Jason ran into and messed things up would catch up to me as well, so I has to keep moving, keep living, keep cursing, as much as possible.

Then I opened my eyes and shrank bank in fear, instead of Jason or Nathan, I saw a massive grim reaper, with a golden sickle sliding in and out of me, like it didn't matter at all. It's voice was so deep that the earth trembled. The sickle moved into me, and then out, and the grim reaper breathed another breath, it sounded like an air conditioner or something.

"So you call this moving? Sucking off Matt and pleasuring others? What good are you doing in the world? How are you benefiting anyone by being alive? You might as well die, disappear, give up, stop trying."

“How did you know? Have you been snooping around about me? It's my business what I do, none of yours!”

Then the world fell silent. And Jason and Nathan were both collapsed next to me, Nathan's fluids were still leaking out in pumps. “Sorry” he wiped it off. “I didn;t want to go in you”

“We're having so much fun” I said, “Even when Julia isn't here, I feel so guilty about it”

We had a few minutes until end of school, all the classes had been skipped. The floor was sticky from a mixture of our chemistry.
 
Nathan slid around on the floor and brought out a small speaker and linked it to his iPod.


Afterwards, all of us listened to a song, Jason said it was one of his favourites. And today was a good day, so he would share it with us.
 
If our love is a tragedy, why are you my remedy.
If our love is insanity, why are you my clarity.

You are a piece of me I wish I didn't need,
Chasing relentlessly, seal fired and I don't know why

You pull and I push too deep

He just replayed the same part of it again and again.

“I'm so glad you came to our school” he said, “After I met you my life has really become better, it's like everything is so much more clear.”

“I have to tell you something” I said. “Actually, I've wanted to spit this into the open for a while now, but I liked Jason first when I came to this school, I just always liked him a lot. But then I followed Matt around all day”

“Why?”

“Because it was my job” I said.

“Oh, I thought you always liked Matt” Nathan flopped his tool back into its pocket and zipped up his jeans. I watched as the snake coiled back in, I could hardly take my eyes off it.

Nathan seemed cool about it. “So you liked Jason first, but liking someone is arbitrary, and it's not that important in the end. I still like you” Nathan said. “Remember? My feelings never change”

I could have thought that was creepy, or I could have laughed with it. But I was his mother, I had just slept with my son. That was a terrible thing to say. I couldn't stop staring at him, I liked him more and more. And surprisingly, I didn't even regret sleeping with him. I was even proud of it.

But what he said was true 'like' wasn't very different, it was really great.

Jason turned the song back on and we listened to it 

Until the last school bell rang.

Until the fast feelings disappeared, the surface dust was blown away, and the hard things beneath it remained.

Until the dullness returned.

### Chapter Sixty Seven

> BACKSTORY - COLITA THE LOYAL

---

Max came in, like off the helicopter, it was a repeat of something I saw so often. But he was still really losing everything around himself, his hair was muddled, and his shirt was checkered. He stood no chance against the human. He got the information wrong about an assassin going after the human, no one was. In reality they could all go home now.

The human and Matt had been at war for a long time. Long before I started dating Matt.

Now they had finally agreed to discuss it in a civilized manner, with no guns and no hatred. I let out a sigh of relief. Men hardly ever did this, they were such impulsive things. 

Max put his gun on the table with his left hand, then with his other hand he put his hatred on the table. It makes a crack in the table, but he laid it all out.
 
“That's all of it” he said. “That's all I have now, I'm empty, what do you want?” 

The human had nothing else to offer.

“I've given you everything” Max said. The two of them stood across from the table at each other. There was no hatred, and there was no sense of inequality.
“I'm all ears” the man said. “It must be nice for you to be the head of Angel.Corp, you're always surrounded by beautiful women, you must get a lot of action. ” The man was Max's enemy, “I only have my mother near me”

“That should be enough for you” Max said. “But poor you, if you had a penis you might get some action.”

The human thought long and hard, “Your face looks like a penis, that's why.” He tipped, “You're like a woodpecker, but with a cock for a beak. (Ridiculous sense of humour) 

“Eh penis head?” The human crossed his hands in competition.

“That's such a ridiculous thing to say, is that meant to be a diss?” Max said.

“You mad bro? You mad at that? You're sounding so mad right now.” The human said.


“I didn't choose to be mad, I was born to be mad”

“I have two conditions” the human said. “I demand you give me all of the angels as my pleasure girls. They will live in my house and be treated as good as human women are. Then, one by one, I will impregnate them and they will lay my babies. Otherwise I won't do it. 

“Are you sure?”

“Umm, let me think about it....yes. Why would I not take this ooportunity to have sex with beautiful women for the rest of my life?”

This human's mind changed and his demands changed on random whims. I was watching on the side as Max made the negotiations. I just hoped that I wouldn't have to be with this guy.

Then Max sunk down, deep in thought. When he finally stood up, the world had changed, the rebirth of the world had come and gone. 

“Okay” he said, “You can have all of my angels, as long as you promise to give me their babies, so we can repopulate the population.”

Max didn't last long, I took out a gun and shot him. A tunnel ran thorugh his head, and from the back of his head I could see the human peering through from the other side, until it was quickly swallowed by fresh blood. Max fell to the ground and hit a tile on the way down, it spun out of its groovings. 

So that was how the inside of Max was.

“I can't let you do that” I was already pregnant with his baby. No music at no volume would drown that out. The other angels looked at me,some were relieved, some were upset.

“It's for our race” they said, “He was going to save us all”

Then, it was a really weird time. While the angels rushed over to heal Max, I remember that a few of us angels sat around, it was a truce, and we played a human game called King game. But the game didn't last, and we started joking about stuff.


About the stuff an angel experienced of human life. Just random things that we trash talked. About women in general. 

“Do you remember the girl who was killed? Max did it by accident, do you think he might do it again?”

“Did you kill someone today?” 

Everyone burst out laughing. A moment ago it would have been inappropriate, but right now they were all saying it. It was so crude, like oil, and rude, but could only be said in this moment. 

They could joke about anything. It was so rude and bad.


“There's a girl who's crazy for me” the human said.

“She likes me” I said.

“Well, among humans I'm not that popular, and another guy was beating me up, she saw it and stopped the fight. That's when I started to like her, but she likes me because of what I said to her afterwards, not because of what he did to me”


I said, “Every woman only likes you because of that penis face you have, it's such a disgusting look, you're either up or you're down” I moved my hands. Guys only talked when there was something perverted to say. “And when it's up, they love you”

He responded, “Women love me because I'm a great guy to talk to, I think about their feelings and really try to appreciate what they have to say”

“Pride is such a personal thing, more personal than your face.” I said.

“Well, I bet you're used to it by now”


“No, it's my first time, my first time holding a gun, how does it feel to lose to that?” 

The human was really a powerful presence, but among his own kind he was just another person who was self obsessed.

It was better not to be equal than deal with this human. Colita agreed with Colessa, she hated humans, they could only accept their own kind and were too selfish. Rather than think about her race, she can only think of how she dislikes this human, and can't suffer right now to save the posterity that would come after her.

Why did the fate of angels have to rest in this person's arbitrary decisions?

### Chapter Sixty Eight - Colita the Broken

```
Sorry guys, it's been really random lately. It was so random because everyone there were so many things to put in, and I've got so many notes, but I don't really know where it's going. The idea is to have decentralization as we approach the end, and the whole story becomes more and more fluid and less composed. 

I think that is cool...

But it's also super super random.

So please stick along and let's travel with Colita!!!

Sincerely, author.

My Math teacher was upset at me. She made me stay behind after class.

“If you don't want to study, if you don't care about your grades, if you're not even trying, then why are you in school?”

Did she want the honest answer or the false answer, the long version or the short version?

I gave her my default answer, a short and quiet grunt that made me seem timid and sorry.

My math teacher's name was Mrs. Empathy, she stared at me without a trace of care and emotion, just an eternally dissatisfied snarl.

“I'm telling you this” she said, “Because I'm concerned for you, what are you going to do in the future”


She was obviously antisocial, everyone kenw I was an angel, and they stopped bothering with my school studies. Everyone asked me why I was still coming to school, when I wasn't even a high schooler.

But it was nice to have this from her. It made me feel proper. I had come straight from dealing with big angel issues to dealing and arguing about homework.

“I don't care what you're facing, you have to help me here, you have to do your homework on time, I'm sick of you handing it in late” Mrs. Empathy crossed her arms and legs.

“I'm sorry” I said, “My life has been a bit hectic”

“What's your excuse, you stayed up late doing Facebook with your friends? Please, this is about your future, you have to take care of it yourself, because nobody else can do it for you”

I wanted to cry. I saw a vase behind Mrs. Empathy's butt. It stood against the window, and I had seen it from outside many times before, but it was the first time I was noticing it from so close. From outside it was a perfect vase, always reflecting the sunlight completely honestly and changing it into something beautiful.


She was broken, but I couldn't heal her. That's what it reminded me of.

But from the inside, in the room, I saw a big crack running up the vase, it had been painted in, but of a slightly different colour. A vase that was broken would never be the same again, even if you got the strongest most natural looking glue in the world.

Mrs. Empathy growled, “What are you looking at?”

“There's a vase behind you” I pointed to it desperately. “Sorry to change the topic, but did you accidentally break it, and then it was so valuable, so you tried to fix it?”

“I tried?” The keyword was tried. As if she thought it was perfect.

“I bought it like that” she said. “I didn't want to buy something perfect and unblemished, that's like a baby's ideology. That vase used to be in my house, it used to be the most valuable vase in the world.” She spun around on her chair and picked it up. “Can you believe it? This thing here was the most beautiful vase in the world, but after it broke because one of the housemaids In the rich house dropped it, she lost her life and her family as well.”
 
“But you always lose your family together with your life.” I said.


“But the vase lost all of its value, it became just another piece of junk after the crack running through it, it became completely worthless. But then I was walking through markets and saw this vase, and I was mesmerized by it, I thought it was more beautiful because of the crack, and I haggled and bargained and got a good price for it. No one would have imagined that it was the most valuable vase in the world. When I came back and showed my friends, they said I had a wrong aesthetic of beauty, that I was finding beauty in the ugly, but I don't think so.” she shook her head.

Mrs. Empathy completely dropped the math, “On a deeper level” she said, “I think I see myself in the vase, the vase used to be someone so important, but now it's nothing. I sometimes feel like a nobody, no one important, I don't mean anything to anyone. All I am is a story told by some other unimportant people.”

Then she growled again, “Stop making me go off topic, seriously, you need to be doing your homework. Do you promise?”

“Okay, I promise” I said.

### Chapter Sixty Nine - Colita the Sister

On Friday night I followed Nathan home. I know I didn't need to, but I wanted to do it for old time's sake. And also because I was lonely. 

After about an hour, people started coming to their house. The house became full of people. The family was all here, I overheard one lady talking to another lady her age about another guy called George. I was on the grass outside and could hear everything.

“If he does anything, let me know, because I don't want to be wasting time with him either, and he has a bad history.” 

The other lady agreed with the bad history, “I haven't heard anything.” she said, “But 
I can feel this as well, I wouldn't want to get with someone if they had history of cheating. I would be so afraid that they would do it again. What if he was with someone else? I couldn't even begin to imagine the pain” she said.

Some kids came running out to the rescue, they were the young superheroes and fighting the bad, and the adults left the scene. It looked like a rare event for them, and a big family was here. And everyone knew each other reasonably well. 

Then I saw Nathan standing and talking to some people, he was well dressed and was handing everyone snacks to eat. He was smiling and polite, nothing like the Nathan I saw at school.

I felt a weird feeling welling up, I was happy to see him doing this for others, and like it was a good thing for me as well.

Was this me being proud? 

He was my son.


I stood up and flattened my skirt, then I went closer to the house slowly. Then walked in.

“Hey, and who would you be?” someone said.

I turned and saw a big man smiling with a drink in his hand. “Have you had something to eat yet? There's a lot there”

“I'm Nathan's sister” I said.

His mouth dropped, “He has a sister, wow, how come I never knew about this?”

“I don't come out often” I smiled, then I gapped it before he could ask me more. But as I walked around I started to realize that no one knew I was an outsider, to them I was just another person walking around and enjoying myself. I was another member of the family.


People greeted me warmly and talked to me normally.

A girl came up to me and offered me snacks. “Do you want?” she said.

I took one then put it back, “I would like one, but I don't think I should” Because I wasn't really part of this gathering, I didn't think it was fair to take their food.

“Is it because you don't want to be fat?” the little girl said, she held air in her cheeks and became grumpy, “Why won't you eat my snackkies”

“Don't force her Colita” Her mother came up behind and rubbed the girl's head. “This young lady said she didn't want one, so don't make her eat one okay?”

The girl pouted and turned to hug her mother. Her mother looked up to me with a kind smile, “Sorry, my little girl Colita is a really excited girl.”

She had the same name as me, this was the first girl I met with the same name as me.

“No worries” I smiled and tried to leave. It was too much to be here. Everyone was too kind to me, I was a fraud

“Which part of the family are you from? The Kagaya's, or the Van Workum's?”

“Neither” I smiled, “I'm just Nathan's sister”

I heard some guys talking, they were drinking beers, “I'm not always perverted, but it's because my sister is always masturbating shamelessly, she doesn't even lock her door anymore, I cant believe it, it's nasty.”

“What's wrong with her” another guy said, “Who does that, is that why she didn't come here today.”
“She's probably going hard at home.”

“I wanna go see it...” another guy said. “Your sister's kind of hot.”

“Get lost, you're not coming over to my place anymore. Anyway, I confronted her about it, I told her I was disgusted with her looseness, I can always smell her vaginal fluids on her hands, she washes them, but that smell doesn't come off. They're her fluids, no one else's. I know because I asked the doctor.” 

“What, you asked a doctor if your sister's smell was from her vagina? Maybe it was just canned tuna.” The guys started laughing

“Did he sniff it with his eyes closed? Like AHHHH”

“This is serious okay, the fluid doctor said...”

“Fluid doctor! HAHAHAHA” 


“It's true, they squeeze every lady who comes along until some juices leak, then they scientifically analyze the liquids”

“Ok, enough Lane, that's disgusting” one of the girls had joined in the conversation, she was sipping a lemonade with a straw. She looked like she knew the guys well/.

“It's funny, it's like they're looking at oranges....oh this one's a bit sour”

“Pussy juice lab, literally”  

“Enough!” the girl said.

When I walked past, I tried to be as quiet as I could, with my head down, but the guys stopped talking, and watched as I walked past.

“Who is she?” I heard them say.

Then I walked further and bumped into a snack box. It crumpled all over my shirt.

“Colita?” I looked up to see Nathan looking at me, concerned. “Are you alright, I'm so sorry, I didn't know you'd be here” (He doesn't ask what she is doing here, just directly sorry for running into her)

“No, I...”

He put the tray down and wiped the snacks off, there was cheesecake and other assortments

“You don't need to...I can do it myself”

“No, let me do it” he said. “It was partly my fault”

I felt bad to make him do this, I could feel the stares starting to arrive.

“If you want” Nathan said, “You can join in this party”

“No, it's okay, I was just passing through, thanks” I began to walk off.

“Wait, you can stay, let's chill a bit” he said. “I'll show you my family, you've never met them right?”

“No, it's okay” I broke away from his grip and returned. He didn't follow me, I didnt' want him to anyway. He should be there with his family. 

And when I was a safe distance away, I crouched down next to a tree and wiped my tears, it was too sad.

Don't need to be alone


Don't need to be alone

Take these broken wings and learn to fly, all your life you were only waiting for this moment to arrive.

You were only waiting for this moment to arrive

Because now I knew that he was better off there at home. He was my son, but being without me, he was living a better life than anything I could have ever given him. 

I wasn't a part of his family and it was better that way.

### Chapter Seventy - Colita the Honest

“Nobody feels any pain? Tonight as I stand inside the rain. Everybody knows, that baby's got new clothes, but lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her coats.”

“What is that it's weird”

“She takes just like a woman,
She makes love just like a woman,
And she aches just like a woman,
But she breaks just like a little girl”


“Oh, its a song, you know? I didn't mean it at all”


“Oh, okay”


“Okay as in Okay okay, or just okay”


“Uhh, both...I guess?”

“They're very different you know”

“That's okay, I don't want to know”

“Songs make things come alive, most of the time we arent' alive, so I think we should sing more when we are talking”


I stood outside the schoolgates, then Nathan walked past, he approached me the saem way. But I turned around and kind of shrugged him off. I guess I was shy, I wanted him to come up to me, but I didn't dare go to him.

“Colita” I heard him say my name and felt warm, “How come outside school you act so different towards me.”

I shrugged, ”Don't worry, I like you”

“Ever since people found out you were an angel, since Jason started spreading it, you've become so quiet all the time.” He came closer, and touched a strand of my hair, “What's going on in that little head of yours?”

I pushed him away instinctively. “Don't” If he came any closer, then I might really fall for him, I might not be able to ever come back.


“Tell me, when you're so quiet, what are you thinking about?” he said. “How come you were at my family gathering yesterday?”

“That's too many questions” I said, “I don't think about much, just boring stuff, and I can't tell you the answer why I was at your house”

“It's because you like me right?” he said.

“Yes” I said, but he didn't know exactly how much I liked him.

“And can I ask you something else? Why was your DNA the same as mine in science class?” he said, “Sorry to bombard you with so many questions suddenly, Im just curious, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.”

I shook my head, “I don't mind. Umm...I think it was because we are related.”

“We're related?” he thought about it, “But you're an angel right?”

the school gates were like spears shooting into the sky rimmed with gold blood on their tips. The gate swung open like a page to a book.

“Angels and humans aren't so different” I said. “And that's why I feel so upset when people treat us like we're so different, people treat me separately, even though I'm the same.”

“It's segregation” Nathan put his school bag down, it wasn't zipped up very well, and he put it against the gate and sat down. “Even among humans people treat each other differently, it's like we are all carrying knives, and we want to split everything up into eatable chunks. Then we can understand it.”

I was so happy to be able to talk to my son here. I was proud that he had grown to be such a smart person, and he was living a proper life, integrated with everyone. As a mother I couldn't wish for anything more from a son.

“You know, you always amaze me with the things you say, I learn so much from you.”

“You do?” I said. “Why?”

“Just that cluelessness of yours, you don't even realize it yourself, but I'm just fascinated by it. So don't make me take the spotlight, you can have the final say” he said, “Amaze me with your words”

He looked at me expectantly. “I don't know...” I said, “What do you want to hear?”

“You say whatever you want” he leaned sideways, “I'm sure it will be awesome”


“When I see people treating angels differently, and angels working so hard to treat them the same, I start to wonder if it is something that is normal. I'm not sure if angels really are treated worse, I don't know anything, the more I wonder about it. What if the necklaces that made angels all disappeared one day. Or we gave them to humans to have, then would we see everything differently?”

“We probably would. Wow, that was amazing. Colita, you're the most amazing girl I've met.” He clapped, like I had said a speech, and he was the only one in the audience. Like I had been reciting lines for a part.


“Now, what am I supposed to do in this circumstance?” I said.

He leaned over and stretched his arms me. “You can hug me as well” 

I did so, and we sat there outside the school gates. People kept walking past, but we didn't see any of them, we sat there against the gate, debriefing.

“I don't want you to leave” he said, “I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night reminded that you're going to be leaving this school soon, and I don't want you to, can't you ask your boss to stay?”

I felt his wet tears on my shoulder, they were sinking into my uniform. A uniform that I probably wouldn't be wearing for much longer. What was I supposed to do here?

“You're supposed to comfort me” he said, and speak a monologue.

“I love you, and you're much closer to me than you realize, you always were. But I don't want to say anymore, because you and I will both start crying.”

“Why?”

“Because of bad luck” I said.

“People can cry over anything” Nathan said. “Some people cry over miserable stuff, some cry over funny stuff, my Mom always watches TV and cries. And the people in the world cry when they lose their loved ones. There are all things that it's okay to cry for.”

“I have a monologue” I said. 

Every time you play that song, someone nearby you dies.
Every time you play that song, someone nearby you is healed.
People are frequently rude and derogatory to us (death).
 People should learn to respect us, 
Since we were born when they were born and disappear when they disappeared. 
We stay with them longer than their life, 
longer than the short-lived companions that they meet on their travels. 
We (Death) enter the stage with the cast and exeunt off stage with them in absolute loyalty. We only see ourselves by advancing on this stage with them in a final performance.
 The moment a human is born, we are the first one beside them. 
And as the person gets older, we remind them of our frailty more and more often. 
We should no longer be ignored, 
If we want to create a harmonious society, people should listen to us with equal dedication.
As our famous saying goes: 
“Because a grave is not alive right now it has never been alive.”

“What's that?” Nathan said. “It's weird”

“It's a song from death, they sing it softly to themselves when they're lonely, its something they have come to know. It's like a national anthem to them. But when they read it, they cry over it, they bawl over it because it means so much to them. They have this quote; humans don't understand it, and angels kind of understand it but don't appreciate it. Only death workers understand it and can cry over it. Apparently some important scholar of theirs wrote it,”

Nathan sat still, “I heard you reciting it, and I couldn't cry, I couldn't even fake it. I don't relate to it at all. They seriously cry over this? Why...how is this even sad? It's just weird”

“Yeah, I don't really know” I said, “But they get it, they bawl over it and all that. Isn't it surprising though?” I said, “That death has an intimate poem and we can still understand it so well. It's like they're living a similar life to us.” 

“But it's not worth crying over” Nathan sad, “We should save our tears, if we use them all up on crying over everything, then when something really worth crying for comes along, we won't have any tears left. There won't be any tears left. And then we might really regret it. Crying is a personal thing.”

“When I think about my future” I said, “I don't see much, I'm just the same person going through the same tunnel again and again, I want to stop, I want to give up and stop, everything.”

“Why are you suddenly saying that?”

“I want to cry now” I said.

“Okay” he said, “Go ahead”

“What are you two doing?” Jason stood at the school gate with no expression.

---

### Chapter Seventy One

Here's a brief recap of what happened earlier,

“What are you two doing?” Jason stood at the school gate with no expression.

“Have you never seen two people hugging before? Do you think you could give us some space?”

Jason came and sat down next to us. “Sure, but I want to watch. This is the girl I had sex with the other day, and you're my friend, I'm curious.”

“You're weird”


“You're strong Colita” Jason said, while Nathan was gripping me.

“Why” I said past Nathan's ear. “Do you have to keep talking” Did Jason want a hug as well, bet he was too man to admit it.

“You're friend was Julia right, the weird girl”

“Huh?” I leaned over to see him kneeling down and watching us. “So? What about her?”


“Everyone in school said she was kind of weird, at least everyone said that” He was talking about her as well, long after she had left.

"Who is everyone?" I wanted to beat them up. 

“The guys say you're really strong, and you should really get into a fight to see just how strong she are.”

“Stop being ridiculous” Nathan released his grip and we came apart. Jasonw as pissing me off. He said whatever he liked, just to get my attention, and it was working.


Around the school gate was a feast of pigeons, they were cocking their heads back and forth all around us, looking for scraps.

“That pigeon looks like you, Jason” I laughed. Nathan looked and instantly noticed the one I was talking about. 

“Haha, it's true, look at those it's trying to get the others to go away from it”

“It doesn't try, they just do”

Jason laughed, “Then you're that one” he pointed to a pigeon missing a leg and with feathers half coming out.”

“What, are you saying I'm not attractive and am missing a foot? What are you doing here anyway, how come I have to spend all my private time with the likes of you.”

“You lost your close friend” Jason said, “I recently think I know how that feels”

Nathan was still trying to hug me, but I brushed him off. “Are you saying your friend died? Did they become deceased? Did they disappear off the face of the earth?”

“No, but Nathan doesn't talk to me anymore” Jason said, in a moment of clarity and sincerity. “And Matt has gone crazy. It's all because of you, I've lost my close friends as well.”

I hugged Nathan again. He didn't seem to hear anything, as long as I was hugging him. Sometimes these strong men really could be weak, and needed a female touch. A mother's touch. That was beautiful, that we could support each other like this.

“Is it beautiful?” Jason said. 

“It would be beautiful if we could do something for Julia's Mom” I said, “She is extremely depressed, it's a traumatic event that someone with black hair goes before someone with white hair.” 

“Do you want me to dress up as her?” Jason said. “I can do that”

I knew that the Master angels did these kinds of things in the past, the Italian angels in the North and Dutch and Flemish angels of the far South, flowering talent. They dressed up as other figures and pretended to be them, to relieve the mood. They were called flower boys, usually it was something specific to angel culture. Julia had grown up knowing she would eventually marry a flower boy at the wedding.

“It's dressing as a girl though” I said.

“Don't tell anyone else, it's just you me and Nathan who can know, but I enjoy cross dressing”

“Really?” That was unexpected, from him. I thought he would be someone who got himself dirty in dirt and bullied everyone else.

“So imagine this” Jason laid out his hands on the ground, “I can dress in Julia's old clothes, and hold flowers with make-up on. I might look exactly like her.”

“You could do it for prom” I said, jokingly.

Both guy's eyes widened, “That's such a good idea”

It wasn't though, it was disrespectful to Julia. “It's going to be weird” I said, “What are others going to think of you”

“Don't discourage him” Nathan said, “He's serious about it, besides it will make Julia's Mom feel better right?”

Jason grinned back at me, “She's going to be surprised isn't she.” It was ironic that it took Matt to get injured and sleeping in bed for his true side to come out.

“He's done it before” Nathan said, “For his sister as well”

“Joyce needed some money” he said, “I was able to raise it for her”

The more I imagined Jason dressed up, the more I couldn't resist wanting to actually see him. It unpredictable, my reaction what would he look like?? “Jason, you know, you're a really weird person” I said.

“Why thank you Colessa, and **** you too” he said.

“I always thought you were just another popular and fit guy who thought he was better than everyone else.”

“So just because I say I will cross dress, it changes your whole opinion of me? Isn't that kind of shallow?”

“I think there is a side of you when Matt isn't around, that wants attention and to be heard. Right now you've stopped acting cool for a short time, and we can talk to you properly”


“You've thought a lot about me...” he said.

“Of course I have, you're someone close to me”

“How about me, what do you know about me” Nathan said.

“I know a lot” I said, “But it's better not to say it”

“So it's bad stuff?” 

“No” I shook my head, “No, definitely not” Then I asked the boys about Matt. “He doesn't talk, why doesn't he talk, I want to know what he's thinking, because eh's so mysterious a lot of the time.”

“Women have always wanted to know what the man is thinking” Jason said. “I want to know a woman's point of view, that's why I started cross dressing”

His confessions were flowing like a waterfall. It seemed to be like he was hiding his weakness of cross-dressing by talking about extra things, to cushion it properly. “Jason” I said, “Morality is rare in this world, and most people don't have it, but when you meet someone who does have it, it sparks a long friendship. Because it's the biggest similarity between people.”

That was my reason for why I was able to talk to Jason and Nathan right now.


“People are all really interesting” Nathan said.

“And sexy” Jason said, “We're easily influenced by each other. But so many of us are dissatisfied.”


Jason always said stuff, for as long as I had known him, he just said stuff. He usually spouted nonsense but suddenly he said something so profound that it hit me and exploded like a paintball.

“The things we do and say, if we change our own life, then we probably will be less hypocritical of others. If we take the step instead of talking about taking the step, then a lot more good will happen in the world. We all find a job, do a job, then give up on the job and find another one. That's what we do, it's a process, you just have to live it instead of complaining about it”


For some reason, at that moment, those words clicked with me. No one had asked Jason to say them, no one had asked him about it, but he said it from himself.

“Oh Jason, I would like to get to know you better” I said.

He smiled, “I've got a big dick” he said, “If that helps”

The guys burst out laughing, and I sighed....I guess the moment was over.


“Anyway, Julia's Mom might be really happy.” Nathan said. “She might not.”

“Oh wow, great comment Nathan, that was super useful”


We talking about how the imaginary prom would play out, what color clothes Jason would wear, and how his waistline would look. And what if I went as a groom for him or something.

We talked about whether Julia's Mom would take it weirdly, or would she find it adorable and even adopt Jason as a pet. Jason slowly became more and more quiet as the conversation progressed, and it was just me and Nathan talking.

“Jason, are you still keen for it?” we said. “You could take a picture before leaving”

He shook his head, “It was a fun idea, but I'm not going to do it, but you guys are free to pretend to be Julia, I'm done.”

Was he acting cool again. I looked around for Matt. Was he here somewhere?

Jason stood up, he was lagging a bit, like it was an act more triumphant or with gravity than something it should carry.

I walked away a bit, “Okay, bye guys” I said, “This is enough for now, but Jason, I hope you dress up” Nathan put on his bag and started walking home as well.

Then, when I was about fifty meters away from the school gate, Jason screamed out “Colita, don't leave us, come back” His voice was so strained that it didn't sound like him. Nathan was so far away, but he heard Jason as well.

“I won't” I screamed back, “I will be here Tomor-row”

As soon as I screamed, suddenly the pigeons all flew away. There were so many pigeons around the school gate right now, but they all took flight the moment I yelled. But when Jason had there was no difference.

Then I walked back, and saw everyone walking past differently. There was something very interesting about each of them. I looked over a group of students from another school, I wondered if any of these students who were doing a ton of homework and worrying about deadlines ever thought about angels. Did they ever wonder if angels were among them? Did they ever think about fairness, or equality, or that others might be unhappy around them?

Maybe that was why Julia could die so easily, because we were all walking on thin ice, and once we stopped walking, the ice cracked and we fell into the black empty hole underneath. It had always been there. 

The world we had around us was so fragile. 

Sanity was momentary.

### Chapter Seventy Two

```
Ah sorry guys, if the chapter was boring. I was struggling with my life mentally. So much has been happening and I can hardly handle it. My mind feels like it is exploding a lot of the time, and I went for a two hour walk, but I don't know, I keep thinking about this girl, and I keep on having recurring thoughts. All in all, today is a hard day.

I'm trying to bring eveyrthing together and I'm starting to rush, just because my life situation is changing so much, so I need to balance it properly.


We all do work. But afterwards what happened? How did it relate to the things we were all saying and doing. What deeper force was there besides the simple one at work? 

A lot of the work we do it replaceable and not 'us' at all, it's something that anyone can do. That's what I think.

But I'm mental...so whatever, yeah? How am I still alive...

I think back to how some of these things I'm putting into the story, I put them here before my life had changed, before I met the girl, and things were all still normal, I had no idea what turns I would be taking. This was when I first went to Auckland, so I was trying to finish this book. 

Who knew that I would fall so hard for a girl and think about her all day everyday for months to come...


Ahhh, why am I still alive.

your depressed author
```

I was walking past a bookstore. This bookstore was always closed, but today it was open. Then I walked past the shelf and saw a book called  Queens & Wannabes, which was what inspired the movie Mean Girls. I started reading a few pages and saw how it was an amazing insight into the character and behavior of young teen girls, bullying, social status, etc.

Then elsewhere in the bookstore were all the 'romance' books, and erotica. It was ironic because we never ever saw anyone reading these erotic books. In fact, every single book in this store was erotic, except for the Queens & Wannabes book. But no one ever read them, everyone who came to this store only read the one non erotic book it had, and then left. There had to be an audience though, since the bookstore was open. 

Or maybe that's why it was always closed?


These books all were keys to unlock a door somewhere, we just didn't know which one. All the visitors to this store never went to the other erotic books, it was a spectacular phenomenon. They crowded and lined up for the one book.

Then I saw Joyce, she was walking down this same street again. Coming back from wherever she always went to.


“Oh, what a surprise” she said, “This store's open, you're buying their one non erotic book?”

“Yes” I smiled, “It's funny isn't it. But then who buys the other books? There has to be an audience.” 

“Come on Colita, that's not nice” she said. And I was surprised, befcause I had said it as a joke. It wasn't even meant as something mean... Now it made me look bad.


Joyce walked past me, she looked shocked and said something completeluy different “You're a wounded person.” She put her arm on my shoulders, “It's okay, you can talk to me, I'm listening. You're a wounded person okay, you're a wounded person”

“What does that mean? You're pretty much just some random person on the street”

“You're wounded, you're wounded, you're super wounded. I can see it instantly, even a random person on the street can see that.”
 
Then I don't know why, I didn't want to, but I cried. At that moment, Joyce had said the perfectly right words with the right intonation and right curiosity and right force, just to affect me in this way. If it had been a day earlier or later, who knew what I would have felt?

She came forward and hugged me. And I sank into her

Wounds can only be healed by other people, she can't reach that far in. They were like looking into a mirror, and could only be seen by others.


And what if she said it to everyone else who crossed her path as well?”

“You're the fifth one today” she smiled, “Not the first, and not the last”

“Ah, okay thanks” I said.

### Chapter Seventy Three

```
Can you believe we've done this many chapters? I'm trying to get through a lot of things...haha.

Thank you, as always

Kevin
```

I woke up thinking about random things. I don't know where they came from, I woke up thinking about an animation of an old man, about a cube house, where he goes deeper and deeper for different views. Then I also woke up thinking about how I could have entered this world as a guy. Why had I not thought of this earlier, then I might not have had so much trouble with Matt. 

But after an hour the thoughts were gone and life was normal without disruption, and I was on my way to school. I stared at a girl walking past blankly, then she looked at me, so I looked away.

I went to my mp3 and chose a song. It made me want to live life to the fullest.


Laura Veirs & The Saltbreakers - Drink Deep


Now            the      raging           of the                 forest fires                      ends

On my way to school, I saw some kids still coming home from a late party last night. They stood in the middle of the  road and shouted stuff while wobbling home still drunk from last night.

And then at school in the morning, people everywhere are talking about stuff that's happening. Max was out of bed, he was waiting for me outside my homeroom, and he walked me to the bathroom where we could talk.

“I want you to talk to Matt” he said, “And try and convince him to work with us”

“But he won't” I said, “Why are you asking me to do this? You've come here but haven't done anything”

“This has nothing to do with us” he said, “It's about our race, you females always get so emotional.” Max had completely the wrong idea, he didn't even listen to what I said.

“Are you kidding? I've already talked to him, he doesn't listen, he's crazy”

“Well, talk to him again. And this time try.” 

He was so stubborn. He came from outside and thought he understood whatever was going on. He thought talking was going to make Matt drop his weapons and his violent ideas.

Max walked me outside the nurse's room. Then he held the door open for me. “Good luck” he said, “Colita” 


They go there to try and convince him to become good and not to do these bad things anymore. But now he knows that they won't hurt him, and has grandiose delusions of his power.

“Ah Colita” Matt rolled over. He dropped whatever he was reading and turned to me. “I'm really comfortable right now, no emotions, but I'm still comfortable” he said.

“Did you come to tell me a bedtime story?”

“Um...no?” I drove straight to the point. “I want you to leave us alone”

“Us?” he said.

“Us angels and humans should be equal, we're all living in the same place”

“You're just things that can talk, and living in the same place of course.” (Show the depth of his hatred, something only someone so hateful could say)

“Max said he has a huge vision, and if you can support us, then everything...”

“Oh, you finally say his name, interesting...”

When I said Max's name, it didn't sound so sincere, I thought I was forcing myself to say this. I don't know how I felt about Max anymore, we only argued whenever we met. So why was I supporting him in something I didn't want to.

“It's more important than me” I said, “And more important than you, it goes beyond individuals, it's about world peace”

“F*** world peace, that's a disaster that's not going to be solved by me changing my mind.

I struggled to see if I was supporting Max or my boss, I wasn't so sure anymore.

“Tell me a story” he said. “A bedtime story”

“Then will you think about it?”

“Maybe”

“Okay” I said. “But you have to go first”

He shrugged, “Okay, I've got a lot of stories, people say I'm full of stories. Here goes.” He moved back in the bed and leaned against the wooden rest.

When he spoke, he was so concentrated. Just so concentrated, but he wasn't saying anythign amazing, but he treated his words like they were the richest wine flowing forth. 

That made me listen.

“Do you know Dragon Ball Z?” he said.

“No” I said, “What is that?”

“It's a Japanese program” he said, “About fighters and aliens”

“Okay”

“Well, the main character is called Goku, and he is an alien who protects humans and defeats enemy aliens who come to earth.”

“Okay” I said.

“It's just like us” Matt pointed to himself, then at me. 

“No” I frowned, “It's not like us at all”

“You're right, I'm just joking, okay?” He looked out the window again, “Anyway, my favourite character in the show is Mahjin Bu, he is the strongest fighter and the absolute strongest fighter.”
 
“You're very specific” I said, “Could you be any more specific? Maybe you should go into marketing.”

“But Goku, our main character, he destroys Bu. He rips this alien apart and creates world peace.” Matt grinned, “Just like you want to”

“No...”

He went on, “Everyone who watched the show, who read the manga, everyone thought Bu was finished. No one could survive a fight with Goku, who was the main character. But then just as we thought that,all of the pieces of Bu that were blown up started moving and gathering together into one lump. They all bonded like rubbish, and it became a skinny version of Bu. This Bu was ten times stronger than the last one that they barely managed to defeat.”

I didn't know where he was going with this story, or was it just a story that wasn't supposed to have a meaning? Not everything had to have a meaning right?

“Do you understand?” Matt said, “I'm frustrated, but excited as well, just like Goku,  because I destroy these angels and they keep healing and coming back stronger with more knowledge.”

He talked to me about it, as if I wasn't an angel. He was telling me how he was going to destroy my race, everything I knew.

“Someone might ask me, Oh Matt, is he more frustrated or is he more excited? I have never been sure.” Matt grinned, “The answer is that I'm more excited. Goku must have been so excited with joy when he was able to squash these lumps again and again, each time with renewed satisfaction. It's just like chewing gum again and again. It becomes less interesting as you go on, but it's still interesting and fun. It's like playing with a toy...”

“Okay, enough, I've had enough” I put my hand in front of him.

“I was finished anyway”  (“What, why?”)

“It makes me uncomfortable” It was the first time Matt talked about his feelings with me. And it just made me scared. His inner emotions were not in turmoil, they weren't traumatic, they just didn't make sense. No sense at all. Why would he interpret a children's show in such a way?

All I saw in him was a chaos that was so quiet that it hardly even existed. I think that's all he saw as well.

“Okay, it's your turn” he said, “Tell me your story”

“Any story?” I said. I would make up a story for him to hear.

“Anything”

“Does it have to be heartfelt? Or can it be a random thing I overheard?”

“It can be anything” he moved his broken leg, or he tried to, “Anything at all”

He was treating me like a human. 

“Well, you might find this boring, I'm not very good at telling stories.”

He looked at me seriously, he had already started listening. 

“There is a little girl who is really sad. She never has any friends, she thought she did one time, but they disappeared one by one for various reasons.”

I paused, and I knew Matt was listening.

“She argued with her closest friends a lot, and after she lost them she became even sadder, and then never saw them again. Then every morning she would force herself to walk on, no matter how difficult it was, but reality was even harder. And then, sometimes she regretted being born. She was always walking alone. When she looked behind her, everyone was gone. But even then, she continued walking, that was her strength.”

I stopped and sat still. Time passed on the top of a spoon.

“Is that all?” Matt said. Then when I didn't answer, he laughed.

“That was so short it wasn't even a story” he looked out the window and watched the leaves falling and the sun shining, the golden clouds moving past in huge miasma's.

“You're so bad at story telling, that didn't make any sense, I bet a primary school student could say it better.”

“There were so many weak points, like how everyone becomes alone eventually, it's so cheesy and unrealistic, it's been overused, you should say something more interesting, the whole losing friends is overdone. You could have said something like, everyone loses all of their friends in the end, and she wasn't used to it..”

(Crying sounds onomatopoeia) Ha,

Oo,

Mm,

“Colita, why are you crying?” he said.

---

### Chapter X Seventy Four

“How did it go?” Max was on my tail as soon as I left the room. “How come you're crying? Is that a bad sign? Should I expect the worst?”

I walked away and he followed me. He always followed me, he never thought about it, he just was there.

I walked all the way to one of the back staircases and stared in the mirror at myself. Then I walked along, went downstairs, and turned the corners. It was dark here, since there were no classes the lights were turned off. I went into one of the classrooms and stared at the empty desk, and sat down, and cried and cried. I don't know why, the tears just kept coming like sunshine in the sky.

Then I went to the side of the room and sat down on the teacher's seat. I looked around, at all the things lying around, the files and paperwork. Then I pretended a class was here. I read through some notes. Then I pretended to be a student who had always grown up here, who didn't know anything else, who didn't have to care about angels and world peace, and equality, and trying to live a life where I could be happy. I just imagined being a carefree student, the way it should be.

Why did I have to carry such a huge weight, I just wanted to be like everyone else. It was because I wanted to be like everyone else that all of this was happening.

“I guess it's over” Max stood in the doorway, he had followed me here, the exact same path, he knew where I was. His hand caressed the door handle he had moved, and the door frame. Like he was a beautiful man standing in a moment captured in time.

“I really hoped you could change his mind” Max said, “I really hoped so, but I don't think it's possible anymore” Max walked over and sat at one of the desks. He pulled a chair out and sat there with his arms on the desk, he leaned over. “I've never been to school, I've never learned a lot of the things that students here do, I've never played sports and had a team to work with. 

“Us angels” he said, “We're all alone in the world” He stood up, “And that boy too, he's alone in the world. If we could do this, there might be less people alone...but ah”

Then he said the words that really made me crack. “I'm sorry if I asked too much of you, I put everything into you Colita”

“I'm sorry” I gasped between breaths, “I'm really sorry”

I wasn't a pretty little seventeen year old girl anymore, I wasn't a thirty three year old angel, I wasn't any of those. Right now I was an ugly thing that could hardly breathe and hardly talk. My eyes were swollen red, and my nose was running. My cheeks were twisted in like a withered flower.


“I...m really....sorry”

“I”

“I...”

The time passed quickly, I struggled to hold myself. I at least wanted to be able to apologize properly, but I wasn't even able to do that. 

“Your words mean more to me than anything you can say” And Max took me to a restaurant. It was an expensive place, with an orchestra of silverware.

“That's okay” I said, “You don't need to do this” He always spent money too easily.

“Let me buy it for you” he said.

“No” I shook my head, “I don't want to buy anything”

The waitress led us to a calm table on the border of reality. The napkins were set, and forks and knives and love was laid out in an organized manner.

“Call me if you need anything” he said.

Max ordered a couple of cigarettes, and the waiter handed them to us on plates. It was a really expensive restaurant.

“Let's have a private chat” Max said, “A chat where no one is listening to us, we can be sure that we can say whatever we want, and it will only be to each other. I'm recovered now, I just recovered from that gunshot, so I'm fine, I'm feeling fine.”


“Okay” I said, “What do you want to talk about? What would you like to talk about?”

“About me” Max said, “This is the first time I get to sit down like this with you, I've wanted to do it for some time, but something's always happening.”

“I'm glad” I said, “I'm glad to have someone to talk to” Then I started to talk about Max, and then I kept talking. And I realized that I knew a lot about him.

“You know the most about me” Max said.

I told him about himself, “I heard you're super powerful, angels were all originally derived from people who were able to raise the dead. These were people with extraordinary powers, and humans isolated them and made them live by themselves. They tortured and killed most of them because they were so different.”

“This is true” he said, “That is our history. I can bring back any one I love, I can raise the dead, because I have the original power that the first angels had. Over time its been diluted like Homeopathy.”

“My powers, and the other angels, they have all been tamed right?” I said. “But I heard you're really strong, and the other angels were saying that you were really creative in how you used your powers, and you did really good things”

“Oh wow” he said, “I never knew they said that” He held his plate, it was so smooth that it reflected his chin. The plates in front of me reflected me as well. The tip of the fork reflected my eye, I had to move around to see which one. Then the countless chandelier's above us reflected down on us.

“I tried to step in and deal with the issue” he said, “But even I was taken down by these humans who are just living with their petty affairs.”

The dinner came and we ate it smoothly. Max paid at the end, and he led me to the top of a tower, and we watched the city. Then he drove me to a small place where there was a river. By now it was about eleven, but I didn't want to go home, I didn't want to be alone and suffer my own turmoil. My thoughts became loud and unbearable recently.

Max stopped next to a river. “Let's do some midnight fishing, okay?” he said. When I stayed in the car; not because I didn't want to, but because I wanted him to help me out, he gave me words of reluctance. “It might be our last time”

I jumped out of the car immediately and went to join him fishing. He caught a trout and stuck it in his basket.

“How much longer will the world last?” I said.

“For a long time” he said, “But the world for us? Not very long, after we are gone, then there's no more new angels.” 

I wanted to cry again, but I felt sorry for Max. He was the one who had tried so hard for it, I hadn't even asked Matt properly to help us, I wasn't strong enough to. I knew I wasn't right, I was too selfish and afraid to ask him properly. Every time I tried to approach him my words seized up and I couldn't think straight.

I was so afraid, what if he heard everything properly and said no. Then there was nothing.

Max gave me the fishing rod, we sat peacefully, I heard the river flowing, I took my shoes off and dipped my toes, then my feet into it. The smell of trout was coming from the basket. And Max leaned against me. He was strong and showed me how to twist the rod. He brought out some milk, and started sharing it with both of us.

“I just went to the supermarket before this” he said.

“Remember when I was pregnant, I only drank milk?” I said. And then he became silent, and we both sat there  not knowing what to say, and I became afraid that it might become awkward between us.

“Throw it out, then something may bite.” It was heavy against my fingers, and I was growing tired quickly.

Was this a date?

Max took over with the fishing, then he threw a long picture at me. He went to the truck and brought out fruit.

“I have some oranges” he said, “We can eat these”

“Do you have something to eat?”

“I just told you, oranges”

“I'm hungry though”

“I went to the supermarket and only got oranges okay?” He threw one over at me, but I didn't realize, and it hit my head and smashed into orange.

“Time is so slow when you're in love” I said.


Max laughed, “I thought you said you're hungry, why are you talking about love”

“Because I'm hungry for love”  He threw another orange, this time I was ready, but it slipped out of my fingers and was lying in the grass right next to the riverbank. He stood at the truck and laughed, pointing one finger at my hair. Right then I saw him, he didn't look like an angel, he looked like a normal human, like every other guy who came and went all the time. And it was beautiful.

“What are you smiling at?”

“Throw another one, I'll catch it” I said.

He picked up the basket and threw it, I missed again, the orange soared through the air like a catapult and skidded through the water. I think a trout came up from the water and ate it.

“Quick” Max pointed behind me, “There's a trout, throw out the rod”  I stood up in a hurry, clumsily, and threw the rod out, it completely missed the mark and the trout was gone.

“You suck” An orange hit my head, it broke up and left the juice running down my hair.

“No, you suck” I ran to the trout in the basket.

“No, not the fish!” He was too late, I threw it at him full force, it hurdled through the air and kicked it's tail, the tail slapped Max in the face.

Max feigned getting angry. The trout was covered with orange juice. He took more oranges and threw them at me. By now I couldn't stop laughing, this was so much fun.

Then Max came over with the rest of the basket, he dumped the oranges over me. Half of them were rotten and collapsed into juice balls like water balloons over my head. Next moment I was covered in orange peel and juice, my hair was dyed orange.


Max went over to the truck and turned the lights on, they beamed on us. He sat down on the front of the truck and crossed his arms. “How do you feel” he said, “You're in an interview”

“Soaking” I said, “I'm soaked” The car lights were so bright in my face, I couldn't see my audience.

“This is your spotlight” he said, “Show us how you feel”

I was on stage, I screamed so loud that the clouds moved apart and the ground trembled.

Matt looked up as the clouds moved apart. The moon came clear, the stars appeared. Like a curtain that had forgotten to unravel its contents. The curtain blocked the inside from the outside, made it look pretty inside to distract, maybe.

“I'm embarrassed” I took the opportunity on this makeshift stage, I paced back and forth, remembering that Max was watching, this was one time when he was really listening to me.

“I'm embarrassed right now, so embarrassed” I pretended to be in a monologue. I ran to the trout and held it up in front of me and talked to it, like it was my fishy lover.

“Not all angels are like me, you know”

“There's a trout behind you” Max said, “You can catch it Colita”

I turned around like a barbarian woman, I dived at the rod and threw it to the water, but nothing happened.

“Where?” The spotlight was too strong, we couldn't see a thing. Max was just shouting out random things to see me react.

“Max, I won't forgive you for this”

“For what?”

“For not taking me on a proper date”

“There's another fish, go for it” I must have looked funny with my dripping orange hair, I threw the rod out but instead of going to the water, it soared into the air.

But it didn't fall.

“What are you doing? Where's the string?” 

“I don't know” I tried pulling but it didn't go anywhere, things just kept moving more and more.

Max came over, he joined me in the spotlight and we both looked up to where the rod was connected and pointed up. 

“I think it's connected to that star” I said.

“No way” he said, “That's not possible”

“It's possible, it's happening” I said. Then we both tugged and tugged, and the star moved a bit.

“Tug some more” Max said, “I swear it's connected to that star”

“No it's not” I said, “It can't be”

“See look, when we move the rod it moves”

“No, that's just you moving, and you think the star's moving”

“You're right” he said. “I'm just getting tired”

Then I pulled the rod gently, and the star moved out of place. No way, it was actually moving. Maybe it was a firefly, maybe it was something else. I pulled some more, then Max saw it as well.

“It's definitely moving” he said.

“That's what I told you earlier”

“No, it wasn't moving earlier, now it's moving” 

Whatever, we both pulled, and the star moved to the side. Then it grew bigger.

“Keep tugging” Max said, “This is a big one”

I just hoped it wasn't a Magicarp. Those things were overrated.

We pulled and heaved, and the star was pulled down. And what landed was a boy. He was on the grass, then rubbed his knees and adjusted his clothes.

“I went to play hide and seek” he said, “And ran a bit too far”

I knew who he was, I had heard about him. “I think I accidentally caught Julia's brother” I said.

He looked at me funny, I was an orange haired woman. And I guess it was weird because we had drinks of milk lying around and one or two trout. It was a party Colita-Max party.

Max talked calmly, as if the boy wasn't even there. It wasn't a trout so he wasn't interested.

We had accidentally caught Julia's brother who had gone to play hide and seek a long long time ago. Now he was back and running from death still, but he stopped in front of me. “Have you seen Julia?” he said, “This is her school, and she should be in your grade now.” 

I burst out laughing, it was a late night, but what was happening here was so ridiculous that I couldn't help it, it was too funny.

“No” I said, “Face your difficulties in life and stop running, oh, and stop off at your Mom's place as well, she'll want to see you too.”

He looked back at us once or twice as he walked passed. To him we were just two people in love.

“So, what just happened now” I explained to Max, partly for myself, but partly to let him know that I wanted him to know that I knew he didn't know. “We threw a fishing rod into the sky, and then it didn't catch one of the fish, but caught a star and pulled it down.” Then I added some Colita spices to the mix, “Now we are in the same mood as earlier, when things were changing in the world. Now that we are in this mood we should capture it.”

“Huh, what are you talking about?” Max said. “You're going off on your tangents”

“That's okay, I'm allowed to once in a while”

---

### Chapter Seventy Five - Lacey the Friend

I walked into homeroom, there were five people all asleep. Matt walked in a few minutes later, with a gun slinging at his hips, and grenades in his pockets, bulging like tumours. I didnt' want to know what he was going to use them for.

“Matt, please remove your weapons”

“I don't have any” he said, “I went through the metal detector”

BS, I called it. He didn't do anything.

Mr. Gilbert called it as well, “Go and walk through it, weapons arent' allowed” 

“Here's my ticket” Matt brought out a letter saying that he had passed the metal detector

“Always give the evidence” Mr. Gilbert waved him off.

I didn't know how that was possible. How did he get through a metal detector with guns and grenades on his person? Wasn't a metal detector designed to specifically uh...stop these things? I guess there were some things I was yet to learn.


Then some girls walked in, they were talking about another girl. Like they always did. “She didn't go to the party last week, so we all thought she was hurt or something, but I wasn't too sure you know. Then they talked about another boy. “He doesn't talk to me at work, but he talks to me afterwards and texts me a lot. I can't get used to it”

Girls always talked about other girls, and complained so easily. About the smallest things and subtlest things.

“The other day Jenna was talking to my boyfriend, she was moving her hair, like a hurricane, the whole time. She followed him all the way to the convenience store. She was saying all sorts of things, like flirty stuff”

Another girl said, “Something like 'you friggen rock, please, please, let me suck your c***' ”

It had nothing to do with what was going on in my head. And I wanted to yell at them. But they all fell down laughing.

The girls came and sat in front of me, laughing, and putting their bags down on the chairs, oblivious to what was going on around them. Oblivious to me sitting behind them. A classroom wasn't small enough sometimes.

“So tell me, what did he say, and what did she say to him”

“He was acting like he didn't care, it was so try-hard, it was funny, I wasn't even upset, I was past the point of caring about it anymore.”
 
Gossip made all the girls come, they all wanted to know what it was that would make the popular girls fall.

“But he would never care about me” one girl said, “I feel like I'm pretty enough compared to all of you guys”

“No way”, “No way”, “No way” They all responded one by one, like it was the biggest issue in the world. To them it was. If they weren't pretty, then life wouldn't go on. It would hit a dead end impasse.

“But he spoke to me about it as well”

“Shh,...she's listening to us”

Then I realized they were speaking about me, the corner of their eyes looked at me, then back into the middle of their conversation.

“He told me he likes her, so he's not interested in any other girls”

One of the girls turned to me. “So, Colita, I heard Nathan likes you”

“I don't know” I said, “It's none of my business”

“What do you mean it's none of your business, we here all like Nathan, so it's definitely everyone's business. You're very lucky so don't you dare hurt his feelings. He's a fragile soul, a delicate tissue.”


“A crush is all it is” I said, “If he really likes me he won't...”

“Won't what”

I stopped mid-sentence, my mouth became a crazy jukebox. Lacey came out from the crowd of girls, she was on their side again obviously.

But she wasn't what she said was so sincere that it made me want to melt and lie on the ground like a chopstick. 

“Colita is a proper girl” she said, “She's not an angel and she's not some kind of half made human, she's really a wonderful person if you get to know her.”

I couldn't believe she was standing up for me. I never expected her to say something like that. Coming from her, it was amazing. She talked and the girls watched her. Then she made an official apology to me. She didn't need to, but I didn't know what was going on in her head recently, it must have been something heavy. But to me it was something that passed.

But I was surprised at her courage, the girls all heard us, and she put herself lower.


"That time, many months ago, I should have said this earlier Colita, But I'm sorry you saw me with Matt, believe it or not, it was bad timing. No, I mean it wasn't, it was because I was so immature” Then she said this part which made me see her maturity, something that had grown in her like crazy since I last saw her. She said. “If I think back to it now, I should have just let it all go instead of holding onto it, it's like water that keeps flowing through, you bring your hands up after holding the water for an hour, and you come up with nothing, or the same amount as if you had dipped it in for one second.”

Then I cried, because that was exactly what how I thought. How had she become so similar to me? How had I become so similar to her?

I thought fish were solid clumps of water, they came in the form of flapping things.

The fight between Lacey and I, or whatever was left of it, officially vanished right there and then. I think the other girls all wowed in disbelief, so this was how two real women vanquished their enemies. By making them their friends so there was no need for war anymore.
All through our war I never recognized one of my greatest friends, Lacey would have been the first to kiss me, or ask an angel to heal me when the time came. 
She was fake, as soon as she heard I was an angel, she crouched on the ground and apologized quickly without hesitation. She took everything seriously. I could have taken it as damage being done, and that she was just being insincere. Although she was acting close, she actually no longer cared. I could have said that, but it was tiring to think that way for so long. 

Besides, there was no reason to.


“Colita” she said, “I'm most sorry about one thing though, it's wasn't your fault. Julia's death. It was more of mine than yours”

“No, don't say that” I could see her shock at Julia's suicide, it was coming through now, finally. She could have been the most shocked, and she was suffering from the trauma of it this whole time when she never came to school. I was too stuck up in my own life to recognize it.

“The death of a friend” I said, “is the birth of a majestic story”

“No” Lacey said, “I actually caused it, that day, I told her that she was ugly, I said no one liked her, and you thought she was annoying as well.” In front of the other girls who were watching every word, every unsaid word, Lacey had tears, and she broke down like a puddle.


“It was actually my fault” she said. ”Really, why aren't you yelling at me right now, why don't you curse me?”

“I don't need to” I said.

### Chapter Seventy Six

```
Maybe I'm too proud, that's why I feel like I should be doing something else. Yes, but it is also because I want to be somewhere else, wanting to do big things, instead of getting exhausted over accomplishing nothing much and making a hundred dollars.

Now I am hardly able to write because I'm so tired, and the mood is still at work, using music to drive me out, drive my soul to life. It's just such nonsense. Why do I have to slave away, couples are here as well, everyone is slaving away for this, everyone is slaving away over nothing, just more and more nonsense piled on top of other things.

(Change the scene where Nathan is doing stuff, make it so he is just watching and can't join in, and Colita is happy with that.)
```

My world view was getting twisted and destroyed so much like a vine crawling a wall, but moving around in the wind and growing in strange ways. So much that I no longer knew how it worked.

Lacey was breaking down in front of me. The other girls didn't know what happened but they caressed her and whispered their goodwill to her. She absorbed it like a sponge, slowly growing bigger and bigger as other girls began to cling onto her. The boys all stared, they had never seen anything like it.

Except for Nathan, he took the opportunity to talk to me. I felt fingers brush my arm, and people everywhere were doing things. But it was Nathan behind me,  he caressed me like he was making bread. Then I moved him away, and moved away from him, and swung my bag in front of me and took out a notepad. Having him here so suddenly, after Lacey's confession to me, I just wanted to tell him everything. The things that had been heaving on my chest for such a long time now.

“What is it?” he said.

“I'm writing a letter” I said, “For you”

The sponge that was around Lacey started to break up, and they noticed Nathan all over me. It was a problem, since half of these girls were in love Nathan.

Nathan ignored them and whispered in my ear, “What's in the letter that's more important than being with me”

The girls broke us up. They couldn't bear to see Nathan talking to me and specifically only me. Jason and Matt sat on the side, half asleep. Lazy boys.

“I still love you” he said, “You can finish writing the letter for me later, whether you're an angel or not, I still love you the same”


“Enough Nathan, give her some space, not in class okay?”

Then Nathan came to me during morning break, I was walking to the cafeteria but he pulled me to the side and confessed to me hard.

I mean hardcore, there was no preparation sentence, introduction, or anything.

“I love you” he said.


“Oh wow excuse me, that's a bit creepy.” I was shocked. “Let me let it sink in....okay, that's quite nice.”

“I really love you, I've never loved a girl so much like I love you” he said. “You're the perfect girl for me” He was moving closer now, he was going to make me his. If I stayed like this, I would become his.

I pushed him away. “You can't”

“Why? What's the reason? Tell me and I will try to change it”

“Because...” I held my breath, I might as well let it all out now.

“I'm your mother” I said. “That's why”

“What? My mother?” He laughed and tried to hug me. 

I didn't want to say any more, it was too cruel. Why did it have to be like this? I didn't want this to happen, and neither did he. But romance just wasn't destined between us. I let him hug me, his arms coated me, but then I flung them off, like letting go of a cape and becoming a superhero.

He sunk to the ground, he hadn't expected that answer. “Why not?”


“I can't tell you right now, but just read this letter please.” It dropped on the ground and fell near his face where he was crouched. “Just read it please, I can't tell you right now”.

I'm writing this as you're sitting there in homeroom. Now all I can think about is how I don't even have the courage to tell this to you directly, the way you should hear it. A long long time ago one angel met another angel, and the two of them became best friends, and then they had a child. But the child wasn't an angel, because his Mummy wasn't strong enough. Then they gave the child a name, but he was taken away from them because he wasn't a human. And the people believed that a human shouldn't be raised by angels.


Your hand is on me as you're watching me scribble, you keep asking me what I'm writing, and I'm sorry I can't answer you properly. But I'm your mother Nathan, I never got the chance to raise you, and now you've become a proper man, a proper human being, better than I could have expected. I'm so happy for you, but I know I also don't deserve to be your mother, no mother would ever leave their child, no matter how important they were. So next time we meet can we please act like this letter never existed, let's just have everything go the same way, it's too difficult. Just make sure you know that I always loved you, even when I wasn't there to say so. I love you so much, even though I never knew where you were or what you were doing, I always thought about you, all the time..

---

### Chapter Seventy Eight

“Read that letter later” I said.

“I don't believe it” he said, 

“It's true though, I'll show you some evidence” I moved my T-shirt up and put his hand on over my crotch. He got the message, he was all over me touching my breasts, rippling my nipples like a baby. This must have been how it would have been if I had breastfeeding him. Then he held my waist and hugged me so tightly.


I moved his hand to my axe wound. “Reach down” I pulledmy skirt up, “Touch me”

It was so slippery for him, he had trouble navigating through the rainforest to drop the bomb into the planet. His nails rubbed against my skin and moved in and out, faster and faster.

“Put your hand in deeper” I said, “Your whole fist, I'm not looking for pleasure here”

“My fist?” Nathan looked surprised, “Are you sure?”

He had come out of there, I was sure just his fist would be fine.

His fist went in, then his arm went in, I kept pulling him in like a blackhole. Then his shoulder hit my thighs. “There's something in there” I said. “Do you feel it? You don't need to touch around the edges, just go deep. The edges are nasty.”

His eyes widened, “I feel something, it feels like a dildo” I felt his fingers clench somehting and then his arm came out, and his wrist, and finally his hands, clutching the thing in the air.

“It's not a dildo, it's a penis”


It had been left in me like an ancient fossil bone dug out of the earth. It was like reaching into a deep tub of water because something had dropped in. There was my vagina juices running down Nathan's right cheek and his neck. He had gone pretty deep. It was like going into a rubbish bin to retrieve somehting valuable that had dropped in the trash.

“Sorry...I forgot to give it back” Nathan's penis had been inside me for a long time now, He had to open me up to find it.

“Far out, I'm so relieved though, is this mine?” He wiped his cheek and neck free of juices. 

“Yeah, I'm sorry, I forgot to give it back”

“Nah, no worries, I'm just glad to have it now, better late than never.”

He dropped his pants and showed me his oranges without an apple. He got the penis in his hand and scrwed it in, he pressed it really hard for about twenty seconds. “Just give me a moment”

He stuck it on and  his balls glowed in joy, they vibrated like an electric massage machine silently.

“Take all the time you need, it looks painful”

“Oh, not really, just you know...casual”

“Yep got it, casual”

What kind of conversation were we supposed to have? How many mothers in the world had forgotten to give their son their penis back. I was an absolute disgrace.

“Now I can be a man” he said, “I can lose my virginity” Then he looked confused, “Wait, how come you have my penis?” he said.

“Nathan!!!?!!!” Did he still not get it even after I went to these lengths? Did I have to tell him?

“Did you steal it?” he said.

“What.The.Fruit?” Get it straight man.

“How come you don't get it? How is it possible for me to go to your pants, and take your penis? Do you know how? If you know, then can you teach me?”

What was wrong with him, why would he accuse me of that?

“I don't know how to pull it off, even if you pull it, it doesn't just come off right?”

“No, I don't think so?” I sighed, I wouldn't even touch his penis if it had true love smeared over it.

“Then how come you had my penis, was it inside you the whole time?”

“Yes” Why did he have to make me say it,“It was there the whole time, from the start” Wasn't that something easy to see? He had seen it come out of me.

“Huh? How come?” he really had no idea, why were guys so clueless?

“Because I'm your mother?”

“Are you asking me? Or are you sure?”

“Nathan.” I prepared to gap it, “I'm your mother, okay? Please just think about that” 

“But you're Colita” he said, “The girl I love”

“No Nathan, you confessed to your mother, not Colita. The person you loved was...you? But I love you Nathan, truly, just read the letter okay?” I handed him the letter out straight. Rolled up like a parchment from the past.

“That's what a lot of people call me, their true love.”

I didn't say anything. 

“Urgh, you're disgusting” Nathan said, “That's what you would usually say, or something like that. Why don't you say that?”

“Because it's not a joke” I said. “It's not”

“It's not is it” He became sadder and more quiet. “Are you serious? Are you totally serious? Because if that's true, that's so messed up.”

I nodded. I coudln't speak anymore, the sadness was overwhelming, it was everything to control myself from crying.

“But I love you, I was going to confess to you...we were going to live together....I was going to take you to see my family...”

I ran out, unlike a storm, or a windy day, I ran out and nothing changed. I just ran and ran.

### Chapter Seventy Nine

```
Haha, I don't know if any of you expected that twist coming? It was great fun to write that, I wanted it to come for so long, and it's finally out.

Now for those of you wonderign how much longer Colita's going to be here, and she's overstaying her welcome in us, then you can be relieved, we're building up to two great huge gigantic marvellous climaxes. One is bigger than the the other. Most of the stuff has happened, and the grenades that Matt and Jason are going to blow anytime soon!!!

Hope you enjoyed it and will enjoy the rest as well :)

```


Lacey had a way of splitting the people around her into two peanut butter flavors. Either smooth or crunchy. She said she herself was crunchy, when you ate it, it was mostly smooth, but with unexpected crunchy parts in. So she wasn't a monotonous person, but was brimming with unexpected surprises.

And she told me that I was a boring and smooth person, simple, predictable, and the same.

“But in a good way” she said.

It was easy to call someone else simple and predictable, everyone else had it easier than you, everyone else was suffering less than you. That was how you made yourself feel important.

“Be careful” she said, “I know you need Matt's help for something important to you guys”

“It's not just to us” I said, “It's for everyone, you're going to benefit from it as well”

She looked at me suspiciously, “Yeah right...anyway, he won't do anything for the races. He's like that. Besides, for some reason, I don't know why, he said he hates you guys, angels, I don't know why, don't get me wrong, I like you, a lot. But he despises a lot of things and you seem to be at the top of that list.”

“And what are you going to do next, after this?” she said. We were sitting in one of the music rooms, she was playing piano, because she could, and I was listening, because I could.

“It's to do with what's happening next” I said.

“So what are you doing next? Are you going to get with Nathan?”

I was his Mom, but I couldn't tell Lacey. Even if I did, she wouldn't understand it, few ears in the world would understand such an absurd situation. “No, I can't” 

“Why not? Don't you like him?”

“There's some things that are more important than liking someone” I said.

“Huh, what are you talking about?”
Lacey played some songs that were famous classical pieces by humans who had lived.
“Do you like it?” she said.

“It's beautiful” I said. 

And she smiled, “I learned to play this toy for twelve years now” she said, “So what do you think?”

“It's beautiful” I said.

Nathan barged in the door. He was staring at me. “I have to talk to you. I just read the letter.”

“No you don't then” I said.

“Nathan” Lacey was stunned. “How did you know I could play piano?”
 
He didn't look her way, he only looked at me. “Anyway Mum” he said, “I'm going to call you Mum from now on, not some fake name like Colita. You shouldn't have told me, I spent all my life looking for a mother, and if I knew it was going to be you I wouldn't have bothered. I spent all my life looking at a piece of ice.”

Did he know how hard it was for me to tell him? And did he know Lacey was watching? I turned my head to see her. She was even more stunned into a coma.

“I hate you Mum” he said. “I'm disgraced that I come from an angel” Nathan didn't stop.

Lacey collapsed to the ground. Nathan was crying, “Why did it have to be you? It could be anyone else in the world, I thought my Mom was a good person”

“Nathan” I said, “I am a good person, I know I'm not, but I'm trying, I'm trying my best. Just like everyone else here.”

He shook his head, “That's not good enough, not for my mother”

I sunk on the piano stool. They keys stood unwavering, but I didn't know which ones to touch to do anything what I wanted.

“Who's my father?” he said. “Do you remember him?”

“Nathan, you're important to me, of course I know who your father is. Who do you think I am?”

“So who is it then?”

“It's Max” I said. Then I realized that Nathan didn't know who Max was, “He's the man who was shot by Matt and is in the nursing room now”

Nathan's face dropped, he touched his cheek, then his other one, he looked at his arm, like it was a foreign object that he never realized had been there.

“Why are you saying this now?” he said, “My life was fine, it was betetr if you had never told me”

“Because the further we travel the less we know” I said.

“That old man who's my father, he's a douche isn't he. That's why I'm also such a loser, it all comes from him, no way it came from you, because you're too good for that”


“I love Max dearly” I said, “Because he gave me you, Nathan.”

“I'm a disappointment” he said, “My Dad is an idiot, and my Mom is an angel, I can't believe it. I'm not even worth being a human. I wished all of you would just disappear, you and my father, you're not a part of my life anymore.”

I looked down at the ground, there were circles of wet tears dripping onto the floor from my eyes, recently they were like taps that could never be shut. 

“That's okay” I said, “I can disappear from your life easily but you can't disappear from mine” I stood up, it took courage to say this, “And your father is a great man. Even if you think he's useless. But he isn't just Max, he's also your father, that's why no matter what he does I will protect him, and you. Both of you.” Lacey woke up, on the ground, sprawled over, she didn't look made up at all. She looked like an undressed barbie, except that she was well dressed, and she was much bigger than a barbie. “Don't make me choose between you two”

Nathan left the room. And I left not long after. I think we both had too much to think about, and it was something that had to be sorted through alone.

### Chapter Eighty - Matt The Beast

I discussed it with Max, he made it sound like it wasn't a big deal. “Okay, is that all? Well that's not too bad right? I'm glad our son is such a strong willed person”

“Max, are you listening? Why aren't you hurt by that?”

“You're weak” he said, “You're just like a human woman, they get upset at all sorts of small things as well. You need to learn to be stronger”

That was always his excuse whenever I tried to turn his eyes to the issue at hand.

Now we were talking, the feeling from our date was almost all gone. Now it made it feel like Nathan and Max were both competing for the same spot in my life, rather than two separate spots. That wasn't the way it should be.

“There's going to be a big fight” Max said, “There's a lot of dissatisfied people”

“You better resolve everything with Nathan before it then” I said.

“I will” he said, “Don't worry, he's my son”

“You say that all the time, and you don't do anything”

“We're not even together anymore, why are you bossing me around like that?”

“I'm not bossing you around, I'm just talking okay? Don't spin my words into something else. Besides, we don't have to be together to talk about our son right?”


I wanted to talk to him reasonably, but he just argued back like I was attacking him. Why did it always have to be like this.

“You didn't talk about him for the past fifteen years, now you suddenly mention him, what do you expect?”

“I tried to talk to you about him, I was wondering where he was.”

Max looked me up and down, “Look at you, you're dressed as a seventeen year old girl, what are you even doing? You're the same age as him, I knew it was a mistake to make you come here.”

“Excuse me, you didn't make me go anywhere, I came here of my own accord okay?”	
“Okay, okay, whatever you say”

I put my hands on my hips, “Then you have to go and talk to Nathan”

“So is that what this is about? You just want me to go and talk to him like nothing has changed over all this time. We're not even his parents anymore, we relinquished that right seventeen years ago.”

“Max, you need to talk to him, he told me he loved me, as in romantically, that's why you need to....”

“That's because you're dressing as an attractive girl his age, of course he's going to confess to you, guys will confess to anything that smiles back at them.”

“You're blaming me? You're never even met him, why don't you go and talk to him and see what a great person our son has grown up to be.”

Max shook his head, “He's with humans now, Colita, stop it, you need to let go.”


“No, he loves us, he wants to love his real parents, still”

Max spoke calmly,“Nathan would never protect you even if his life depended on it, he would run away. Because he's a human, and in the end all humans are selfish and unreliable. So if you might risk your life to save them, whether they are important to you or not, don't ever protect them over yourself. Us angels need to support each other”

“I don't believe you”

“Humans and angels are different Colita, very different, trust me”

“No, you're crazy, stop telling me that I'm wrong, you never listen to what I have to say and just live in your perfect world with everything under control.”

“You're crazy” Max said, “You're thinking has gone worse since I let you come here, you're saying whatever you want. Have you been swallowing poison?”


“Why are you accusing me? Can't you just listen to what I have to say?”

“Because that's the only explanation I have for you, are you alright?”


“I'm fine, why are you asking?”


“Because you seem kind of weird” he said, “You seem so different”

“You can't get used to me being different”

The feeling from our date was completely gone now. This was how we had been when we were together, always arguing about everything. We couldn't talk about anything without it becoming a competition of who was right and wrong. That wasn't how it was supposed to be. 

We heard voices down the corridor, Max stood against the wall. He was completely recovered now. But he said he still had bullets in him, he would remove them when he got to Angel.Corp.

The others came down the corridor, and then I greeted them, “Hi, how are you doing” Great, Lacey wasn't there. If she was, it might get awkward quickly. The girls looked at me strangely, to them I was standing with a strange creepy looking old man.

“Don't mind them” Max said, “After you leave it won't matter anymore, they won't think about you.”

But this school was important to me.

“What I'm more concerned about is something you always do” he said. “Just now you were yelling at me, then as soon as your 'friends' come past you're the most friendly vase of flowers to them.” He rephrased it, his jaw moving weirdly, like his teeth were coming loose, “You're a monster to me and the sweetest softest tissue paper to everyone else.”

Then he came closer. I tried to push him away, because it was too intimate, and we had just been arguing. Not everything could be solved with a hug or a kiss or a penetration.

“Don't be so full of yourself, I'm not even going to touch you” Max grabbed my hands and held them with his one hand. I let him squeeze my fingers together with his palm. I was curious what he was going to do now. 

Then he reached around and with one hand unclasped my necklace, it dropped loose and fell to the ground, crackling as it went. The floor wore the decoration in pride. A gemstone had dropped onto it from the sky.

“Careful” I said, “Those things are fragile”

“No” he looked at me, “Apparently not as fragile as you. Aren't you going to ask me why?” he said, “Why I'm taking your necklace?”

I grunted and broke my hands loose, “No, because it's probably a stupid reason anyway”

He laughed, “You're right, it is.”


“What are you doing?” Nathan was standing on the other side watching us, Jason was beside him, and the beast, Matt.

“This old man is up again” Matt said. “And so is the angel”

“She lost her necklace” Nathan pointed to the ground. Jason pulled out a gun lazily, “Which one should I shoot first?”

“Don't shoot Colita” Nathan said. His pockets were also bulging with grenades. He must have gotten them from Jason and Matt.

Jason frowned, he fired and I saw Max collapse. 

“No” I screamed down onto Max, trying to find where he was hit. Max looked back at me, stunned, he still didn't realize what had happened.


Then Matt shouted something and punched Jason. Jason crouched down in pain, “I thought you didn't like him, I shot him for you.” 

The beast tore Jason's gun away and held it in his own hands, then he walked up close, right next to me. I could feel the barrel against my cheek. He roared in rage, calling to all the wild animals.

Then he let loose, his finger twitched, the gun recoiled against my cheek, messing up my hair, and the metal rubbed against my skin and left a mark.

Max exploded in front of me. His chest had a whole in it, I saw the bullet hit the ground he was lying on and bounce back into him, like a trampoline. His body was nothing compared to it.

Matt's finger kept triggering, he growled like a beast, after the gunshot I heard him growl and fire again, and then another growl. It was coming from the depths of him, like his chest was a fire.


He kept firing more and more, my cheek was bleeding, I couldn't hear anything, but right under me Max's chest burst open like a B movie, pieces of him flew everywhere, blood splattered onto me, and onto the gun. Max was looking at me in fear, he was still awake. He tried to move his hands, but Matt just kept shooting and shooting. I only heard the trigger going after the bullets stopped. 

Matt still moved his finger the same way after releasing the gun, then he threw it to the side, his finger still twitching to an imaginary trigger.

Jason fell back, horrified. “Matt, that's enough”

What remained of Max, my only lover, was a mince & cheese pie on the floor.

Matt howled, he literally howled and fell to the ground, sweating. There were pores all over his body, and his nose was soaked from perspiration, his shirt was a wet hole.

Then he wiped the streaks of blood off himself.

I fell over trying to get up, I didn't have any anger, I didn't have any fear, I didn't have any remorse. All I was was uncomfortably numb.

But as I lay there, I saw the blood on me receding, it trickled down my arm and into a pile on the floor, all the blood on Matt as well. Then some skin in my hair fell off and started moving. Pieces of Max on the ceiling also peeled off and all started moving together in a pile towards the body on the ground.

Then it came together and started healing. The body came together, and Max smiled, he stood up as good as new, his suit was untainted by worldly stains.

“Deyjavu” he said. “You don't need to hire a cleaner anymore.”

Matt's eyes widened, in excitement. He trembled in joy, letting every part of him quiver.

Then he turned and pulled out a new gun. He also held a grenade, and they were both aimed at me.

“It's enough, let's go, nothing's happened”

The beast clawed the tip of the gun with his nails, then he pulled the trigger. A bullet started flying straight at Max.

But this time Max spread out his arms and a blue shield came up all around him, like in Dragon Ball Z.

The beast hesitated, he had probably never seen anything like it before. But it was only for a moment, he fired away, the bullets all fell still and dropped to the ground when he shot. The gun became empty and he dropped it. He pulled out a grenade and bit off the safety, then he threw that at Max as well. But it didn't touch him, it didn't stain him and exploded. 

I had no idea Max was this powerful, I knew he had come from the original powerful angels, but nothing this amazing. He was literally like a superman. I was suddenly so proud of him. Maybe what he was saying made sense, maybe I should listen to him more.


“Matt, you can't touch me” he said. “I'm too powerful for you”

The beast scratched the ground, his nails were long. He ran at Max but just bounced back onto the wall. The shield around him was too strong.

“Let me talk to you, if you work with us we can make the world a better place, you'll be famous, if you enjoy those things.”

Matt was not comprehensible, he was a pure beast now. He just kept running at Max and falling down. But Max was trying to talk to him like there was any sense. It was like he was explaining rules to an animal.

Finally Matt sat down on the ground, exhausted.”I'm not going to help you, ever” he said. Then he looked up at Max and then me, and laughed. To him we must have looked desperate.

“What is this cooperation about?” Jason said. “What can Matt do that you guys want?”

Nathan was confused, it must have been hard for him to see this. But when I saw him I really wanted to protect Max even more, because he was Nathan's father. I wanted them to be able to talk to each other sometime soon.

But Matt was only full of hatred,

“You angels are disgusting, all you do is heal people and act like we belong to you, it's none of your business, get out of our life, you're all filthy disgusting wannabe's.” Matt could have kept going, and he did, and I held my ears shut not to listen to him.

I let go of my ears a while later and I heard him still going , “...The way you need to live is not to be so judgmental...”

“We're not all like that” I said, “You can't see one or two angels and clump all of us together into something that you hate, that's not smart, that's base. We need to be noble”

No one listened to my words, Matt just kept talking, “You're just a disgusting thing, only good for sex, and you're not good at that either. You shouldn't have been born...”

I looked at Max, he had his huge shield around him, but I couldn't go in it either, it was all for himself. To protect him from the whole outside world.

I was part of the outside world as well.

“Max, help me” I said, still holding my ears, letting out a plea for help.


Matt stared straight at me, then swore at me, I didn't hear him say it, but he said it so loud that his lips were clear in their intentions. “You're an angel, you're a f****** angel.” 

I looked at Matt, what he was saying was horrible. Couldn't Max do anything? But I saw Max looking back at Matt through the shield. It stayed strong and solid, protecting him from everything.

But Max's face was riddled with fear, he didn't dare do anything. His eyes met mine and I saw that he was even more afraid of Matt than I was...

### Chapter Eighty One - Max the father.

```
I'm sorry if the last chapter was brutal, and if you didn't think it was, then it was okay?  Matt is a complete and utter beast, he's unreasonable and they cant' talk to him.

It wasn't that Max was choosing not to help. He was too afraid to do anything. This paralysis consumed his body like a cancer. 
```

“I can't help you sorry” Max was discouraged. “This human was just too violent to talk to.” He was still being protected by his shield.

Just in a spur of the moment, Max threw away our whole mission like a disposable nappy. He wouldn't try anything, he was afraid that Matt might do something to him. When it really came down to it, Max was as useful as wings were to a Kiwi bird.

“It's such a pity” I said, “That the fate of our whole race has to be placed in the hands of someone like you. You're not worthy of being human. You're not even worth a space in this world.

“Stop” Max said, “Don't say anything Colita, don't make him angry”


Matt couldn't touch Max and he knew it, so he turned to the next target, me. He raised his gun and pointed it straight at my left eye, then alternated to my right, and kept it moving.

“Which side of your face is your favourite?” he said.

I saw Nathan, and I suddenly had a strong will to survive. And protect Max as well. He was Nathan's father, the two of them should meet.

“Leave us alone” I said, by us, I didn't mean just Max and me, I meant everyone in the world that I saw. Every single person that I loved and cared for. He should just leave everything and go.

Nathan was staring at me.

I crossed my hands and stood in front of Max. I had to do what he couldn't, to stand up to this monster dressed as a human. I didn't want to think he was a human, no human could do this to another living creature, regardless of their race or culture or abilities. We were all alive right now.

“Matt, it's all over now, finish it”

Max screamed as Matt fired his gun at me, straight for me. 

I would just become more pieces of window screen rubbish on his shield.

### Chapter Eighty Two

```
That was a short chapter, but there was a reason for it, so take a breather as we dive back into what happened with Matt's life to make him the way he is. 
This story is coming to a close guys, I think I can finish it in a few more days, and then I'm going to be focusing on a heist story, so maybe see you all there...I don't know how...but maybe yeah?

My life situation is changing, so the story keeps changing, but I'm trying to keep it as true to it as I can.

Well, here goes. Thanks a lot guys. I don't know how many more thanks there are going to be, so make that one mean extrahaha.

> CHAPTER THE BACKSTORY of Matt

“Colita” Julia said.

                                                                                                               “Colita”


“Colita”

“Yeah?” I answered. When she said it in my left ear I could hear it well.

“I thought you were asleep” she said, “You were so quiet”

“No, I was just watching Matt” I said.

“Matt?” Julia was stunned, “The beast? You'd better not look at him, he's Lacey's property. He's not for sale. His price is more than the price of the limb to replace the one you lost trying to get him.” What she was saying was a fancy way of discouraging me.

I wondered what he would think of me if he knew I was an angel sent to check on him and watch over him. It was kind of romantic, I didn't know the guy but he wasn't bad looking.

So at lunch I went up to his table when Lacey was off getting her lunch. I sat down super quickly, Lacey was standing in line, but she caught sight of me and I could see her fuming like Rangitoto volcano, but she didn't want to jump out of line to get to me.

“What is your favorite race of people?” I said.

He didn't hesitate, “I like all humans” It was one of the first things I had ever heard him say. It was only my third day at school.

“Then how about what races you dislike?”

“That's easy” he said, “I dislike angels, I dislike them so much that I hate them, they're like so stupid creatures that I completely despise.”

“Okay” I nodded and rolled my eyes. But then a few hours later I saqw him and got curious again. How come this human had such strong feelings for angels, he had to have some experience with them, otherwise he wouldn't go around saying that. So next chance I got, I asked him again, why he disliked angels in particular.

“It's because I hate them so much that I want to obliterate them off the earth.”

That wasn't really an answer, it was more of a restatement of what he said earlier. “Why are you willing to obliterate them off the face of the earth?”

“Why do you care?” he said, “No one's ever asked me these questions before, so what does it matter to you”

“If no one's asked you these questions before then why have you thought of them?” I said, “If you never thought of them before then you would be clueless in your answers.

“I guess so” he said. “Are you an angel?”

“What, why?” I could never lie.

“Because only an angel would ask me the questions you're asking me, a human wouldn't because they wouldn't care.”

“I just want peace for all” I said, “For all the beings in the world”

“There's an easy fix for that, a simple one” he said, “It's to get rid of all the stupid and nonsensical and selfish people in the world. They only ruin it and destroy it for everyone else.”

“That's horrible, don't say that, everyone is worth a lot” I said.

He went on with what he was saying, “But how do you decide who to get rid of? Who gets to decide? Everyone's going to keep themselves. So in the end we're all the same, we all protect ourselves, so in that way the world is already equal, the longer it runs for, the more equal it gets, because more people in the world means more equilibrium and less differences, the consensus is larger.

“That's not equality, that's giving up”

“But what if we let the poor people have a better time by giving them money, giving the handicapped people money, all the angels live the same as humans, that's not equality, that's just turning a blind eye to the problem by pretending to solve it. Because nothing is equal in this world. You're an idiot to think that.”

“But I want equality” I said. 

“If everyone is equal, then nothing ever changes, how can you express yourself in a world like that? What if one person always complains about everything you say, they always get upset about it. What are you going to do then?”


“It all depends” I said. “On who is doing it”

“In the end, it all depends” he said, “That's what you're always going to say.”

“Did you have a bad experience with angels?”

“See? You're an angel, that's why you're asking me this s*** that no one else cares about. Don't even pretend.”

“No, I'm just curious that's all” There was no bigger lie, and I felt bad saying it, but I really wanted to know.

“Did an angel do something to you?”

Then Lacey came over with her mostly empty lunch tray, and I moved away before she could sparkle her insect repellent spray in my eyes.

I later thought about what he said for ages afterwards, I analyzed it from every angle, but I didn't know why he said those things. Was he just making it up? Where did his dislike of angels come from?
Did I have a crush on him? I wonder why he didn't have a crush on me, did he ever? Was it because I was less valuable after being touched by him before already? Was it because I had already had a kid?

“Careful” Matt said, over Lacey's chortles at him, “If you're an angel, I'm going to hunt you down”

I shivered and walked, shivered and walked, then smiled. 

“You're was the one who talked about angels so much, I'm so suspicious now”

BACKSTORY END

### Chapter Eighty Two

```
Haha, I know that wasn't much of a backstory, it's just that I wanted everything to come from Colita's perspective. But the point was just to show that maybe Colita was herself the one who made everyone suspect she was an angel. 
Anyways sorry, I'm just rushing to finish the story now, because it's become a bit of the past....

Now we see Nathan and the family reunited....for a short time. It's a bit sad, so I'm sorry...
Then the FINAL battle will come underway and unravellllllling!!!

Thanks as always, 

Kevin
```


I wasn't hit by the bullet, Nathan had jumped in front of me to take it. It took me a while to realize what happened. 

My son had taken a bullet for me. He fell to the ground, his knees crushing my necklace that had been removed by Max. “Nathan, are you okay? Talk to me, say something, anything. Where does it hurt?”

Matt dropped his gun. “It's a human, I shot a human...It's Nathan, I shot Nathan”

“Don't worry” Jason said, “You don't need to step in, Colita can heal him. Don't worry. Colita?”

Everyone was just using my powers as they wished, like I was a hotel. But I couldn't heal anymore, I had no necklace. I moved Nathan's knee and dug my necklace out, it  was crumbled.

“Where did that blue glass come from?” Jason said.

Nathan was in pain, but he tried to speak, slowly and calmly. “Colita is the kindest person” he said. “She's the kindest person of everyone I know, and so considerate of everyone around her, she always took care of me. She loves humans more than humans do. She's the greatest person I know”

I held him in my arms, tears were streaming down my eyes, down my hair and getting fuzzled on my lips. “Nathan don't go, don't leave me here” I said.

“Heal him” Jason said, “We already know you're an angel”

Matt pointed the gun at me, “Heal the human, now”

I looked up at Max, “Can you heal him?” I said. Max's lips trembled, “I can't heal a human” he said, “It's against the rules” His eyes settled on Matt, and even his hands started shaking. He was overcome by fear, and in that moment I knew that he was seeing one more figure with us. Death. It had come to visit him again.

Even the thickest shield wouldn't protect him from that.

Nathan coughed up some blood and stood up. He clasped his shoulder in pain, I rolled him over and tried to get him some medical attention.

“Get away from him” Max said, “Colita, us angels need to stick together” Max could say all he wanted, but he didn't take a step closer to me or to Nathan, he stood far away and spoke.

But I couldn't trust someone who stood so far away. I looked down at my son, squirming to stay alive, and I couldn't do anything. He had been the closest to me, yet I wasn't able to do anything for him.

What was wrong with him? Why was he hurting himself for me? Lacey said that Nathan wasn't someone who could protect someone else if his life depended on it, she said that, but now Nathan was lying on the ground groaning in agony under the immense pain crawling over him. I knew that he had been willing to die for me then.

My own son. What could I do to ever repay him.

After Max took away my necklace then I had nowhere to go. I couldn't go back to Angel.Corp, I couldn't go anywhere with humans. 

I was a fallen angel. 

I was literally standing still in the spot where I lost my necklace, while everyone around me kept moving around me. Walking around, they were all fine while I felt so bad and my son was lying on the ground.

“Leave him Colita, run, right now!” Max said. He didn't come closer, but he wanted me to run.

“Do you not recognize him?” I said. “Heal him”

“Run” Max said, “These guys are dangerous”


He was utterly clueless, he could only see his own life in front of him. Another life was too much consideration for him. I didn't care if I was shot now, I didn't care if I fell asleep to never wake up.

“Who is that? Is it someone I should know?” Max sounded confused, “It's not Matt right?”

To him there were only two types of humans, Max and everyone else. His own son had long ago faded away.

“Colita, run” Max begged, “I don't want to lose you” Max held his belt and pulled out a gun, “Step away from him and run away, before you get shot as well”

Jason crouched down beside me to take care of Nathan. He spoke to him softly, “Are you okay? You have to be okay. We'll get you to the doctor's.”

“I told you” I said, “I told you so many times but you never listened.” I hugged Nathan and shouted at Max. 

“Run away” Max shouted, “Colita, I love you so run away”

I hugged Nathan, trying to stop his bleeding arm, his breathing was slower now, a lot harsher and weak. His laughter wasn't there, and he wasn't saying any dirty jokes or inappropriate things.

“Heal him” Matt shouted, “One of you, heal him right now” He waved his gun around like it was a pen. “If you heal him I won't shoot you”

“Colita, run, they're going to shoot you”

“Heal this boy” I said. “Quickly before he dies”

“He's just another human” Max said, “It's none of our business okay? He's not an angel”

“I told you” I shouted, “I told you so many times but you wouldn't listen, I wanted you to meet him”

Then I heard a gunshot, when I realized it I was fine, but I looked down and saw Nathan's chest with a fresh hole. Instantly blood started to swell up and flood over the skin, riveting down the sides, escaping into the cold air.

I looked over to Matt, but Matt shook his head, then I didn't dare, but I looked to Max. Behind his blue shield he held a gun in his hand, it was pointed at Nathan. “I'm saving you” he said,  “Run away now. Us angels aren't allowed to heal others withotu approval, but there's no rule that says we can't remove someone.”

Although I had talked about Nathan so much, Max still didn't know who he was. I couldn't believe him, I didn't care about him anymore. His selective hearing was beyond belief. Everything I had told him, he had just dismissed it as fleeting and unimportant, obsolete and antique. Did he even listen to anything that I had to say?

“This is Nathan” I said. “Remember Nathan? The Nathan I was telling you about?”


“I never heard” he said, “You never told me”

“Yes I did, I told you a zillion billion million times who our son was, what he looked like, and you shot him dead. You shot him f****** dead!”

“I was only trying to protect you” Max dropped his gun, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can still heal him now, I'm very powerful, I have the power, it's not too late yet.”

Jason was shocked, he didn't know what was happening. And even Matt hesitated. Max crouched on the ground and crawled over to Nathan and I, like a slug that had eaten too much.

“Nathan seems like a really good kid, so yeah umm...he seems really nice and all.
 He didn't have much to say about him, about his own son. He knew his as much as the summer knew falling leaves

“Did you know he wasn't supposed to protect me? Lacey said so” I said, “You didn't know that, you didn't know anything. But he still protected me, even when he knew he didn't have to.” I stroked his hair, hoping Max would heal him soon. I wanted to hear his voice again, and his breathign and his laughter.

Then Nathan said “Mum” to me, and suddenly Max realized it all. He half ran towards us, trying to get here to heal Nathan.


“I saw you standing for my father, and I wanted to do the same.” he said, “I wanted to stand for someone who belonged to me.

I couldn't answer, tears had swallowed my voice.


Then before Max made it over, Matt took the opportunity of Max out of his shield and shot him. The sound rang across the hallway, as loud as a howling monkey, but I was no longer frightened of it. 

I had heard enough bullets lying today.


Guns never told the truth.

Max fell a few steps in front of me, he was breathing hard, barely able to turn over, he craned his neck and looked up to me and Nathan. I was sobbing and choking on my tears now. Nathan was barely conscious.

Then Matt shot again. I heard his gun blast.

I was so close to being able to change it. But my necklace lay crushed under Nathan's knee. In a twist of fate, after I had lost my necklace I was also a human. But no humans here recognized me.

It was ironic because I had so many other places to go to, I was an angel, not a human. So why was I in the middle of this human war? For the first time I realized how it must be to be human, to see a loss and not be able to do anything about it? 


I was suffering so much, I never knew it but I was. The only thing that could save me was music. My headphones hit my ears like a wall of shells, I let them dump their s*** in my ears, feeding them with companionship. 

Angel Beats Soundtrack:

The alarm clock is ringing nonstop,
Please let me sleep just a little more,
Yesterday at Owagigu,
and then afterwards at the party,
Of course I can't drink alcohol,
But of course it was juice,

Living through these busy days with an air of seriousness,
If you could give this girl a little bit of sleep...
If you come over here properly, then I'll let you listen to my new song
Of course hikitatari de
Tetori ashitori I will tell you,
Oh right, one guitar string was broken,

I couldn't bear to see Max go. But I also couldn't do anything about it. If I played the music loud enough and for long enough, maybe I wouldn't hear this anymore. This world spinning and turning and inverting and trying to shake us all off.

I turned around and did what I did best, run. 

Turn the volume up,

The alarm clock, I've got thirty minutes because I'm a young woman
Seriously, I know I need to get up already,
Even if the mid-winter futon leaves a lot of space,
I can't sneak out anywhere, I have been cursed by sleep.

The modern society that we live in, in this kind of place I couldn't believe there was a demon.
because of nonsense, Kusuu nante kidokunai,

Maybe it's going to become more interesting from here right?
That's why even if you say a continuation, 
I can't picture it at all

So right now I may as well just be eaten up by my futon and become a monster.
Whoah, woah. That's good enough isn't it?.

Come on, come on, it's time to wake up now.
Please put the water on to boil.
The wake up coffee and the half eaten cookie.

That's right, I was supposed to be a serious person.
Anyway, I was by myself, so I wonder who I was talking to?

Living while cracking apart.

### Chapter Eighty Three

```
I don't know what you thought of that, but it was...eventful in the very least. And that song, I'm sorry fi the lyrics didn't come through, in japanese it makes sooooo much more sense, but in English it's just like a funny joke, and it's only funny because it's supposed to be a song!!! But you get the point, it's about a lot of normal daily things, except, they all mean so much more than daily life, right? AT least that's what I think, in my humble opinion.
 
So....moving on...(awkward silence)...

I think this chapter's going to be interesting (as well, if you enjoyed the last one) :) You might even love it and ask for a number? Haha sorry for the absolute lameness. 
Following is a look into what happened with Colita, and maybe how she became the way she is now, and the contemporary nurturing environment of a young angel.

Thanks,
```

> Chapter the Backstory of Colita                       



“Let her try it on, it might work”

I remembered sitting there, adults were all around me with hands touching me, for every strand of my hair there was a finger. 

“Don't give it to her, it's not a good life”

One lady looked at me with huge eyes, the size of my whole face. She leaned in and stared, and I cried and tried to push away from the monster.

“She's short, and she's got a weird bone structure” More hands touched me, wiping my hair away and commenting. “She's really tall and slim, and more than a little haunted”

“Give it to her, let her see, she has no parents anyway”

“Let her decide if she wants it”

“How can she decide if she wants to be human? She can't even speak like a human, she can't even nod like a human, she can only cry like a human.”


“But she can do all those things like an angel?”

“It's not her decision if she wants to be an angel or not”


A necklace came into my view, it had a blue crystal on it. “This one's called Lola” they put it around my neck. It was so big that it hung down to my legs. It weighed my body down like a chain, restricting my movement.

“It's big on her”

“She'll grow into it, and then one day it will fit her perfectly.” 

Then I heard laughter around me, the blue stone started to glow, like it was born for me.

“Give her to the agency, she's an angel.”

One lady crouched down in front of me, “Hello” Her voice was in the friendzone, she hugged me and sat down to be level with me. “We need to tell you something now, it's about being an angel okay?”

“Don't bother, she's not listening anyway, she doesn't hear you, she's dumb”

“No, you have to tell every angel this, it's part of their rights, that's what I was told about angel induction.”

“She's a human girl, not an angel, just two minutes ago she was a human, so stop treating her differently already.”

“She's an angel now though, look, the thing is still glowing.”

“She doesn't have any parents okay? She doesn't have anyone.”

The woman who was sitting brought out a book and flipped a few pages, then she put her finger down and looked at me. “This is important” she said, “So please try and remember this.” She looked around her at the other people. The fingers aroundme instantly retreated like a coral releasing its grip on something.

Her voice was as transparent as a glass window. It let everything flow through, “The path of an angel is a unique one. It isn't for everyone, it's to be able to do actions without getting any credit for them. It's to walk the path so far ahead that you are invisible to others.”

“That's just BS, this whole thing is nonsense, no one wants to be an angel.”

“Shh, stop it, let me finish. It's to walk the path so far behind everyone else that you catch the strugglers but never see the group itself. Angels are never part of the herd, they're meant to help them, it's a great role in human society. No one is subservient to another. Like the rats in a human society who always scurry around.”

“Be serious, you've finsihed right? Let's go”

The woman looked at me, she was worried. “Little girl” she said, “You have a long life ahead of you, now that you're an angel all sorts of things are going to happen, you will see more than you can handle a lot of the time. So you have to be serious. But don't worry, you'll learn to act a certain way with everyone.”

“Let's go, are you done? She'll be fine, come on.”

They all left, all the fingers around me were gone. And I was left alone there. I was lying on the ground, staring at the roof. The necklace had stopped glowing, it sat still like a leopard.

But it would glow for the rest of her life.

### Chapter Eighty Four

```
So, after doing that one, I feel kind of sad. It's not her fault, it's got nothing to do with her, but why does she have to go through all of this?

Sorry, 

Kevin
```

Violence suddenly came out of nowhere. It rose like the sun in the sky and fell when the moon rose.

There were two types of actions in the world, those that were unsure... And those that were...sure. When I smoked, I was unsure, that's why I did it. But when I did my homework, I was sure. When I talked to Max I was sure. And when I smiled, I was sure.


The two acts always needed to be balance out to create a good equilibrium. And the way frustration was balanced, was through acts of aggression. 

I saw Matt crouch down over Max and move his around like a mannequin. On the corner of the wall was a sharp stain of blood and pieces of Max's shirt that had stuck to the wall.

I looked away, when I turned back, Max was collapsed in front of me. I screamed and looked away, when I looekd back Max was still the same, but he was looking at Nathan now. He couldn't speak but I knew what he thought. He slowly moved an arm around himself, he brought out a knife and tried to pull it on himself, but he barely had the strength for that.


Suicide was the ultimate act of unsurity, of uncertainty. It was hesitation.
 
Matt laughed uncontrollably. “This angel's dying” he said, “He was moving just now, but soon he's going to stop. I'm sure of it.”

The Ultimate act of surity.

“Violence” Matt said, he pumped another round of bullets into Max, he looked like the carborator of a car.


“Go on, struggle more” He laughed when we struggled, he laughed when we tried to laugh at him and get the better of him. He genuinely didn't care. This was all entertainment for him.

By now Matt had literally shot Max so many times that there was more bullet than flesh inside Max. Max was starting to look like a gun cartridge. If he coughed too hard he spat out bullets, and when he laughed you could hear bullets clanging and rolling around in his guts. He pooped metal bullets into the toilet.

“Please don't hurt my son, and Colita” Max wailed, he didn't have the strength to move, even an angel like him couldn't heal himself anymore. He saw his fate unwind in front of him. All of his running. 

Now he was really going to die. He screamed with all his might, but even that became tiring, then he just stared into space. Matt watched every second like it was the final episode of a TV drama.

“You can't speak?” he said. “Why don't you try and speak? I'm listening”

“I'm sorry, english is your second language” Matt says. “I know english like a grenade knows to scream”

Max's life disappeared, he couldn't do anything now except face the end.

Then the most scary thing appeared. I watched as he screamed one last time, and I think I heard the grim reaper's laugh.

The last sound Max ever heard.

---

### Chapter Eighty Five, Or the LAST :)

```
Yup, so this is not really the last chapter, but it's one before the last one. Believe it or not, we've come such a far way. Thank you for reading this far. For all of you dedicated fans out there I'll leave a final message, at the very end. It's just some personal comments...

From here the structure is going to change, just a bit. The last chapter is going to be hectically long, so long that it's a rope. It's split into comprehensive mini-chapters. Part I, 2,3,4,5 etc.

For example, Part I will be something about someone who did something.
And then Part II will be something about someone else who did something else.


And so on...

SO here goes

Thanks again :)
```

Or so that's what we thought. Max turned around and rolled over, he wasn't dead, he had blood gushing through his lungs, and he was so full of holes that anyone might use him as a siv. 

His necklace was glowing so strongly that Jason looked up at the sky to see if the moon was still there.

“I'm not going to let you do this” Max was healing himself, he was so effective that he was starting to look less like lasagna, and more like Max.

“Max” I said, “I recognize you now, I didn't realize you were Max.” I was grateful that he was fine. But Matt wasn't, he was out of bullets and knives and grenades. He turned to Jason for reinforcements, but Jason shook his head.

“You already destroyed him twice” Jason said, “Haven't you had enough? Let's let him go”

“I'm fine” Max said, “I'm invulnerable” He stood up. The bullets in him clanged.

“Can you heal Nathan?” I said. “He's not invulnerable”

Max looked down at our son, then at me.

LAST: part II

Max looked down, at Nathan sprawled on the ground, his breathing was barely audible, he was holding his chest, his eyes were open but they didn't see.

“I only have enough energy for one more revive” Max said. He looked at his necklace glowing, he fumbled with it, putting it in the right place.

“You're safe” I said, “Heal our son, please, for me.”

Max crossed his arms, he had put the necklace back in his suit. “Are you sure?” he said, “Are you sure this is our son?”

“It's Nathan, and he's at this school, and he never met his real parents”

“There's a lot of Nathan's in the world”

“So what, this is our son! Even if he isn't it's a human dying, can't you heal him?”

Max shook his head, “The rules are rules, even if it's for my son, I can't”

“Now it's rules? Can't you see we're going to lose our son? It's our son Nathan, how can rules be more important than that?”

“I'm sorry” Max said, he stepped back. “I can't heal him”

LAST: part 3

I remember one time I was travelling along the beach on a bus. It was a beach ninety miles long in the human world, and on it were all sorts of animals. But we never saw animals, they were mostly living under the water. 

Except, there was one baby seal, it was on the shore stranded, and our bus went past. We stopped the bus right next to it, and we all got off to look at the seal.

“You can't touch it” the driver said. “We're not allowed to interfere with the nature, we'll just take a look before getting back on the bus.”

The baby seal was timid, it didn't know what was happening around it. Why people were here all the time. It didn't realize that us humans thought we were lucky to be able to see it here. At least, that's what I thought.

“I think it's sick” one of the tourists with us said. “It's moving its head in a weird way, like its coughing”

The seal was moving its head in a weird way. And before we realized it, it collapsed on the ground, just breathing.

“It's dying” one of the girls ran forward. But her mother held her back, 

“Darling don't interfere with nature”

We only watched it for a bit longer before getting on the bus. We couldn't do anything. We could only stand around it and be awkward.

“That's nature, thanks for respecting the seal, and nature” the bus driver said. I didn;t know what happened to the seal. But maybe an angel found it and healed it up to full health and threw it in a pokeball to make it a slave to a so-called 'trainer' for the rest of its life.

LAST: part 4

“Tomorrow” Matt said. “I want to finish everything with you tomorrow. 

“I only wish to discuss with you” Max said. His shield was up and an air of seriousness surrounded him. “This is about the future of both of our races, a diplomatic mission.”

“I don't care about any missions” Matt said. He held his gun straight at Max, it was empty, we all knew that.

“It's empty Matt” Jason said, “Put it down” 

Then Max asked a question I was always curious about. “Why are you doing this?” he said. “What makes you hate angels so much?”

Yes! I felt like yelling in joy, he finally had some sense in him. He was finally thinking. But he also wasn't thinking about our son at all.

“I lost the girl I loved” Matt had to think about it, but he answered.

“So that's why you;re hurting all of us? Is this your vengeance? What does it have to do with angels?”

I was curious too.

“I loved Julia” Matt said, the way he spoke made it sound like it was his first time saying this, they were virgin words. “And she died”

“So what?” Max said, “Is that why you're attacking us angels? That doesn't make any sense”

“It's because I really loved her okay? You dont know anything so don't accuse me” Matt was in hysterics, he saw our reactions and laughed harder.

“Who is Julia?” I said, “Did she go to this school?”

Everyone stared at me, even Max, even the dead Nathan.

Jason finally spoke, “Colita, are you serious? Wasn't she your best friend?”

Oh wow, I had almost forgotten...that girl was Julia...but they were all staring at me as if I had committed the biggest offence of all. “I'm just joking, calm down guys” I turned it on Matt, “Is she the reason you're doing all of this?”

Even while I was asking, I felt guilty for forgetting about her for a moment there. I didn't know how long she had disappeared for, had she been disappearing more often? How long had she been gone for before just now? Then I remebered the rest of Julia and how kind she was. Is that why Matt raped Julia in front of everyone? Was that Matt's way of showing affection?

“Why did you do those things to her if you liked her?” I said, “Why didn't you save her?”

Everyone stared at me again.

“Colita, I was just joking” he said, “I made it up on the spot, of course it's not true”

I saw his expression loosen, it wasn't serious at all. I had become excited over nothing. We talked talked talked and he just made it up on the spot.

“So what's the reason?” Max said.

Matt looked up, “There's no reason, why doe sthere have to be a reaosn for everything? Freddie Mercury never had a reason for anything, he just did it, he was a man of spontaneity.”

“You're not a Freddie and you're not Mercury, you're just a highly violent criminal with grandiose delusions”

“I'm a purist” he said. “I want to eliminate all non-pure beings.” He clapped his hands, and pointed at Max, for three seconds. “Anyway, I will challenge you tomorrow. Tomorrow we will settle everything.Meet here at this time tomorrow for a final showdown.” 

“I only want to cooperate with you” Max said, “We're not looking for a showdown.”


Matt stared straight back at him, “Just make sure you come here, at this time tomorrow”

LAST: part 5

“Max, what's wrong with you” I could speak to him because Matt left.

“Here we go again” Max let his shield fall. “I'm so glad you survived that”

“Why didn't you save Nathan, why didn't you save our son?”

He turned away with a sigh, “Because I'm a jealous man” he said.

Jealousy? Where did he spout all of this crap from? 

“I saw what you did” he said, “You thought I was never watching you?”

“What are you talking about”

“Letting all the guys use your body for a bit of pleasure is one thing” he said, “But letting our son use your body for pleasure, that's different all together.” his words echoed in my mind like a boom box, “You're disgusting. Everything but sex with him”

“Since when do you care about what I do?”

“I always did.”

“Did you care when we broke up as well? Is that why you broke up with me.”

“I made a mistake” he said. 

“Well all you do is make mistakes” I said, “And besides, if you actually cared for our son, you would want to protect him, and you would let me die, not him”

He thought about it, I knew he thought about it because he couldn't look at me, he could only look at the floor. A man was weak at heart, that's why every other part of him had to be strong to make up for it.

“I made a mistake” he said, “I didn't realize, it was you...”

“Exactly” he always used the same excuse, he didn't realize, or he forgot, or he made a mistake, I was tired of it. I lost my son because of his disorganization.


“It's also because he wasn't an angel” he said.

“He's not an angel?” I made him know that his words were a mistake the moment he said them.

“What's with your attitude?” he said, “Calm down”

“I am calm, I'm more calm than marijuana grass.” I groaned, it was pain, physically coming out of my body, I coudln't hold it in any longer for this useless guy. “You let our son die because he's not an angel? Because he's a human?”

“Well what do you think? Can you love a human child the same as you love an angel child?”

He was a complete idiot. It didn't matter what race our son was and it wasn't supposed to. Why couldn't he look past something as useless as that?

“I need to take a dump” he said,”To get rid of all these bullets in me”

“Okay” I said, “You go do that bye bye”

LAST: part 6

The Final Showdown: Max's Death/Finish:
<< MOZART REQUIEM: DIES IRAE, LACRIMOSA >>

I sat in the corner of the roof area. The cleaner had closed it off from the general public, but the yellow tape lay sprawled across the floor. People kept coming in and coming in. Everyone had heard about the final showdown. The whole school came. Mr. Gilbert brought his class for a field trip. So did Mrs. Empathy, and so did every other teacher. The students ahd notebooks in their hand, they had to watch us and answer some questions worth some points in their books. One girl was too tall, and her hair stuck out, she had trouble finding place to put her notepad. In the end she settled it 
on one of her classmate's back.

I huddled in the corner trembling. I didn't want this to happen. Why did these men have to always have fights about everything, why couldn't they talk about ti and settle it. Blood should stay in the body, not out of it.


Max was the first to arrive, everyone heard his boots tapping up the stairway, they sounded weavy and weary. He came up prepared with guns hanging all over him, ohis boots were thick leather, and he had a bulletproof vest on. In his hands he held a huge bazooka. Something so large that it could probably be tracked as a nuclear weapon by the military.

Max looked around cautiously, and he stepped out tof the stairwell. He walked to the center and set the bazooka down.

What was he thinking, bringing a weapon like that into this school? He may as well have brought a rocket launcher or a battleship, or arranged for an air drop.

But Matt had been waiting for him, Max poked his head out from behind the bazooka, he came out to look around, then he went back in behind it. Like a snail looking out of its shell.

Matt was wearing normal clothing. The normalest clothing, his uniform was stained a bit in parts from the dinner spaghetti. He rocked up in sandals, so casually, like it wasn't the last battle of his life. 

Even two wrestlers would have less tension between them though. Gladiators could become a laughign stock compared to the intense dislike these two harboured for each other.

Max was an angel, he wasn't supposed to manifest negative things to others. We were supposed to be peacekeepers right?

The two didn't talk, Matt pressed a button and the huge bazooka that was so heavy that it tilted the floor and brought cracks in, it exploded. It lit up like a firework and exploded in the sky into a thousand shooting stars.

Matt started laughing, when the explosion died down I saw him, and then I heard him after everything faded, he was craning back and forth and laughing so hard.he had meticulously planned it.

I looked around for Max but there was no sign of him. He had disappeared, vanished. Not even his remains were there. It was just a black patch on the ground, a crater around where the bazooka had been.

The teachers looked at their students and made them write, the students were scribbling so much, their hands ached and their pens bled.

Matt was still laughing ten minutes later. Then out of the sky a hard rock came falling, it fell so fast, and straight down. It was a blue rock, it hit the ground and crumbled into a thousand pieces.

It was Max's. 

“I never thought it would be that big” Matt said. “Or that it would be this easy.”

I couldn't believe it, did this mean that Max was gone? Colita and Colessa can't believe it.

Then just as I was about to lose hope, for the third time, Max resurfaced. He floated up from behidn the students. They screamed in fear, he was wrapped up by a strong blue shield. “My armor is impenetrable” he said. “My reign is supreme”, “My anger is unquenchable”

I was happy to see him, but unhappy that he said those things. Hadn't he learned anythign from that encounter?

“I'm prepared” Max said. “My ego is uncontrollable, my generosity is peaceful” 


Then Matt put down his left hand where he had the button, and he started loading guns. Max had no weapons, so he strengthened his shield. The two walked towards each other.


“I'm not going to attack you” Max said, “I'm a peaceful person”

Jason halted, but Matt didn't. He shot with no remorse, so many shots. Bang Bang bang bang bang, all echoing around the chambers. Even though he was a terrible shot, only about 20% hit, Max fell, his HP dropped below recovery. There were no potions nearby. 

Matt cocked the gun, shot, then when it emptied he reloaded it,. He fired with one eye shut, he was a terrible shot, but the sheer number of bullets was threatening.

Max hid behind his shield, it made the bullets drop stop and dance. “Stop shooting” he cried over the sound of the bullets, “Let's make a peace treaty, you can have all of the angels, if you impregnate them, just like you said, those are our terms”

Matt was in a play fight, he was in a tease. He frowned when the bullets were empty and brought out a new packet, like a pack of cards, he slid them in the cartridge and ejected them to Max.

It was all a game to him. He kept shooting, and Max blocked everything with his shield. I was surprised to see his strength. But I was more surprised by the sheer amount of violence Matt had to dish out. 

Was it because he wanted to feel relevant? Was it because he was too strong? Who knew.

Then out of nowhere, in the crowd there were screams, and Jason's sister Joyce ran in, she ran straight for Matt yelling for him to stop. Matt didn't hesistate, he looked over the smoke emanating from the gun and pointed it at her shooting a few, before shooting Matt.

Joyce fell over awkwardly, one leg falling under the other, and she started leaking blood. She tried to cover herself up, but there were no bandaids big enough to block arteries.

Then Nathans' sister came in from the same place in the crowd and was mowed down by Matt as well. He just focused on Max, but if there was any other movement he took them out as well. She fell to the ground, crying and screaming in pain, but not for long, a second stray bullet hit her in the back and she stopped.

Then the kid from the stars ran past, Julia's brother, he wasn't even trying to protect anyone, he just ran past, and then was randomly shot by the bullets. He was yelling something and still running from death when it happened. Then he fell over in front of us, he had so many holes in him that he had leaked out flat and become a carpet.

I saw Julia's Mom standing on the side watching everything taking place in shock.

Lacey's sister Mel was wearign uniform, she was like an armed bull full of rage and trying to absolve the situation. Matt hesitated for a moment when he saw her, he probably didn't attack her because he thoguht she was still good looking. She was still young.

But then he thought better and let out fire, to get her out of the way,. Lacey screamed, but I held her back. The wind was blowing across my face, and I held Lacey back with all my might. “You can't go in there, you're only going to get killed”

“But Matt knows me, and my little sister!”

“Right now Matt will shoot anyone”

She sighed and fell down.


I saw Mrs. Empathy at the exit, she had a family to go home to, so she didn't get involved and closed the door of the roof and let things 'settle' themselves out. Like dust being cleaned up naturally. Her vase was also in a vulnerable position, the already broken antique could potentially get shot at.

I crouched down, holding Lacey's hair in front of her, and covering her eyes. We were in the crowd now, and people all around us were staring and taking notes, and afraid, and excited, and inspired. I remembered when I was young, how people didn't want me to see certain things, but I had, and maybe that was why I had turned out this way.


“Listen Lacey, I want you to close your eyes no matter what happens, and I will shelter you in the corner while these guys sort everything between them out.” I held her eyes tight, and she sobbed into them. My hands felt all her tears trickle through my fingers, I tried to hold them in, I didn't want her to realize how much she was facing this, but hands couldn't hold water. They weren't meant to. The cuts on my hand stung from the salt emitting from her.

When all failed Matt silently took out his right hand, there was an even bigger button in his palm, it hardly fit, it was the size of an apple injected with syringes and cylinders of hormones.

It was violence. I realized it the moment he held it.

Before anyone could say anything, Matt's finger pressed down,. At that moment in time, that one muscle that controlled that part of his thumb was the most important muscle.

Max couldn't recover. He didn't know where the explosion came from, but all of us saw that it was from inside him. It was like a volcano from the center of the earth, none of us had ever seen something so inhumane and slimy, it wasn't what was supposed to be in a human.

He was hurt beyond recovery, a spray of him landed on everyone. Like sprinklers being let off in a crisis.

“Now even Mah Jin Bu wouldn't be able to recover from that” Matt raised his hand to show how it was just liquid with clumps of solids all around him. “He was disgusting to his very end”

I wanted to help Max, but my necklace had been taken away by Max already. And, I was starting to feel relieved, that someone I argued so much with wasn't here. Someone who reminded me of Nathan wasn't here.

I was intensely attracted to Matt now. I know it was bad, but I was, I really was was!!!!    .

The teachers came forward, they ran over the black tar, they skated over the blood and clumps of bile and intestines, they all circled Matt and questioned him.

"Now it's all done, so you can explain yourself.” was the big question. The chorus stood behind Matt and asked him over and over, like a rainbow shining with all it's colours, everything came through to us.

So explain yourself" they Chorus sung, . “Is it because you felt threatened? Is it because you wanted more? Is it because you were bored? Is it because you loved Julia? Is it because you didn't like Julia? Is it because you are naturally a violent person? Is it because so much was expected of you, a whole race relied on your decisions? Is it because you wanted freedom? Is it because you felt like you weren't human enough? Is it because you are immature? Is it because you just happened to have guns? Is it because you didn't know enough about the angels? Is it because you knew so much about them that there was nothing else?”

But before anyone knew it, Matt had become surprisingly silent. He never said anything. He didn't even smile or shrug or breathe a sigh of relief.

“Why did you do all of that? It's because you hate angels right?” One of the high achieving students who had a notebook packed full of information was the first to ask.

Matt sat down on the spot, he looked to the sky with his legs crossed. He didn't look worried or regretful, or violent. He looked patient. Like a long black dragon had finally flown over him and entered the hills in the distance. It had been travelling over him for a while now.

Then in the end Lacey came out, trembling, others went to support her. Now Lacey had lost more weight, she could easily qualify for a child's ticket on the bus. 

But she didn't care about that right now.

LAST: part 7 (Reticence)


Matt usually always talked, he talked so much trash and nonsense, he always talked. But today, he didn't say a word to anyone. For the first time in forever he didn't speak a word to anyone. When he was given the opportunity to talk he chose to remain silent. It was for some reason or another and he kept silent. And it was weird because us as the world didn't hear Matt's voice for the first time in a long while. He chose to stay quiet when we needed him to speak the most.

Now it was all over and the results were set. I just wanted the answer to one question. “How did you find out?” I shouted above the fear running rampant like a tsunami over our heads and shoulders. “Who told you”

Of course I meant about Matt knowing we were Angels, and I knew that he knew what I meant. Because if he had been affected by this as I was, then it could be the only thing on his mind.

Matt quietened down before giving his answer. The first retirement from a sentence of silence. His answer was brief, and he said that the one who told him was someone much more scary than him. He was nothing in comparison to them.

“Who is it?” I said. It could have been me, or her, or she, or him, or them. Someone smiling, or someone don't smiling. But it had to be someone. Who was it?

Matt didn't answer anymore, no matter how much we budged and twisted him he was done talking for the day.


After everyone stopped looking at Matt, they looked at me. They all knew I was an angel as well. I think they had mixed feelings about me.

So I thought hard about which role to play right now. Should I act kind and sweet and popular, or be cold and hard and unenthusiastic?

I knew I should just be myself, but which one of those was myself? I could act so well now that everyone would believe me if I acted that way, it wasn't to convince them, it was about how I wanted to convince them.

LAST: part 8

Later on Lacey told me what she heard, she heard a fight between two caged zoo animals, just like stacks of paper being ripped up. She also agreed with me that Later on Lacey didn't know as much about things as Before Now Lacey. Before Now Lacey was always kinder and sweeter than Later on Lacey. But Lacey didn't seem to mind that too much.

“It was the shock of it all” she was huddled in the corner, long after the wind had blwon past and Matt had scattered. “I never expected something so violent to come out of someone so kind” she said.

“What do you mean he was kind. He's violent.

“Lacey? Are you okay darling?

Lacey's Mom came to get her. It was Mrs. Triangle, Lacey's Mom, she was wearing a skirt so short that it went up. Underneath were pant jeans, and a rainbow coloured belt. Her shoes were black pumps with a bit of heel on the back, for the bit of authority that she seeked to obtain.


“You're okay?” She crouched down, giving me a view of her butt, I saw the hole that was the first thing Lacey touched in this world. She rubbed her cold-looking hands against Lacey's cheeks. “Oh My Gosh, thank Gosh you are fine. It's scary indeed, there was a bomb right there, right here in my daughter's school, but she seems unharmed by it.” Sje rubbed over Lacey's body, looking under her uniform, rolling up the pants to see nothing was touched, she put her hand to Lacey's forehead to check for a temperature. She evem took off Lacey's shoes and put them aside politely to check her toes.

I had gone through the same things as Lacey had. I had been even closer to the bomb.

Then Mrs. Triangle looked to me. She looked up and down, and I thought she was going to check to see if I had anything wrong but she turned abck to Lacey and helped her with her shoe “I was told it was one of the students from your class” she said, “Did you know that?”

“I know Mom, stop telling me” Lacey grabbed a shoe and started throttling the laces back around her ankles. Then she grabbed the other and did the same.

“I don't want you going back to this school, what they let happen here was unbelievable” Mrs. triangle grabbed up Lacey. “I heard the boy had been carrying weapons to school for weeks”

“Ugh Mum, you're so annoying, leave me alone” 

Mrs. Triangle checked behind Lacey's ears, she was really worried and did it hurriedly. “I hope you didn't breathe any of that stuff in” she said. “Explosions can release toxic chemicals.”

“I'm fine Mum” Lacey stood up and wiped herself off, “Look, I'm fine okay?”

Lacey's Mum looked at me also sprawled on the ground, “Where were you standing?”

I thought she was concerned for me so I tried to sound like it wasn't much. “I was closer, but it's not a big deal, I'm okay”

She sighed a breath of relief and looked me up and down, “I guess if you're fine then Lacey will be fine too”

Oh, so that's what this was about. She didn't care about the burns I felt, or the worse burns to the heart I felt.


“Did you know about this?” Lacey's Mum said while pulling Lacey's laces tight..

What was with her attitude, wouldn't parents usually embrace everyone after this kind of crisis? She was treating me almost like it was my fault. “Why would I know about it?”

“Because you were always scheming with that incorrigible boy.”

“Huh?” Was this what Lacey had been telling her?

She looked me up and down again. “I bet you're tired, come home with us”

When I got into their car, we left the scene. The roof was still smoking a bit, but it just looked like it was having a cigarette, not serious smoke. When I closed the car door I was thinking that Lacey's Mum must be a straightforward speaker, and when she showed affection she showed it directly as well.


I was itching where I had burned a bit of skin, and my sotcking had a large hole in them now. I suddenly felt tired. I was just going to sit, but it became a lie down, and then a collapse. 

“Should we take her to hospital?” Lacey peered back at me. The two of them were sitting in the front like they were my parents, and I was asleep in the back. 

“She's not injured is she?”

“No”

“You're not injured right?” Lacey turned her head, I shook it.

“She says she's not” Lacey turned back forwards, she opened the front car pocket and brought out a bag of sweets and put one in her mouth

“Okay, I'll take you guys straight home and we can have some nice ice cream with custard tonight.” She turned the handle a few times, “Did you call the driving school for the lesson? Booking? You need to do it, it's important for your future.”

Lacey mumbled, “Yes...”

“And your application to University is due soon. Have you written that thing you said you needed to do?”

“Seriously Mum, you're so annoying, stop asking me every time we get in the car.”

“You need to do it if you want to go to University, how come you still haven't done it, things are coming up. What are you going to do if you don't go to University, you know we're not going to keep forking money out for you right?”


“I know, so serioulsy shut up Mom, it gets so repetitive, if I have to hear you again I'm going to pull my eyes out.”

“You'll still be able to hear her” I said.

Lacey groaned, “Fine, then I'll pull my ears out after that okaayy? Happy now?”

“That's not how you talk to your friends at school is it? That's not how you speak to all the handsome boys right?” Then she asked me, “Colita, don't you think Lacey needs to learn some manners, you seem so well behaved and polite, she should learn from you” She looked briefly at Lacey before turning back forward. “Right Lacey?”

“Get lost”

“She's rude when she talks to me, but her grades are good and she's got a lot of friends, so I think overall she's a pretty good girl.” Lacey's Mum stopped at an intersection and looked at me. 

“So, Colita, I see Lacey's friends all the time but it's the first time I've met you like this”

“I'm a new friend” I sat up and smiled, twisting my seatbelt back into place.

“I heard you were a bit different” she said.

Just what was she hearing from Lacey? I saw Lacey looking at me in the rearview mirror, but as soon as our eyes met she glanced away and ate her candy.

I decided to confess, I didn't care anymore, the worst had happened. “I'm actually not a human” I said, “I'm an angel.” 

Mrs. Triangle nodded, Lacey kept eating the candy without offering any around. They looked interested so I decided to go on.

“I wasn't born as an angel though, I was born as a human and later changed into an Angel.”

“Wow” Lacey's Mum said, “That's something”

“And that's why life in general has been hard for me, because I never really fit in wherever I go, people are always staring at me, either because I can heal, or because I'm so pretty. And I can't find a decent boyfriend either.”

Lacey laughed, “That is ssssuccch a lie, come on”

“No, and coming to the school was really difficult, because I don't know what to talk about with shallow things, I can only talk about what I've experienced, and that's all really unhealthy sad stuff that a person probably hasn't experienced before.”

“Well, people experience sad things too” Mrs. Triangle said, “We all do, you know” She turned another corner and stopped at a traffic light. She made Lacey hand one of the candies over, and I thought maybe that's what I should be doing as well, make Lacey hand a candy over, then I would get to have one as well.

“It's so hard” I said, “Because I'm not allowed to be myself, I always have to act like someone else, it's against the rules for an angel to tell others that they're an angel”

“But isn't that what you're telling us now?” Lacey said. “How come it's suddenly okay now?”

This wasn't going anywhere. “I suffered so much” I said, “More than anyone else would. And in the explosion, my boyfriend, he was dying and becoming so far away, but I couldn't do anything. There's nothing left of him, he was sprayed all over us like the rain. So there's just as much rain on me as him.”

“Oh cool” Mrs. Triangle said, “That's really crazy Colita” She sped up as we went up a hill, taking over a slow car to our left.

There was a bit of silence.

“Mum, can we have fish and chips tonight?”

“Well, you're suddenly polite, so maybe.” She laughed.

“I speak like this with everyone”

“I hope so, if your friends heard you speaking like you were to me earlier they wouldn't think you're a nice girl”

“I don't want to be a nice girl, that's so old”

“Well boys like nice girls”

“Ugh Mum, you're so annoying”

“You should learn from Colita some more, look how polite she is.”


I realized there that my confession had just been dismissed as another thing occurring in someone's life. I was waiting for them to go back to it, but it was gone.

“That's just because she's in front of you right now, usually she's a wild girl out of control.”

Lacey Mum looked in the rearview mirror at me, I moved away and she didnt' see me. So she reached out with three slender fingers and adjusted the mirror so she could see me. After studying me for a bit she turned the mirror back roughly to where it had been. “Nah, I don't think so” she said, “She looks like a very kind person”


“I do things too” I said.

Then Lacey's Mum started laughing, sshe wasn't very loud, but her chest heaved in and out like a speaker, her earrings shivered against the headrest.
 
I wondered why she found that funny, so much that it had more of an impact on her than my confession.

After I was dropped off in front of my house I thought about the car ride. I still didn't know if they dismissed my confession out of disinterest or because it was so far from their lives and they couldn't relate to it. Or maybe it felt so weird and negative for them that they didn't want to hear it and tried to change the topic.

I felt regretful that I had spoken anyhow. It had come to no use, only problems. I wasn't an angel to them, I was just some other human.

Because just a normal car ride was getting me thinking. All of these ordinary things weren't really ordinary after all, but they meant a lot didn't they?

A human would know.

### Chapter Eighty Nine
```
I will defo try to make this chapter cool to read, it's going to be fun to write as well !!!!!! :) 
And I wonder what you thought of the last chapter? Was it nice? Was it boring? What do you feel?
```

I met Matt in a cafe. He called me to come over. At this point I wasn't afraid of any violence or anything from him. But he was surprsingly kind. He sat at a table on the side cradling a warm cup of coffee. His hair had bits of the dew on it from when he leaned over to sip it.

He looked harmless. It was hard to believe that this was the monster to blame for so many deaths that had occurred.

He looked at me like a puppy getting a bath with the cutest possible eyes.

“So...what's up?” I tried to be casual. Because I didn't want him to unleash any sort of  violence, but also because I was kind of attracted to him and didn't want to look like I was coming on. I was on heat inside.

“I'm going to be taken away” he said. 

“To University?”

“No” he grinned, “Are you an idiot? You still haven't learned about human culture? You don't get taken away to University, you go there because it's the place to be”

“Then where are you going?” 

“I don't know” he said. “I'm being taken away” He raised bunny rabbit fingers and twirked them, “Because of my 'extraordinary abilities with angels'.”

“So you're also losing your freedom?” I said, half as a joke, but also dead seriously.

It didn't click with him, or he didn't hear it, but it just died there.

He took a sip of orange juice. And I felt overjoyed that he ahd invited me to be here now, so I tried to talk to him, about something light and amazing.

“So why me?” I said, “Why did you invite me?”

He leaned over the table, looking at his rough hands made for taming small thigns that played up.

“Cause you're cool” he said.

I nodded, I pretended like it meant nothing to me, like it was something completely normal. But inside it had meant more to me than the world. It meant that he actually thought something of me. I suddenly felt like I could tell him anything and he would accept it. 


“Why are you always so serious around Lacey?” It was something I had observed in him, and he acted differently around her to when he was with me.

He shrugged, “I don't know, maybe I'm supposed to become someone's friend now, maybe I'm excited to meet her? The possibilities are endless so I can't answer it right now.”

Right Now, did that mean that he was thinking of talking in the future as well?


“I'm a spontaneous man” Matt said, “I do what I want, I always have, and this huge power I've been given, to control hoardes of angels with my sperm. To impregnate all the pretty angels and spread my seed, I wanted to do it, but I always wanted to do so much else as well. And ebcause I couldn't decide, I just did whatever I wanted. It's because I have no freedom that I have to do things spontaneously.

He had always turned up different, but I knew why. I felt like I understood him when he said that. Sponatenity was a defence held by those who couldn't stay in one place.

Then I got my coffee from the waiter and thanked him. It was earluy in the morning, only a few hours after the sun had risen, and we were talking quietly about the most personal things. Matt looked at me and saw me looking, and grinned and looked down at his coffee. 


"Then why did you do all of this? You ruined everything" I said. “Doesn't the consequence mean something?”


He nodded, but didn't say anything, he was already distracted.

“Why?” she said.


“Do you like to drink juice?” he said, “Just plain orange juice, the best flavour is Arano OJ, it's a little more expensive, but the other stuff tastes like a soggy pussy, the Arano stuff just really gets my blood flowing. Imagine a trifle mixed with sour stuff, can you?”

“Okay...but answer my question”

“That's it” he said, “That's what the best orange juice tastes like, Arano orange juice”


“Matt, why did you do it? Don't you still hate me?How come you don't attack me. I thought today when I came here you were going to try to kill me.” I had come here thinking that, and knowing that, I had still come.

“I'll buy you some” he said. “I bet they have some here” He waved for the waiter and grinned at me. He was really cute when he grinned, I almost forgot about all he had done.

The waiter came over with the notepad and a tired look, “Yeah what?” Matt gave him my order,

“Are you sure?”

Matt was timid, he wasn't sure, and he looked at me. I relented, “Okay...but make sure it's only half sweetened, and no ice, please”

After the waiter left Matt finally smirked, “No ice?” “Half of the flavour comes from it's coldness, you have to have the ice, it's obligatory. 


I couldn't believe someone like him was embarrassed about talking in public. Was that why he hadn't said anything last time? “No, because it's half sweetened, so it doesn't need ice, you know when you get that feeling of ice making it sweeter? This makes it perfectly sweet, but not too sweet to miss the sourness of the orange, you know what I mean”

He frowned, “No, that's not why...” And he went on to explain why. And I coudln't believe it, but I was listening to every word, everythign he said about the orange juice, I clung onto the words and made them sink and etch into me.

What I learnt was that Max and I, we both had very specific tastes for our Orange Juice. We were classic lovers of it. I was so curious about him now, why was he talking about orange juice so passionately? Did he have any other friends? And, why was he telling me all of this? What did I mean to him? “Sorry, could you repeat that?”

“No, I said I think something's wrong with you if that's the only reason you drink Orange juice. It's like drinking ketchup because you want to eat a tomato, or like you're smoking a cigarette because you want to eat grass.”

He was smart, I was starting to feel embarrassed talking to him, ten minutes ago I was prepared to die by him, now I couldn't stop thinking about him, seriously, what was wrong with me. “Why would I want to eat grass? What's wrong with you, who does that? I know you think angels are weird, but even us Angels don't do that, like ever.”

“I'm sure you've wanted to eat grass at least once in your life, come on, don't lie”


I grinned, “No you're wrong...not at all” then put a finger to my lip, “Well...maybe just once, I wondered what it would be like to try it when I was really small.”

“See? Everyone's tried it before. It's like wanting to have sex with your siblings, it's just something that passes through your mind now and again.”

“Yeah” I laughed, “I guess so”

“And killing angels, I get that passing through my mind a lot”


My laughter died. It sank into my shoes, out of view. “That's not funny Matt, take it back.”

“Still too early for that joke?” he sipped his orange juice to the bottom and struggled with the ice, he eventually poked it out with a finger. And I wished that he would take back what he said.

But when he didn't and started talking about orange juice with ice, then I felt relieved for some reason. I was starting to respect Matt, really weirdly... I felt like all that I had up till now was unimportant anymore, like it all didn't matter and I had been focusing on superficial things.
 
“So why did they send you?” he said. “You coming to deal with me, that's like a sheep coming to tame a dragon, you know what I mean? I mean that's why you were sent right?”

He knew, just from guessing. I rubbed my eyes and slapped my cheeks three times to get the lovehearts out of my vision. They were floating all around him with a moving flower background behind him. No, Matt wasn't a flower boy. He was a real boy, a real special guy. I kept telling myself that.
{
“What are you saying?” Matt said.

“It's none of your business” I said.
}
“So why did they send you? Can you answer me now?”


“I don't know why” I shrugged and smirked, “They must have made a mistake about it”

He laughed. He was just thinking about himself so much that...I was inspired by him. He was so weird and different and passionate in his own way. I don't know why I liked him so much, he did horrible things, he destroyed everyone, it was so wrong and so bad. But I found after it that I only liked him more, and being with him here was even better. It didn't decrease over time. It defied laws. I couldn't tell anyone why, but I was in love with him. So suddenly and so inappropriately.

“When are you leaving?” I said. Trying to sound like I didn't care.

“In about three days” I tried to smile, but it was actually really really hard.

“And do you know where? Or when? Or if you will be able to come back?”

“No” I waited for more, but that was all he said. He was so talented, he was doing so much, but he didn't want to speak? I wanted to know what he was thinking, why didn't he tell me?

I was leaving too, but he didn't ask me about it.


Then our breakfasts came, Matt had a huge breakfast, I smiled and stood up cleanly, “Sorry, I'm going to the bathroom” I said.

He didn't really glance my way, he just looked into space. So I didn't wait for an answer and walked to the bathrooms. I wanted to hear him say something.

I think I was amazed by his confidence and his stupid self justifications, that must be why I was feeling this way. If I could just think about something else for long enough then it would be fine, probably. But I wondered why he even invited me if he was ignoring me so hard now.

So I went into the bathroom to listen to how I was feeling 

Desperado Eagles:

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses,
You've been out riding fences for so long now,
Oh you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
These things that are pleasing you can hurt you somehow.

I felt like I was desperate. For company. For someone to tell me I was the same. Maybe I was felt the same as Matt, because he was so messed up. That's why I wanted him to tell me something. I stared in the mirror at myself, at my hair, at my neck and my stomach out of sight. I pinched the edges of my clothes and moved my fingers to feel them. 

Was I an idiot? Dressing up like this to try and attract his attention. But he didn't even look twice.

Don't you draw the Queen of Diamonds Boy, 
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me some fine things have bene laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you cant get

Desperado, oh you aint getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home

And freedom, oh freedom, well thats just some people talking,
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

You're losing your highs and lows
Aint it funny how the feeling goes away

When I came out of the bathroom there were two people here. Five of them were angry and five of them weren't. But there was another person talking with Matt. I felt my hands tense. My back tensed, and my legs stiffened.

I saw Lacey there. She had a new bag perched on the table as a warning sign for anyone who dared approach. 

I dared, and walked past it. Lacey looked at me and smiled, “Oh Hi Colita, come sit down” she moved over and we sat side by side facing Matt.

“I don't understand” I looked up and saw Lacey.

“And I don't understand” she said, “How come you were here?” I saw that my bag was still in the corner, so she had seen it. “What were you just doing?”

“I was listening to music”

But as soon as the tension between us was resolved, the door swung open and al three of us looked at the door to see who had come in.

### Chapter Ninety
```
So, Hi, it's me in the italics again.I know I get annoying, but here goes. I actually wanted to split this chapter up, putting this next section somewhere else, but there was no where else....tears....tears...

Haha, ty.
```

We all looked to the door guess why?

Because we all knew who it was. It was someone who was partly responsible for everything that had gone along.

A wounded figure came in, it was limping, we all watched as it limped closer to us, then past out table. It had a long black rag that had never been washes, and a reaper scythe as a walking stick.

It stopped in front of me and breathed deeply. “You're Colita right? You're an angel, I;m disgusted by your behaviour, and you should follow the rules next time.”


I just looked ridiculous now, and weak and useless. In the face of this figure I was nothing. I peered over and saw that he was wearing a namebadge, it was sideways, so hard to see, but its name was Joseph. It tried to cover up the badge as soon as it noticed I was looking at it. It shook the reaper scythe in my face, trying to make me back off. It had a huge smell following it, like a weird perfume.

“Did you forget who you are? You're an angel.” It pointed a finger at Matt, “Did you forget who he is? He's a killer of angels. He killed our kind.”

Death held its reaper scythe with both hands, leaning on it like it was the stairway to heaven. “I'm only wounded” it said, “Not because of a big reason”

“How?” Lacey said, “How could you be wounded, when you're the one who's supposed to wound all of us. You go through all of us like we're grass.”

“It was a mistake” it said, trying to walk past us, “Not because I was in that blast, but because I was being chased by an enemy bigger than myself, someone that just walks and steps on me. We're all walking in her shadow, every one of us. So I was got caught in the blast.”

“Who is it?” I said. Holding my nose because it smelt so bad.

“Her name is “Problem” with a capital P, and she creates most things in the world, she works on the left hand of all creation. I recently came to the epiphany that we were all walking in her shadow.” Joseph kept talking like it meant the world to him.

“If you want to meet her, I saw her once, a long time ago, she has the face of Shakespeare and the legs made of iron steel. Her body is like jelly that bounces, but her eyes are only as big as eggs when they are closed and swallow everything when they are open. She creates all the problems in the world. And we can't escape from her shadow, when I tried, I got caught up in that explosion you humans made, and I've never been caught in an explosion before, it's a disgrace” Joseph crouched down and started crying in the aisle between our table and the neighbours' table. 

I wanted to offer him out a lollipop, but I didn't have the courge to approach him, even if he was tame, this could all be a ploy to get us to believe him. Because in the end Death just wanted to be believed, that's all it really wanted right? Because it had never ever been believed before, and only feared.

But then I realized that to Joseph this was probably something really important, something that we had just ignored.

But he wasn't human, and he wasn't angel right? He wasnt' the same as us. So it was okay to ignore what he was saying.

“You're not the same either” Matt said, “You're an angel, we're not, don't put yourself into the same category as us, against him. You're prejudiced”

“Then why do you invite me here? Do you like me?”

Joseph had stood up and went to one of the booths in the corner and sat down, it ordered a hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows on the side. The waiter treated him normally like he treated everyone else. As a body of money.

What was it doing here? In our cafe of all places. It was weird that it was here. I hoped that it didn't ruin the atmosphere, and we could still talk.

“Just chill, seriously” Lacey said. “He'd probably be pretty cool if you get to know him”

“You don't know it like I do” I said, “It was following me the whole time”

“His name is Joseph” Lacey said.

Matt supported me, “That thing being here makes me uncomfortable” he had his arms crossed and leaned over tiredly.

“If you don't like Joseph so much, then here, kill him” She dug in her purse and brought out a solid metal gun and slid it across the table, it stopped at Matt, so he uncrossed his arms and passed it along to me. I picked up the gun and felt its weight in my hands, I had held a lot of these things recently. It probably felt a lot lighter than it should have.

“Just make sure to leave its eyes closed” Matt said, “I've seen movies where people look like sh** because their eyes are open”

“It's not a human though” I said.

“His name is Joseph, at least respect that, okay?” Lacey said.

“Shh, no one's shooting anyone” I raised my hand and dropped the gun. “Just shut up” The gun hit the ground with a dead thud. The bullets crackling in its guts reminded me of Max. But I tried to wipe him from my mind.


Lacey sat back, her food still hadn't come, she scrolled through her phone. “Oh my gosh, it says it's Matt's birthday today on Facebook.” She looked at the waiter and waved him over instantly. I felt sorry for him, he was so busy for us. “I guess we'd better order a cake or something”

“A cake's good, but just make it a small one” he said, 

“You want it made of orange juice?” I said.

“No” he said, “But it's also Jason's birthday today.”

“Let's bring my sister over as well.” Lacey just wanted more company. 


“That's a waste of orange juice” I said, Lacey didn't get it and looked at both of us with a look that said Was that meant to be funny? What did I miss?


“You're late” I said, “We were discussing that ages ago”

“Using orange juice for a cake is like using your clothes for toilet paper, it's stupid” Lacey said. “And you're going to get all the rind of the oranges mixed in it.”

“That's the whole point though” I said, “Besides, if you used all the orange juice for the cake, then there wouldn't be any left for proper drinking.”

(Bring in something said earlier, make it click in the dialogue, like Teesta's joke.)

“Screw this pointless conversation, I've had enough” Lacey said, “I'm going to the bathroom” she looked for me, “You coming? Oh Just leave Matt to drink his crap in peace.”

I shrugged and moved over and we both walked to the bathroom. Matt didn't move a centimeter, he didn't need to. Us girls were all over him. Then, as we went past Jospeh's booth, Lacey, always the flirt, asked if Joseph wanted to come.

“It's the bathroom” I whispered, “He can't come right? Surely he can't follow us that far.”

“Joseph is an 'it' ” Lacey giggled, “You're so funny, what're you so nervous about?”

Joseph didn't answer, it didn't even grunt or nod. It sat there with a warm beer against its cold hands, the beer absorbed its smell.


“Was he always so antisocial?” Lacey said, after he was out of earshot.

In the bathroom we stood in front of the mirror and put our bags on the counter. Hers on the right and mine on the left, then we started comparing.

“My nose is slightly to the right” Lacey said, “Do you see it?”

“No, I think it's just that your left eye is a bit further in, so it makes it look that way.”

“Great, thanks Colita, that's really helpful”

“I'm serious, when you close your left eye you look a bit more normal”

Lacey stood there with one eye closed, and holding her ear, just to make everything look more symmetrical.

My face was perfectly symmetrical because it was shapeshifted. But otherwise I would be seriously insecure about it as well and want to change something.

“Do you think Matt likes you more than me?” Lacey said it so matter of factly that I thought she had said something like. Can you do the washing, or can you buy this for me?

“How would I know what he thinks” I brought out lipstick from my bag and started smearing my bottom lip. It was a deep erotic red.

“Because he always talks to you”

“The guy doesn't talk, he's a scarecrow”

“I always see him talking to you, and I feel like I want to be able to do that as well. Talk to him, join in with him, because...”

“Try this” I gave her my lipstick, “It's a really good color”

Lacey took the lipstick and looked at it closely under the light right above her. Then she raised it against the light to try and see the contents. “Are you sure this one is okay?”

“Okay for what?”

“For Matt”

“I don't know, you have to try it and see what he thinks. How he gazes at you.”

“Gazes? My gosh you make it sound scary”

“Every man watches us as we act, a woman knows it.”

“Whatever”

“And I also don't understand” Lacey said, “What makes his mood change so quickly? Sometimes I see him and he's really cheerful and the funniest; but on other days I see him and he's silent and dismissive and he doesn't care if I'm there or not. Do you know why? Have you had that experience as well?”


“I don't know, maybe he got another girlfriend?” 

“No way!” Lacey put both hands on the counter, “He wouldn't have...right?”

“Who knows, men are wild creatures, you can't tame them”

“If he got a girlfriend...”

“There's more than that on Matts mind” I said, “I think so anyway, so don't worry about that, that should be the least of your worries. Matt is a bad man, a very bad man.” 

ThenLacey turned the tables. She took the contents of her bag out one by one until there was only 'bag' left. It was a fake Louis Vuitton bag, and it was made of genuine snake skin. Hand cream, soap, wallet, iphone, heels, all came out of her bag. The last item that came out was a gun. It flashed under the light.

I rubbed on another layer of lipstick, “Who are you going to use that on? Is it for you or someone else?”


“I think we should get rid of Matt” Lacey said. “He's caused us all of these problems, he's a madman.”

“Just think it over” I said, “You have three days to think about it” I put my lipstick back and checked my reflection. My hair was really looking sour, it didn't have the lively spring the new brand of shampoo was supposed to give it.


“I mean, when we don't do anything and just talk, he's kind of cool I guess, he respects what I have to say. But that's only when there's no one else around. Whenever there's someone else it's like he's distracted or something.”

He's kind of cool, I guess, as long as we don't think about stuff.” I said.

“Yeah, he's no fun in school though” Lacey said, “I feel like I'm just always following him around as he hunts”

“So I guess we shouldn't attack him, I feel like we've kind of become friends” I said.

“Oh yeah, I kind of feel the same way too, it's like, it was sooo meant to be, but we never knew it, you know?”

I didn't know Lacey had also felt the same way as me, “Oh, you were so like judgmental of him, I was totally afraid you were going to do something, you were looking at me like I was stealing your man or something.”
 
“I was not, my steal-your-man look is totally different.”


“Yeah, but your expressions all look the same, like this” I tried a frown and Lacey burst out laughing. 

“Excuse me! I do not look that bad when I pout.”


“You do it all the time, even when Matt is watching”

“No! Matt never saw it right?”

“It's obvious” I said. “I mean, because I'm not always watching him I wouldn't know...”

“Excuse me, did you just speak to me with insincerity? I don't appreciate insincerity in words”

“Oh, my, gosh, you need to hear yourself. You're like almost insane. It's just too much to deal with at the moment.”


“Can you not? Talk to me like you own me?”

“Gosh, you're as anxious as a durian”

We exited the bathroom and walked back through the swingdoors like boulder rocks tumblin towards Matt. Our bags were both in our right hands and Lacey walked in front. She had changed into her heels, the outline of her flats could be seen through her bag. We sat down at the table, Matt moved hardly any, and the table became silent. I don't know if it was understanding or what.

Then we heard the customers behind us talking. They had entered since we had left from the bathroom. There were about four of them.

It was random, super random, from behind us.

“It's so good to be in the city. We walked everywhere! You know when you arrive somewhere and you just get so excited and need to go everywhere? Do you do that or nah, oh you must be so over it, it's only when you first get there.”


“The day we got to South America it was actually so surreal, it was like, 'wow, we're actually here' “ 

“When I went to Europe I felt the same way as well. Everything was beyond belief, it was so amazing. I felt like I wasn't allowed to be here.”

“Next time, we'll invite you to come over with us, then you can brag about it to her”

“I want her to come too”


They talked so warmly with each other, it was something that only human interactions could bring out, something else could probably never replace it. This behaviour was unique.


Lacey was eating her breakfast quietly, Matt sat still hugging his cup. 

New problems had arisen, even after everything finished, new problems kept coming up, welling out of nowhere, the landscape was never flat. What was never a problem was now a problem, and what was a problem before wasn't a problem anymore. 

Like this it was hard to know what was coming next.

It was out of my control.

LAST: part Ten

So I know what you guys are thinking, you guys are thinking WHEN IS THIS GUY EVER GOING TO FINISH WRITING THEIR LONG AS AND IN SOME PLACES SUPER BORING STORY??? 

The answer is SOON. Soon you're going to miss it. It flows on like life, and soon you're going to miss it. 
HAHA. Maybe.

Thanks, 

gieoon (My pen name)


In the library on one weekend, there was a reading session. Lacey invited me over to it, she said I would enjoy the time away from school. 

I looked at the noticeboard, the guest reader was Lacey Triangle, it said 
	
	Guest reader: Lacey Triangle, reading her own original short story.

Lacey had an amazing air of nurture. She called all the kids to come over with an arresting voice. “Come around me” she said, “I have a story to tell you, it's something I wrote”

The kids and adults gathered around her in the library with warm smiles and sat close to each other. Then Lacey let me sit beside her. “I'll bet you didn't know I was writing” she said. “I didn't tell anyone” I grinned, I was amazed, the only writing I did was in my diary, but she could always do everything so much better.

She sat delicately, and introduced the work. The audience was about thirty kids and their parents. “I want to read this story to you, I hope that it might change your perspective.”

The adults nodded in agreement, they loved for their kids to be educated.


“I wrote this story” she said, “Every word, with so much struggle, just to get it perfect, even if it sounds smooth, it was hard work.” She turned to me and grinned, I smiled back. She was really amazing, I thought she was all clothes and wrapping paper, but there was something in there it seemed.

The Story START:






The Story has been removed due to Copyright Restrictions:




The Story END:

I was shocked, every word in that story, it was what had been said. It was a story about an angel, who did things. It was about me. And she said she had written every word, but she had just copied every conversation we had and put it into writing.

I stared at Lacey and she smiled back, “wasn't it great?” she said, the applause around us was still going, the adults and kids had all loved it. They said it was amazing.


All of the conversations I had with Lacey, her conversations with others, everything we said, everything we did, it had all been left stuck in time, never disappearing. And the Lacey that I was looking at right now was changing into someone I didn't know. Someone who had only been acting this whole time in front of me, and everyone else. It was all just a fake story that she had been living.

How long had she been insincere for? The whole time? Was she just trying to know the people around her and making friends, so that she could tell this story?

“It was great right?” Lacey had no guilt in her, she leaned over and whispered, “I let the world see your life, by knowing it they can help”

Then after the applause died out she turned to them “Thank you everyone, I can't say this enough, but this is the most important moment of my life. When everything comes clear, and if you remember me, if you are so inclined to, then please remember me for my story, and not for the life I'm living.”

Later the audience members came up with their kids. 

“That felt like it was so true” they said, “We're so lucky that's not happening in our society today”

“That angel was so unfortunate, hopefully she lives a better life after the story, when you write the next one.” Lacey replied warmly to each comment and shook their hand.

“You're a genius writer, I'm really glad to have met you, you're going to do well in the future”

So it was kind of like saying that my life didn't matter, and it was all just to get information from me.

“It was ingenious, it sounded so real, I feel so sorry for the angel”

Lacey nodded, listening to everything intently, she was being fed like mad. “My friends told me that they were sick of me using them as a test tube, I was like an experimenter, and they were sick of it. But I needed to do it to create this master work.” They laughed when they heard that, before moving on, to where people like them went next.

Afterwards. She told me that she was glad people seemed to get it, she was raising awareness for me.

An angel could never be an author though. No one would ever read a book that an angel had written and treat it the same.

But what was worst was that one part of the story, I looked at Lacey as she read it, and I was dreading it, because I knew every word, every action. It was what I had written in my diary.

How did Lacey know about it? Did she go snooping around my diary?

Or was it all what I was imagining? Did I really forget what I wrote? Or was I just desperate? Was I paranoid that she had read my diary and was just getting worried about it?

“What's wrong Colita?” Lacey said.

“Nothing” I said.

“Come on, tell me”

“Well, I feel like my troubles were really big, and the way you described them, you made them sound like they weren't much.”


Lacey thought about it, “It wasn't that bad if you think about it, it wasn't at all, I didn't want to exaggerate it too much you know? 

“But I was really hurt, I was wounded” I could barely speak the words.

“Huh, what, could you repeat that?”

“It was a big deal for me”


“You're just imagining it all right? It happened, but it wasn't that bad okay?” She put her hand on my shoulder “Don't stress yourself”

Lacey looked over at me, proud. “You liked the story though right? I bet you never kenw I could write like that”

The crowd had vanished, and we were elft to tidy up. A few librarians helped us get everything away. Lacey looked at me a lot throughout it.

But I couldn't look back at her.

### Chapter Ninety One

```
That last chapter was a bit of an experimental one, it came out of nowhere right? Haha, yeah.

Thanks

Kevin
```



I put on my earphones. Then suddenly all of the loudness came in. The world disappeared so fast. I remembered when I was born into the world, the world appeared so fast, and then the earphones took it away. I pulled them in and out of my ears, just to go between the worlds. It took me away from these crude people, maybe if I was surrounded by angels I could go back to being the happy self that I used to be.

This mission had damaged me beyond repair. I didn't know how to be content anymore, I didn't know how to be anything else.

Then I wondered why I didn't put the earphones in earlier. If I had, then it would have saved me from all of this that has happened. If I just put them in earlier and never taken them off, then maybe I would have survived this journey in one piece. The msot important moments in my life had music in them.

I looked over at everyone sprawled around on the floor, Matt really was a beast. Some of them were moving around and agonizing. It looked like a Pollock painting. This could have been what the great man Pollock saw, this exact scene in this B grade story.

No one here could ask what had happened, because the one who did it was a really bad person with nothing redeeming in him.

I saw someone talking to me, asking me directions. It was a woman about my age, she was wearing a school uniform, it was ironed, and she had earrings that looked like Kiwi's made of Paua shells. I took out my earphones.

“So did you know where the gym was, I've asked you three times”

“Umm....I don't know, sorry”

The girl walked off, and I put my earphones back in. I overheard Max dying, he was supposed to be the man I truly loved. But I overheard him as he was dying, the other girls were talking and stressing over it. 

“I won't let them take you” one said.

“I won't let you take him” another girl said. I didn't know where they were or what they were saying, but I could accept it now.

Then I put the music back on.

```
(END. PARTLY. Inconsistent ending, Impartial ending.)

Congratulations you waded through the pool of words of s*** and you made it through the whole section, all the mini sections, so everything has pretty much finished already, now we can just all go to bed okay???

Okay??? Okoay, there's just one more part though, so don't go to bed!!! No, don't!!!

### Chapter Eighty Six - Colita the Girl

I walked down the street and saw Nathan talking to a different girl, Colessa, she didn't wave to me as I was passing, Nathan was flirting with her too. I thought I knew him, but I thought I didn't know him too.

I went past my earphones and put my hand on the front of my neck. It was bare and my necklace wasn't there. My longest companion.


“It could have been worse, it could be to do with you” Max said. “you're abusing your power so I will have to strip you of them.” But he didn't realize that the other one would pounce on him immediately once he removed my powers. It was sad because Max was actually doing the right thing, he was a textbook.

At the end, because I felt like this was the end, I used my real appearance. After I was stripped of my powers I walked back down the street after doing the supermarket run. There were shopping bags in both hands and I was already tired from carrying them for ten minutes. They were heavy, and I couldn't run and smile as effortlessly as I used to. Guys didn't turn to see me walking past on the street, they look past me at the young and pretty girls talking and walking behind me. Then I saw my friends walking towards me. Jason, and Matt, and Julia, they were all best friends now, with Colessa as well. Now that I was gone they were able to connect. Colessa saw me first and deliberately ignored me, walking past. Colessa tried to distract the others from looking my way, Matt and Jason, who were only united because of me, looked up to me but didn't recognize me. Why should they, I look completely different now. They all went past joking about something. They walked right past me without seeing me.

Then I turned back to look and saw Julia looking back at me in curiosity. Julia saw me looking and quickly returned, but I kept staring and a moment later she looked back again.  

Then she smiled. 

Today was their prom day. Matt and Jason and Nathan wore handsome and tidy suits with ties as well. Julia wore that dress that she loved so much, the one that had been hanging in her closet, the one she won over Lacey. And Colessa had something that fit her figure perfectly. They all walked past me, going to prom. Lacey came from behind them and ran up and joined in, climbing on Nathan's shoulders. She was dressed in something nice as well. I was happy to see them enjoy it. Julia had a bouquet made of fancy lettuce in memory of someone. She would place it on one of the empty seats for her. And Jason was dressing as Julia, he was wearing a dress in remembrance of her. He looked like a fatter and more manly version of Julia, bur he wore it with strange confidence.

I didn't have to be there any more, there is no need for me, no one was waiting for me. My job was here was done.

I thought about the issues to myself, how all my problems were stacked like a jenga tower, and they were leaning so much that one day they would fall and crumble.

I was so unfortunate, no one cared about angels. The friends I had made didn't recognize me. 


I met a random person and talked to him about my issues for the whole time. I didn't want to, it just started going that way. 

“You need someone to talk to” he said, “Not me though, I have to go to class”

Then as I sat there disintegrating in my own turmoil, then suddenly islanders were singing a beautiful song, with women in harmony, singing for no one in particular, no one was really listening. No one was in school. They were singing so purely, with strength and unity. But it was so beautiful on a Sunday.

The world had so much beauty to see. I realized it but I still put the music on. Now I had all the time in the world to see the nature of the human world around me. I  always wanted to. And I really could now.

Some kids walked past, up a slope, they had skateboards, so would probably come down soon. I sat on a bench on the side of the street and waited for the kids to come back down. I would see their heads appear first on the hill, then their whole body, and finally the tension sound of the skateboards.

Right now I was planning in my head, what to ask them when they came past.

But even if I asked them, I would probably never hear again, because wasn't going to take the headphones off.

CLOSING CREDITS: (Colita is dancing outside the school gates, the prominent school gates that featured again and again.)
(Music bring ssome unity into the loose structure) For ten minutes

How about a round of applause
(Inaudible)
Hey, (inaudible) Standing ovation,(inaudible) OOOaooo
Ye,yeah yeyeye

(I know these guys told you lies, and then I came and did exactly the same)
```

You look so dumb right now,
Standing outside my house,
Tryin to apologize,
You're so ugly when you cry,
Please, just cut it out.

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not,
Baby when I know you're only sorry cause you got caught.

But you put on quite a show,
really had me going,
Now it's time to go,
Curtain's finally closing.

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on an take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone
Before the sprinklers come on
Talking 'bout girl I love you you're the one
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is up

Don't tell me you're cause sorry not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

You put on quite a show
really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing

And the award for the best liar goes to you
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech again:
a—----(UNDERNEATH IT)
But you put on quite a show
vERY ENTERTAINING

But it's over now, 
Go on and take a bow



(Knowledgeable and authoritarian voice in pain)
Take a bow, the night is over,
this masquerade is getting older
Let down all the curtains down,
There's no one here, (there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines, but you do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around,
Watching you watching me
One lonely star.(One lonely star you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you,
I guess you've always known it's true,
You took my love for granted,
Why oh why,
This show is over say goodbye.

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile
All the world loves a clown

Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you play
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star. (One lonely star you don't know where you are)

I've always been in love with you,
I guess you've always known it's true,
You took my love for granted,
Why oh why,
This show is over say goodbye.

All the world is a stage,
And everyone has their part,
But how was I to know which way the story goes,
How was I to know you baby, (You break you break you break,)
You break my heart

-Madonna
(look at hwo she came to be)
I know what I want to do, I don't know how to do it.


At Auckland, had 90,000, took three months to get here.
then a month and a half later had 150,000
now might be a lot more, but still. The last part is taking aaaagggggeeeeesss to finish.

It's only been two weeks that I've been here...wow, time flies. I thought I had been here for a lot longer...

### Final Words

THE STORY FINALLY FINISHED ON 1ST OCTOBER 2015 kept getting longer and longer, but now it is finished. Colita really went through a lot, I hope she has the best.

This story was written with a lot of love. In some Queenstown cafes, but most of it was in Auckland cafes. My favourite quiet esquires owned by the HK people, the esquires next to the library. And in Gloria Jeans as well.
Some of it was written in the library, but it wasn't really done much there.
It went from Queenstown, to Auckland, and then eventually the last 80,000 or so were written here, in Mt. Cook. I went to the bar every day after work to write this, and it's turning out really interesting. 

Now...I'm starting the next one HAHA Thank you very much for reading it. It really means a lot to me. 

I can't believe I've only been in Mt. Cook two weeks, it feels like a lot longer, because all the time I am struggling with thoughts of a girl I am crazy about. I can't believe that I met her only so recently. I always thought it was two and a half weeks, or three weeks ago, but it hasn't even been that long.
It's because I've made so many friends and met so many people, that's why I feel like more time has passed. And also because YY feels a lot further away than she actually is.

I've talked to Eins twice, so about once a week then. And Iv'e been struggling with work as well, as my moods.

So I can only hope and try my best to make thigns work out, try and get with this girl that I'm so touched by, and try and make a business and a  job out of it. So that I can try and help people all around the world with it.

Oh God, please help me.

### Additional Scenes

(Prologue about Max choosing Colita for the job, because he heard something about her, otherwise he may not have chosen her, show how it's just bad luck that she was involved in this.)
Because Colita is immature and has never had a boyfriend
(Like in Ex Machina when the guy is chosen over her)
Or like in Rookies when teacher is chosen just to help get the students fired.)

Part II
(This doesn't happen in the story, but is a hypothetical situation that may or may not happen, I found it cool so I just punched it in here...ehehe forgive me leh.)

This girl claimed that she was Colessa. Meanwhile, the other Colessa was in the school and talking to the boys.
