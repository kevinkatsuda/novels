# Introduction to My World

These are the novels I've written. They're not the _only_ ones I've written, but they're the only ones I've finished. And I thought it would be good to post them publicly before they are replaced by __AI__.

Each of them has common themes, but also some general concepts that change as I move around to different places, and experience new things. I am sure you will find something you can relate to.

__Common Themes:__

- Loneliness (I feel this a lot, almost everywhere)
- Romance
- Insecurity

__Housekeeping:__

1. There may be some adult themes, so please refrain from reading if you are sensitive or underaged
2. I am still working/dreaming up a system to add comments, so you guys can leave comments wherever you feel inspired to, I hope to have this feature integrated soon.
3. These novels are rusty early drafts, there are likely to be numerous grammatical or logical issues that you will stumble on. Knowing this, I am uploading all of this directly to Github, and if you are so inclined you may edit the text, or suggest edits and this will create a Pull Request to be approved. (This is Developer talk) Otherwise, just let me know if you want to edit something. 
4. For any inquiries/suggestions I am available at __jun.a.kagaya@gmail.com__, Let me know what can be improved
5. This site was built using something called [Mkdocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html), it's pretty easy to setup if you're looking for something simple and are comfortable typing a few commands into a UNIX shell 

With that aside, I hope you enjoy these heartfelt nuggets.
